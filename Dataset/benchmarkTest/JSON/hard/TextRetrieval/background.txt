A JSON file consists of a dictionary or array. A dictionary is a set of key:value (ordered) pairs separated by comma enclosed in {}. An array is a list of values separated by comma enclosed in []. Value could be one of string, number, dictionary, array, null or boolean. Keys are strings.
To find the object with specified key:value pair, you should lookup the whole input file for the pair. Once located, find its parent by searching the innermost {} pairs and that dictionary is the right answer. To find the deepest object(s), search for array or dictionary whose values do not contain array or dictionary.
