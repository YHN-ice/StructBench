A JSON file consists of a dictionary or array. A dictionary is a set of key:value (ordered) pairs separated by comma enclosed in {}. An array is a list of values separated by comma enclosed in []. Value could be one of string, number, dictionary, array, null or boolean. Keys are strings.
To find value by key, you should lookup dictionary for exactly matching key. To find a value by index(sequence number), you should iterate array and ends at the specifid position. You should start path walking from the outermost value in file, i.e., the dictionary or array derived from parsing the whole input file.
