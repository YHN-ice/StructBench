A JSON file consists of a dictionary or array. A dictionary is a set of key:value (ordered) pairs separated by comma enclosed in {}. An array is a list of values separated by comma enclosed in []. Value could be one of string, number, dictionary, array, null or boolean. Keys are strings.
To compose a path to some value, you should locate the value in the input file first. If its parent is a dictionary, the path relative to its parent should be the respective key in parent dictionary. If its parent is an array, path relative to parent should be the index in its parent. Then, compose path to the parent recursively, and append the relative path (enclosed in []) to its parent to the composed path. The base case should be the outermost value, which is the value represented by the whole file and has obj as its path, as indicated in Question.
