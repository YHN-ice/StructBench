In this case, you have a nested dictionary where each nested dictionary has a \"subs\" key that contains another nested dictionary. You can follow this path to access the desired values.\n\nRemember that if you have more nested objects after \"subs\", you need to use the index of the last nested object to access its \"X\" key.
