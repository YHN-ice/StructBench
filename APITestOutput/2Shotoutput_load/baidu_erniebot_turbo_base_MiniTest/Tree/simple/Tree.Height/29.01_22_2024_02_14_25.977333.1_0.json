        "Both of your inputs are trees, not directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A tree is a graph in which there is no path between any two nodes that does not pass through a root node. The height of a tree is equal to the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.\n\nHowever, the given inputs do not have any leaves. In other words, they do not represent a tree, but rather they represent the connections between nodes in a directed graph. In a directed graph, the edges represent the direction of information flow or influence between nodes, and there are no \"leaf\" nodes.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to answer your question because the input does not represent a tree. If you have a DAG represented as a graph, you can calculate the height of the root node by counting the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any node that is not reachable from the root node. However, this requires you to define what it means for a node to be \"reachable\" from the root node.\n\nIn your specific case, it seems like you have defined a set of nodes and their connections, but you have not provided enough information to calculate the height of the root node. You would need to define how you would like to represent reachability from the root node, and then you could use this information to calculate the height of the root node.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have more specific questions about DAGs or tree structures, feel free to ask me."
