Inserting an unsupported data type or formatting a value incorrectly can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Nesting and Hierarchy**: JSON objects and arrays can be nested within each other. Errors in the hierarchy or incorrect nesting can cause parsing to fail.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: The file must be encoded in a supported character set, typically UTF-8. If the file is not properly encoded, it may lead to parsing errors.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it may pose performance issues or even exceed memory limits for the parser.\n\n6. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments. If the file contains comments, it is not valid JSON and will cause parsing to fail.\n\n7. **Unescaped Characters**: Special characters in strings need to be escaped.
