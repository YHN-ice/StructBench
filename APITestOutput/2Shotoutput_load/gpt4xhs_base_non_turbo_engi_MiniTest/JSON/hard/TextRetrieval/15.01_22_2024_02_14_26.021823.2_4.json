We will need to differentiate between these types to find objects without list or dict values.\n\n3. **Multiple Deep Objects**: There could be multiple objects at the same depth level, requiring a comprehensive search to find all instances.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Data**: The structure of the JSON file might be inconsistent, with different objects having different depths or structures. This can make it challenging to automate the process of finding the deepest nested objects.\n\n5. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it could be memory-intensive to load and parse the entire file into memory at once. Streaming or incremental parsing techniques might be needed.\n\n6. **Encoding and Format Issues**: The file might have encoding issues or might not be properly formatted as JSON, which would require error handling before parsing.\n\n7. **Recursion Limits**: If using a recursive approach to traverse the JSON data, there may be system recursion limits that could be exceeded with very deep nesting.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the process usually involves recursively traversing the JSON structure while keeping track of the depth and type of each value. Once the traversal is complete, we would extract excerpts of the JSON representing the most deeply nested objects that only contain primitive data types or empty objects/collections. \n\nNow, please provide the JSON file or its contents so I can attempt to parse it and answer your question."
