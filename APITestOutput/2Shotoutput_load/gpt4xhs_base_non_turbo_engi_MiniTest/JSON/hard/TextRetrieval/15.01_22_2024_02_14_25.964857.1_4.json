This means we must have a clear criterion for what constitutes a \"most deeply nested\" object.\n\n3. **Variability in Data Types**: The values in JSON can be strings, numbers, JSON objects, arrays, booleans, or null. We need to handle each type accordingly and ensure that we're correctly identifying when an object has no further nested objects or arrays.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to process it all at once due to memory constraints.\n\n5. **Circular References**: Although rare and usually considered bad practice, JSON structures can have circular references (where an object references itself directly or indirectly). This can create an infinite loop if not handled properly.\n\n6. **Formatting and Readability**: JSON files can be minified (with no unnecessary whitespace), which makes it hard to read and understand without proper formatting.\n\nTo deal with these obstacles:\n\n- We need to recursively traverse the JSON structure, keeping track of the depth of each object.\n- We should define a function that checks whether an item is a non-nested object (no further dicts or lists inside).\n- We must handle different data types carefully, checking the type of each value as we traverse the structure.\n- For large files, we might need to stream the file and parse it incrementally instead of loading it into memory all at once.\n- Detect and handle circular references to avoid infinite loops.\n- Reformat the JSON for readability if necessary before processing.\n\nOnce you provide the JSON input, I will proceed with parsing it according to these considerations and identify the most deeply nested objects without any lists or dicts as values."
