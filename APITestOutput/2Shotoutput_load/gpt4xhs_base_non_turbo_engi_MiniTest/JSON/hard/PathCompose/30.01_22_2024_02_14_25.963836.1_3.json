To access a specific value, you must correctly navigate through the nested layers. This can be complex if the structure is deeply nested or not well documented.\n\n2. **Keys with Similar Names**: If the JSON file has keys with similar or identical names at different levels of the hierarchy, it can be confusing to determine which key path leads to the desired value.\n\n3. **Array Indexes**: If the value is part of an array, you need to know the exact index of the element. This can be problematic if the array is dynamic and its content changes over time.\n\n4. **Typographical Errors**: Mistyping key names or indexes may lead to incorrect paths and failure to retrieve the value.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity**: Key names in JSON are case-sensitive. Care must be taken to match the exact case of the key names in the JSON structure.\n\n6. **Data Types**: JSON supports different data types (e.g., string, number, object, array, boolean, null). Ensuring that you're accessing the right type (e.g., trying to use an index on an object or a key on an array) is important.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is not properly encoded, this could lead to issues when parsing or accessing the data.\n\n8. **File Size and Memory**: Large JSON files could lead to performance issues or memory constraints, making it difficult to parse and access specific data points.\n\n9. **Versioning**: If the structure of the JSON file changes over time (due to version updates), paths to certain values might change, and hardcoded access paths may become obsolete.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one should carefully inspect the structure of the JSON data, validate that it is well-formed, and ensure that all keys and indexes are correctly identified and used in accessing the desired value."
