A missing bracket, a misplaced quote, or an incorrect comma can lead to errors.\n\n7. **Large files**: For extremely large JSON files, efficiency becomes a concern. The processing time and memory usage could become problematic.\n\n8. **Encoding issues**: If the JSON file is not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), some values might not be correctly interpreted, especially for non-ASCII characters.\n\nTo properly parse a JSON file and access the desired value, I would need to see the structure of the file.
