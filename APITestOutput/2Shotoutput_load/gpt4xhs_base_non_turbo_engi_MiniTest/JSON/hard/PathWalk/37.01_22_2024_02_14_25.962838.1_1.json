If the objects in \"subs\" do not all have an \"id\" field, it could make fetching the first \"id\" non-trivial.\n\n3. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it could pose performance issues in reading and parsing the file before even attempting to locate the desired information.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports various data types, such as numbers, strings, objects, and arrays. The \"id\" could be a numeric value or a string, and handling different types might require different parsing logic.\n\n5. **Indexing**: Arrays in JSON are zero-indexed. The first element is at index 0, and this must be taken into account when fetching the first object's \"id\".\n\n6. **Key Naming**: JSON keys are case-sensitive. Therefore, \"id\", \"ID\", \"Id\", etc., would be considered different keys.\n\n7. **File Access**: Accessing the JSON file itself could be a hurdle if there are file permissions or path resolution issues.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: If the JSON file contains syntax errors, this could prevent successful parsing of the file.\n\n9. **Ambiguity in Specification**: The term \"first object\" could be ambiguous if there is more than one array or list at the same level of hierarchy and it's not clear which one is referred to by \"subs\".\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, actual parsing or answering questions about the contents of the file can only proceed once these issues are addressed or accounted for.
