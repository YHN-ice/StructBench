The parser must be able to distinguish between objects that are terminal (containing only primitive data types or empty structures) and ones that are not.\n\n3. **Handling Multiple Types**: JSON supports various data types, including strings, numbers, objects (dictionaries), arrays (lists), booleans, and null. The parser must handle all these types correctly.\n\n4. **Varied Object Paths**: There could be multiple paths leading to objects with the same depth, and all such instances should be identified.\n\n5. **Large Files and Performance**: If the JSON file is very large, performance can become an issue. Efficient algorithms and data structures are necessary to handle large files.\n\n6. **Correctly Extracting and Formatting Output**: The parser must extract only the required objects and format them correctly for output, separated as specified without any additional characters or structures.\n\n7. **Ambiguities in \"Most Deeply Nested\" Definition**: Depending on the definition used, there might be ambiguities in what counts as \"most deeply nested.\" For instance, an object at a certain depth might contain several primitives but no further nested structures — does this count as more or less deeply nested than another object at the same depth with fewer primitives but also no nested structures?\n\nThe parser must be robust enough to handle these challenges to accurately identify the most deeply nested objects in the given JSON file."
