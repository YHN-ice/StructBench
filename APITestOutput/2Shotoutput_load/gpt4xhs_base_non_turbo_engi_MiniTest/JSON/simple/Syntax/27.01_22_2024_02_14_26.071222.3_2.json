Errors in data typing can cause parsing issues.\n\n3. **Encoding Problems**: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8, and any deviation may cause issues.\n\n4. **Nesting and Hierarchy Issues**: Incorrectly nested objects or arrays can lead to structural problems.\n\n5. **Duplicate Keys**: While JSON format allows duplicate keys, it might cause confusion as most parsers will only consider the last key-value pair.\n\n6. **Trailing Commas**: JSON does not allow trailing commas at the end of lists or objects.\n\n7. **Missing or Extra Comma**: Omitting a comma between elements in an array or between members of an object, or adding an extra comma where it's not needed can lead to errors.\n\n8. **Unquoted Keys**: In JSON, keys must always be strings and hence should be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n9. **Special Characters**: Special characters in strings should be properly escaped using a backslash (\\).\n\n10. **Comments**: JSON does not support comments; their inclusion would lead to errors.\n\n11. **Infinite Loops or Recursion**: While not a structural error per se, certain JSON structures can cause issues when attempting to deserialize into programming language structures if they imply infinite loops or deep recursion.\n\nOnce we see the actual JSON file, we can check for these potential errors."
