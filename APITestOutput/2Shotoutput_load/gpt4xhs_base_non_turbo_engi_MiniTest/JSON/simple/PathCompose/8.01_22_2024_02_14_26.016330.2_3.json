Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to access a value, like \"x\", from a JSON file:\n\n1. **Nested Structure**: JSON files can have a deeply nested structure with objects within objects and arrays within objects (or vice versa). This nesting can make it challenging to determine the correct path to the desired value.\n\n2. **Arrays vs. Objects**: JSON objects are denoted by curly braces `{}`, and arrays are denoted by square brackets `[]`. It's important to know whether you're accessing an object or an array at each level because the syntax for accessing elements within them is different (key for objects and index for arrays).\n\n3. **Key Names**: If the keys in the JSON objects have unusual characters or spaces, they may require different syntax to access (e.g., `obj['key with space']` instead of `obj.keyWithSpace`).\n\n4. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the value accessed is of the expected data type is important. For instance, if \"x\" is supposed to be a number, but it's returned as a string, this might cause issues in the logic that depends on the value.\n\n5. **Dynamic Paths**: Sometimes the path to a value might not be static, which means you may need to iterate over arrays or check for the existence of keys before accessing them to avoid errors.\n\n6. **Large Files**: When dealing with large JSON files, it can be cumbersome to navigate through the data manually to find the correct path.\n\n7. **Encoding and Special Characters**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is not properly encoded, it may result in parsing errors or incorrect accesses.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: Accidentally mixing up the syntax for accessing objects and arrays, missing quotes around keys, or other such errors can lead to incorrect results or exceptions.\n\n9. **Error Handling**: While accessing nested values, there's a risk of encountering `undefined` or `null` values which can lead to runtime errors if not properly checked.\n\nOnce we have the actual JSON file, we'll need to carefully navigate through its structure, taking into account these potential difficulties, to access the value of \"x\"."
