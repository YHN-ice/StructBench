Arrays: If \"x\" is within an array, you will need to know the correct index to access it.\n\n3. Similar Keys: If the JSON contains multiple keys with similar names, it may be confusing to identify which one contains the value \"x\".\n\n4. Large Files: If the JSON file is very large, it may be overwhelming to locate the specific key-value pair without a search function or a clear understanding of the file's structure.\n\n5. Dynamic Structures: If the structure of the JSON is dynamic and not consistent, it could be hard to predict the path to \"x\".\n\n6. Syntax Errors: If there are syntax errors in the JSON file, it might not be parsed correctly, which can prevent accessing any values at all.\n\n7. Encoding Issues: If the file encoding is not handled correctly, some characters may not display as intended, leading to confusion when identifying keys.\n\n8. Data Types: JSON supports different data types (object, array, string, number, boolean, null). Ensuring that you handle these correctly when accessing \"x\" is important.\n\n9. Key Sensitivity: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so \"X\" and \"x\" would be considered different keys.\n\nOnce I am able to view the JSON file, I can provide a more accurate path to access the value \"x\"."
