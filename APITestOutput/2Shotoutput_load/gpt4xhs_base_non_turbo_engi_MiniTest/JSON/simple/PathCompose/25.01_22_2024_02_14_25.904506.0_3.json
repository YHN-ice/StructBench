Mistaking one for the other could lead to errors.\n\n3. **Similar Keys**: If the JSON contains keys with similar or identical names at different levels of the structure, it can be confusing to determine which key to access.\n\n4. **Dynamic Data**: Sometimes the structure of the JSON might not be consistent, with keys appearing in some objects but not in others, making it harder to predict the correct path.\n\n5. **Type Mismatch**: It's important to ensure that the types match what's expected (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) when accessing values to avoid type errors.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it can be cumbersome to manually locate the path to the required value.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: JSON syntax is strict and small mistakes like missing commas or quotes can result in errors while parsing.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file has encoding issues or special characters, it may throw errors or return unexpected results when parsed.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, it's important to carefully inspect the JSON structure, understand the distinction between arrays and objects, and use proper error handling when parsing.
