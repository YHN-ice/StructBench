Nested Structures: The \"subs\" might be nested within other objects or arrays. Understanding the structure and navigating to the correct level to find the \"subs\" will be crucial.\n\n3. Large File Size: If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to quickly locate the required information without an efficient way to traverse the data.\n\n4. Multiple \"subs\" Keys: There could be multiple keys with the name \"subs\" within the JSON file, and distinguishing which one is being referred to in the question would be necessary.\n\n5. Ambiguity in Question: If the question is not clear about which \"subs\" it is referring to (in case there are multiple), there could be confusion as to which \"id\" to provide.\n\n6. Encoding Issues: If the JSON file includes special characters or different encodings, it may affect how text is parsed or displayed.\n\n7. Data Types: JSON supports different data types, so ensuring that \"id\" is accessed as the correct type (e.g., string vs. integer) would be important.\n\nNow, please provide the JSON file so I can attempt to extract the required information."
