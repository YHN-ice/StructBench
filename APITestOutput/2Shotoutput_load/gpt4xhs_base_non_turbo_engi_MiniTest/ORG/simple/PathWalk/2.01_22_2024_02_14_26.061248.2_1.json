Different levels of headings must be recognized accurately.\n\n3. **Formatting Variations**: ORG files can include various formatting elements like lists, links, and more. Preserving the original formatting in the excerpt can be challenging.\n\n4. **Embedded Content**: If the subsection contains embedded content like code blocks, tables, or other special blocks, they need to be parsed and included accurately.\n\n5. **Character Encoding**: If the ORG file uses a character encoding that is not properly handled, it might lead to incorrect interpretation of the text.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the ORG file is very large, finding the correct subsection could take time and might require efficient searching or parsing strategies.\n\n7. **External References**: The subsection might contain references to external files or links that are not part of the ORG file itself.\n\n8. **Incomplete Data**: If the ORG file is incomplete or improperly formatted, it might not be possible to identify sections and subsections correctly.\n\nOnce the input ORG file is provided, these difficulties can be addressed with appropriate parsing strategies to extract the requested content."
