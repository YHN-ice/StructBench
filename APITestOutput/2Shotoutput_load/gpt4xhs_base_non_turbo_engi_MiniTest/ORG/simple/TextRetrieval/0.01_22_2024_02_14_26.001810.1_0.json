It is typically surrounded by asterisks like `*bold*`. However, there could be variations or errors in the markup that need to be accounted for.\n\n2. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as for list items or headings. These should not be confused with bold text markers.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links or code blocks, which could complicate extraction.\n\n4. **Line Breaks**: Bold text that spans multiple lines might be challenging to detect if the parser expects inline formatting only.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks that are meant to be shown as literal asterisks (using a backslash to escape them, like `\\*not bold\\*`) should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n6. **Contextual Understanding**: The parser needs to understand the context of the asterisks to distinguish between bold formatting and other uses of asterisks in the document.\n\n7. **Mixed Formatting**: Text may have mixed formatting (e.g., bold and italic), which might affect the extraction process.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might not consistently follow the syntax rules, making it harder to reliably extract bold text.\n\n9. **Large Files and Performance**: If the ORG file is very large, it could pose performance issues for some parsers, although this is less of a concern for text-based processing.\n\nIf you provide the ORG file content, I can demonstrate how to extract bold text from it."
