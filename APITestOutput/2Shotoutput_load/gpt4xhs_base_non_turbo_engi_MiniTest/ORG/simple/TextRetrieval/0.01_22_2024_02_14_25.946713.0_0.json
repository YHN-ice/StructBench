The parser must correctly identify this pattern.\n\n2. **Dealing with variations and inconsistencies**: There may be variations in how bold text is marked or inconsistencies within the file. For example, spaces between asterisks and text (`* bold *`) or incorrect use of asterisks might cause issues.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting, such as links or code blocks. The parser must discern only the bold text while ignoring other formats.\n\n4. **Multiline bold text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must be capable of recognizing and extracting it correctly without losing the intended formatting.\n\n5. **Escape characters**: Asterisks used as literals rather than formatting markers need to be correctly ignored by the parser.\n\n6. **File structure and size**: The size of the file and its structure can affect the performance of the parser. Large files with complex hierarchies can make parsing slower and more complicated.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a parser that can handle regex patterns (for identifying bold syntax), context-aware processing (for nested formats and multiline text), and performance considerations for large or complex ORG files."
