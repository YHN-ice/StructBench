Parsing will require correctly identifying this pattern amidst other text.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements such as links, lists, or italicized text. The parser must handle these without falsely identifying or missing bold segments.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape asterisks to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting. These should not be confused with actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Bold text might span multiple lines or contain additional whitespace that needs to be handled properly during extraction.\n\n5. **Special Org-mode Features**: Org-mode has many special features, like footnotes, code blocks, or tables that might contain asterisks, which could potentially confuse a simple parser if it does not account for these features.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: If the org file contains errors where the bold formatting is not properly closed, it might lead to challenges in determining where bold text starts and ends.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for creating lists or headlines in Org-mode, so it's important to differentiate between these uses and actual bold text formatting.\n\nThe parser needs to be designed in a way that can handle all these potential issues to successfully extract the bold texts."
