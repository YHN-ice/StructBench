This means the parser must discern terminal values (strings, numbers, booleans, nulls) from non-terminal values (lists, dictionaries).\n\n5. **Multiple Deeply Nested Objects:** There may be several deeply nested objects which are at the same depth, and all these have to be identified.\n\n6. **Preserving Formatting and Order:** If the output requires excerpts \"as they appear in the YAML file,\" it means preserving the original formatting and order in which these deep objects are encountered.\n\n7. **Error Handling:** YAML files may contain errors or may not conform to the YAML specification, so the parser should handle such cases gracefully.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a YAML parser needs to systematically traverse the structure, keeping track of the current depth and type of each value encountered.
