Understanding the hierarchy and navigating through nested lists and dictionaries might be challenging.\n\n3. **Multiple Documents:** A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. It is essential to identify the correct document that contains the `subs` data structure.\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors:** YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors for repeating structures. This can complicate the retrieval of data if it's not clear where the anchor is defined or what it represents.\n\n5. **Data Types:** Ensuring correct interpretation of data types (e.g., string vs. integer) when accessing object properties is crucial for providing an accurate answer.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Query:** The term \"first object's id\" could be ambiguous depending on whether \"first\" refers to the topmost object in a list or if there's some sorting or ordering criteria that hasn't been specified.\n\n7. **Large Files and Performance:** If the YAML file is large, it may impact performance and the time it takes to parse and extract the required information.\n\nOnce I have access to the YAML input, it will be essential to address these potential difficulties to accurately parse the file and answer your question about the first object's id within `subs`."
