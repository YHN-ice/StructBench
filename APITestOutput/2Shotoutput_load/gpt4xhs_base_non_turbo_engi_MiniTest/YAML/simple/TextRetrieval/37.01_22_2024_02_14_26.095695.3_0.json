If these are used, it could complicate the retrieval of the object if it's referenced indirectly.\n\n3. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If the object with id \"m\" is in a document that is not the first, it might be overlooked without careful parsing.\n\n4. **Variability in Key Names**: The key name for the id might vary (e.g., `id`, `ID`, `identifier`, etc.), which requires the parser to account for potential variability in key naming.\n\n5. **Non-Standard Extensions**: Some YAML files might use non-standard extensions or custom formats that could complicate parsing.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: If the YAML file contains syntax errors, it could prevent correct parsing and retrieval of the data.\n\n7. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is particularly large, it might be challenging to efficiently locate the specific object without performance issues.\n\nTo properly assist with identifying the object with id \"m\", I will need to see the actual content of the YAML file to navigate these potential issues.
