You've specified that we're looking for objects where no value is of type list or dict. Therefore, we need to differentiate between values and new nesting levels.\n\n3. **Multiple deeply nested objects**: There may be multiple objects at the same maximum depth, all of which would need to be identified.\n\n4. **Scalar values**: Ensuring that scalar values (strings, numbers, booleans) are correctly identified as the end nodes in the hierarchy.\n\n5. **Inheritance and references**: YAML supports node reuse through anchors and aliases, which could complicate the understanding of the structure without proper parsing.\n\n6. **Variations in formatting**: YAML is sensitive to whitespace and formatting. Proper parsing must account for these variations to accurately interpret the structure.\n\n7. **Error handling**: The YAML might contain syntax errors or be malformed, which would need to be handled gracefully while attempting to find the most deeply nested objects.\n\n8. **Nested empty dictionaries or lists**: It's important to recognize when a nested list or dictionary is actually empty, as it might still be considered a deeply nested object even though it doesn't contain further nested items.\n\nTo ensure we can handle these challenges properly, a robust YAML parser that can navigate and keep track of the nesting levels is required.
