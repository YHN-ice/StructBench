It's important to differentiate between commented-out sections and actual content.\n\n6. **External Files:** The document might include external files using commands like `\\input` or `\\include`, which can contain significant portions of the document's content. Without access to these files, some content may not be retrievable.\n\n7. **Nested Sections:** Sections can be nested within others, so identifying the correct \"1st subsection under 1st section\" may require parsing nested structures accurately.\n\n8. **Custom Macros:** The document might use custom macros that change how sections and subsections are defined, which can make it difficult to rely on standard LaTeX commands for identifying them.\n\n9. **Encoding Issues:** If the file uses a non-standard text encoding or includes special characters outside of ASCII, it may be necessary to ensure that these are correctly interpreted.\n\n10. **Version Control Commands:** If the LaTeX file is under version control (e.g., with Git), there may be conflict markers or version control comments that have to be ignored to get the correct content.\n\nWithout seeing the LaTeX file, these are some general difficulties we might anticipate.
