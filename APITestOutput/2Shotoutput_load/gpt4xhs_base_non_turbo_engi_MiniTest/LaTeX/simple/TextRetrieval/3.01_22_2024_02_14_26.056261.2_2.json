We'll need to account for all possible variations.\n\n2. Variations in syntax: Even within a single command like `\\includegraphics`, there might be variations in syntax. Options could be included in square brackets, and the file path could be in curly braces or without them, depending on the style used by the author.\n\n3. Relative and absolute file paths: The figures could be included with either relative or absolute paths, and the paths could contain various directory separators (such as `/` or `\\\\`).\n\n4. File extensions: Some LaTeX documents include the file extension when including figures (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`), while others omit it because LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type.\n\n5. Commented lines: Some lines that include figure inclusion commands might be commented out with `%`. These should not be considered as they are not active in the final document.\n\n6. Multiple figures on one line: There could be lines where multiple figures are included, so we must be careful to extract all file names from such lines.\n\n7. Multiple lines for a single figure: A single figure command may span multiple lines due to formatting or line-wrapping, which can complicate extraction.\n\n8. Encapsulation within environments: Figure inclusion commands could be encapsulated within different environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), which might not affect file inclusion but could affect how the parser locates these commands.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to write a parser that can handle these variations intelligently, possibly using regular expressions or other text processing techniques to robustly identify and extract file paths."
