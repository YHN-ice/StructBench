They might include relative or absolute paths, and sometimes even variables in the path.\n\n3. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that modify the behavior of the command but are not part of the filename.\n\n4. **Commented lines**: Some lines including figure filenames might be commented out with `%`, which should not be considered as included figures.\n\n5. **Multiple figures in one line**: There could be multiple figures included on a single line, which means that the parser should be able to handle multiple matches in one line.\n\n6. **Non-standard file extensions**: While common image file extensions are `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.pdf`, LaTeX can include images with almost any extension, or even no extension at all.\n\n7. **Environment encapsulation**: Figures might be included within LaTeX environments like `figure` or `subfigure`, which could affect how the inclusion line is parsed.\n\n8. **Complex commands**: Some LaTeX documents might include figures using complex custom commands or wrappers, which may not follow the standard `\\includegraphics` syntax.\n\nUnderstanding and handling these issues is crucial for accurately extracting all figure filenames from a LaTeX document.
