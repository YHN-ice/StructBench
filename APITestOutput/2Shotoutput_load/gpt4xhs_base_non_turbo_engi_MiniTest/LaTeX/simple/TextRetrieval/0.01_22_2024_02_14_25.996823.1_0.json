We will need to identify all possible ways bold text can be indicated in the file.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Braces Matching**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to enclose the text affected by a command.

We need to ignore these comments when parsing.\n\n6. **Conditional Statements**: There might be conditional statements in the LaTeX code that could affect whether text is actually bold or not when compiled.\n\n7. **Broken Code**: If the LaTeX code is incomplete or has errors, it can be challenging to parse it correctly.\n\nOnce you provide the LaTeX input, I'll attempt to extract the bold texts considering these potential challenges."
