Identifying all possible ways bold text can be formatted is crucial.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting commands or environments. The parser must handle nested structures and still correctly extract the bold text.\n\n3. **Custom Macros and Environments**: Users can define custom macros or environments that result in bold text. Without knowing these definitions, a parser might not be able to identify bold text formatted in this way.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX files can contain comments, which start with `%`. Text within comments should not be considered part of the actual content and hence should be ignored by the parser.\n\n5. **Complex Environments**: Complex environments like tables, figures, or custom blocks might contain bold text, and the rules for parsing these environments may differ from the main text.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Special characters like `{`, `}`, and `\\` are used in LaTeX for formatting purposes. The parser must correctly interpret these characters and not confuse them with regular text.\n\n7. **Brace Matching**: Since LaTeX uses braces `{}` to enclose arguments for commands, the parser must correctly match opening and closing braces, even when they are nested.\n\n8. **Conditional Text**: LaTeX allows for conditional compilation using `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`, etc. The parser needs to evaluate these conditions to determine which text is actually included in the final document.\n\nFor accurate parsing, the program must be able to handle these scenarios properly to ensure that it only extracts text that is intended to be bold in the final document."
