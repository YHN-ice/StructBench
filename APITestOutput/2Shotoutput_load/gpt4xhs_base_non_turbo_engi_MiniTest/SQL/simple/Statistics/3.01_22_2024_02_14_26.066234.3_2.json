Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows might have missing or incomplete gender information, which would need to be addressed either by making assumptions or omitting these entries from the count.\n\n3. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: The datatable might use different terms or abbreviations to indicate gender (e.g., \"F\", \"Female\", \"Woman\", etc.), and I would need to identify all the variations used for females.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: If the datatable contains duplicate rows for the same individual, care must be taken to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n5. Inconsistent PrimeKey Usage: If the primeKey is not used consistently to identify the same individual across multiple rows, there may be a risk of either overcounting or undercounting.\n\n6. Data Spanning Multiple Tables or Files: If the gender data is spread across multiple tables or files, these will need to be joined or cross-referenced correctly to ensure accurate counting.\n\n7. Case Sensitivity: The case sensitivity of data entries could pose a challenge if not handled properly (e.g., \"female\" vs. \"Female\").\n\n8.
