Duplicate Records: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, duplicate records would need to be identified and filtered out to avoid counting the same person multiple times.\n\n4. Inconsistent Data Entry: The work location (GA) might be recorded inconsistently (e.g., Georgia, G.A., ga), requiring normalization of text data for accurate comparisons.\n\n5. Ambiguous Height Measurement: The term \"taller than 151\" could imply either 151 cm, 151 inches, or another unit of measurement. Clarification would be needed to ensure proper comparison.\n\n6. Large Dataset: If the dataset is very large, it might pose computational challenges and require efficient parsing algorithms or tools to handle the data effectively.\n\n7. Data Integrity: Data entries might contain errors or typos, which could lead to incorrect categorization or exclusion of relevant records.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to ensure that height data is present and standardized, remove duplicate records based on primeKey, normalize location data, clarify the unit of measurement for height, and use appropriate parsing techniques that can handle large datasets accurately."
