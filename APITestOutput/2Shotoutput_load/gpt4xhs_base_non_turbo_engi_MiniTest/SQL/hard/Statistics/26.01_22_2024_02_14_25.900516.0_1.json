For example, salary figures could be presented with different currency symbols or in various numerical formats (like \"388,930\" vs \"388930\").\n\n2. **Duplicate Entries**: Since the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there might be duplicate entries for individuals. It's important to ensure that each individual is only counted once.\n\n3. **Data Size and Scale**: If the dataset is very large, it could be computationally challenging to process it efficiently. This could require optimizing the data parsing algorithm or using more powerful hardware.\n\n4. **Data Integrity**: The dataset could contain errors, missing values or outliers that need to be handled appropriately.\n\n5. **Performance Efficiency**: Depending on the size of the data and the constraints of the system, there may be a need for efficient data structures and algorithms to parse and process the information quickly.\n\n6. **Data Parsing Logic**: The logic to determine if a salary is \"more than 388930\" needs to be accurate, especially with different currencies or if any tax deductions or other adjustments need to be taken into account.\n\n7. **Secondary Data Association**: If the salary information is in a separate row or table from the identifier, there needs to be a reliable way to associate the salary information back to the correct individual.\n\nAddressing these difficulties requires careful planning, accurate data parsing mechanisms, and maybe even some preprocessing of the data before performing the actual count."
