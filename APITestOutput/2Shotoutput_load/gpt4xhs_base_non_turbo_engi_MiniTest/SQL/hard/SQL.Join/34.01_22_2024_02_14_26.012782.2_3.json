Inconsistent Data Formats: If the data related to height or location is not consistently formatted, it may require additional steps to normalize the data before counting.\n\n2. Missing Data: If some entries are missing either the location (CA) or height information, it could affect the accuracy of the count.\n\n3. Data Spanning Multiple Rows: If information about a person spans multiple rows (as indicated by the same primeKey), care must be taken to aggregate this information correctly before applying filters.\n\n4. Duplicate Records: The dataset might contain duplicates, so it's essential to identify and count unique individuals only once.\n\n5. Ambiguities: The abbreviation \"CA\" could potentially stand for California or Canada or any other entity with the same abbreviation. Clarification would be needed to ensure accurate filtering.\n\n6. Variations in Height Measurement: Heights could be recorded in different units (e.g., inches, meters), requiring conversion to a consistent unit for comparison.\n\n7.
