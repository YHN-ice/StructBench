Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Multiple Tables**: If the data is spread across multiple tables, we will need to join them correctly using the primeKey to associate the right height with the person's work location.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Data Formats**: Heights might be provided in different units (feet, meters, inches) or formats that require conversion to compare against a threshold of 172 cm.\n\n3. **Missing Data**: Some records might have missing information for either height or work location, which would need to be handled appropriately.\n\n4. **Data Accuracy**: There could be inaccuracies or typos in the data that could affect the determination of who is taller than 172 cm or who works in IL.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Location Indicator**: \"IL\" should refer to Illinois, but it's important to verify that within the context of the data, there isn't a different meaning attached to \"IL\" that could lead to incorrect inclusion or exclusion of records.\n\n6. **Duplicate Entries**: There may be duplicate rows for some individuals, identified by the same primeKey, which should not be double-counted.\n\n7. **Filtering and Counting Logic**: We need to ensure that the logic for filtering by work location and height is correctly implemented so that only people meeting both criteria are counted.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the dataset is very large, performance considerations may come into play when filtering and counting the records.\n\n9. **Data Type Issues**: Heights and other numerical data may be stored as strings or other types, requiring casting or conversion before comparison can be performed.\n\nOnce we have the input file(s), we must take these potential difficulties into account when parsing and interpreting the data to answer the question accurately."
