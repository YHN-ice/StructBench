The standard format for images in Markdown is `![Alt text](URL/path \"Optional title\")`. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Variations in Markdown Syntax**: There might be slight variations in the Markdown syntax used for images. For instance, the alt text or title could be omitted, or there could be variations in spacing.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths could be relative or absolute, and in some cases, they may even be external URLs. Parsing should account for different path formats.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links, where the URL/path is not directly included in the image syntax but is instead referenced elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions to the standard Markdown syntax, which may introduce non-standard ways to include images.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Images can also be embedded using raw HTML tags within a Markdown file. This would require recognizing HTML `<img>` tags in addition to Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: There might be instances where the image syntax includes escaped characters that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Identifying image files will often rely on common image file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.). However, sometimes images might not have an extension, especially if they are being served dynamically via a script or backend service.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: If there are multiple images on a single line, each one will need to be extracted separately.\n\n9. **Broken Syntax**: In some cases, the syntax for an image might be broken or incomplete, leading to challenges in accurately identifying image files.\n\n10. **Inline Text and Formatting**: Images might be mixed with inline text and other formatting elements, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\nThese challenges may require additional logic to ensure that all image files are accurately identified and extracted from the Markdown content. Once the input file is provided, we can apply relevant parsing strategies to overcome these obstacles and extract the image file names."
