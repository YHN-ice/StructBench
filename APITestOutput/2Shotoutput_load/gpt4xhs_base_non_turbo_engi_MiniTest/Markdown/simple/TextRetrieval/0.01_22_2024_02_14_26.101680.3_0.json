Both **bold text** and __bold text__ are valid. The parser needs to recognize both styles.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements, such as links or italic text. For example: `**This is _italic_ and [link](http://example.com)**`. The parser must extract the bold text while handling the nested elements correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: In Markdown, asterisks or underscores can be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should not treat escaped characters as formatting markers.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes the Markdown may have errors, such as incomplete markers for bold text, like `**bold text`. The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks using backticks (` `) should not be treated as formatted text, even if they contain what looks like bold syntax.\n\n6. **Adjacent Bold Sections**: There could be bold texts placed adjacently with no space between them, like `**bold1****bold2**`. The parser needs to distinguish these as separate bold texts.\n\n7. **False Positives**: There might be sections that appear to be bold due to the presence of double asterisks or underscores but are not meant to be bold, such as bullet points followed by asterisks (`* *Not Bold*`).\n\nConsidering these factors, the parser needs a robust way to identify and extract all correctly formatted bold texts, accounting for the nuances of Markdown syntax and potential markdown authoring errors or edge cases."
