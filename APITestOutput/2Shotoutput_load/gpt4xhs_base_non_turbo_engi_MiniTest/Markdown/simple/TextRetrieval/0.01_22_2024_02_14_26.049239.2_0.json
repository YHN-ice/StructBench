We need to ensure we can recognize all valid syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting nested within it, such as italics, strikethroughs, or links. For example: `**This is _very_ important**`. The parser will need to handle such instances without getting confused by the nested markers.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped to prevent them from being parsed as formatting, like `\\**Not Bold\\**`. The parser should be able to distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks using backticks `` ` `` should not be interpreted as bold, even if it contains asterisks or underscores.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Similar to inline code blocks, text within code blocks (indented by four spaces or a tab) or fenced code blocks (surrounded by triple backticks ``` or tildes ~~~) should not be parsed for formatting.\n\n6. **Partial Overlap with Other Formatting**: Sometimes, bold syntax may partially overlap with other elements like links `[link text](url)`, and care must be taken not to mistakenly interpret these as bold.\n\n7. **Markdown Flavors**: Different Markdown flavors might have slightly different rules for what constitutes bold text, so the parser's rules need to be clear on which flavor is being used.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are also used in lists and for emphasis. The parser needs to differentiate between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n9. **Line Breaks and White Spaces**: The parser should handle white spaces correctly, ensuring that line breaks within bold text don't break the parsing process.\n\n10. **End of Line**: Text formatted as bold at the end of a line might not always be followed by whitespace before the newline character, which needs to be accounted for.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, these considerations can help in ensuring that the parser extracts only the intended bold texts correctly."
