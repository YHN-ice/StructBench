This could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores are used in a non-formatting context and are escaped with a backslash `\\`. I have to make sure not to extract these as bold text.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: There could be cases where the formatting is not applied correctly (e.g., missing a closing asterisk), which could lead to confusion in determining what text is meant to be bold.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (enclosed with triple backticks ```) or inline code (enclosed with single backticks `) should not be formatted, and thus any bold syntax within them should be ignored.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Markdown syntax for links and images could contain asterisks or underscores. These should not be mistaken for bold formatting.\n\n7. **Text Spanning Multiple Lines**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, so a simple line-by-line parsing might miss multi-line bold text.\n\n8. **Whitespace Sensitivity**: Sometimes formatting relies on the correct use of whitespace around the asterisks or underscores, which could affect whether the text is correctly interpreted as bold.\n\nTo correctly extract bold texts, I will need to account for these potential difficulties when processing the Markdown content."
