Not an image(link.jpg)`), which should not be considered as an image file.\n\n7. **File Path Complexity**: Image file paths can be complex and might include directories, subdirectories, or even external URLs. The parser must extract the complete and correct path.\n\n8. **False Positives**: The parser must avoid false positives, such as URLs or other text that may resemble image syntax but are not intended to be images.\n\nNow please provide the input file so I can proceed with extracting the image filenames."
