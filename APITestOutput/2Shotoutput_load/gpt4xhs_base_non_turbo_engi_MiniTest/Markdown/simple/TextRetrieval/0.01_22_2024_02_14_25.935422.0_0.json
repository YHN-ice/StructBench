The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. Both of these need to be handled correctly.\n\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text can be nested within other formatting elements, like links `[**bold text**](URL)`, or italics `**_bold and italic_**`. It's important to extract only the bold portion without including surrounding formatting characters.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being parsed as formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n4. **Incorrectly paired markers:** Some texts may have an opening `**` or `__` without a corresponding closing marker. These should not be considered as bold text.\n\n5. **Inline code blocks and code fences:** Bold markers inside inline code blocks (single backtick `` ` ``) or code fences (triple backticks ``` ``` ```) should not be treated as formatting.\n\n6. **Lists, headers, and other elements:** Bold syntax within lists or headers needs to be correctly identified without including the list markers or header hashes.\n\nConsidering these potential issues, upon receiving the input Markdown file, I would look for correctly paired bold markers (`**` or `__`) while handling the above cases appropriately to extract the raw bold texts accurately."
