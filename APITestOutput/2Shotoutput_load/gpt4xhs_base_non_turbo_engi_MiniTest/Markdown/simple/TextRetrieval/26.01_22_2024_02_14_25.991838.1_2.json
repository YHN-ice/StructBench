The parser needs to handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images can be in various formats like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. The parser must recognize all the common image file extensions.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Image paths in Markdown can be relative to the file location or absolute URLs. The parser should extract the file names or URLs correctly, regardless of the path type.\n\n4. **Complex URLs**: Some image URLs might contain complex characters, parameters, or fragments that could make parsing tricky.\n\n5. **Images within Links**: Sometimes images are nested within links (`[![alt](image)](URL)`), which adds an extra layer of complexity to the parsing.\n\n6. **Incorrect Markdown Syntax**: If the Markdown file contains errors in the image syntax, the parser should be robust enough to either handle or ignore these cases gracefully.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows escaping certain characters. The parser must differentiate between actual image syntax and escaped image-like patterns.\n\n8. **Image Titles and Alt Text**: Titles and alt text for images can contain spaces, special characters, or even parentheses, which can complicate the parsing logic.\n\n9. **Non-image Files**: Ensure that the parser does not confuse image files with other types of file links in Markdown (e.g., links to `.pdf` or `.docx` files).\n\n10. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is very large and contains many images, the parser should perform efficiently without excessive resource consumption.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I would apply a parsing logic that accounts for these potential difficulties to accurately extract the names of all included image files."
