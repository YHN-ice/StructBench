Ambiguous Node Identifiers: If the tree contains nodes with non-unique identifiers or the identifier \"rb\" is used for multiple nodes, it will be challenging to identify which node's depth is being requested.\n\n3. Parsing Errors: The tree file format may be complex or poorly formatted, leading to errors while parsing it.
