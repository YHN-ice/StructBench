Ambiguous notation: In some cases, tree files might have ambiguous or incomplete annotations that complicate the parsing process.\n\n5.

Circular references: If a tree file mistakenly contains circular references (which it should not in a proper tree), it would create an infinite loop while trying to calculate the height.\n\n7.
