The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL_or_path_to_image \"Optional title\")`. However, images can also be embedded using HTML `<img>` tags within the Markdown file.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be linked using relative paths (e.g., `images/picture.jpg`) or absolute paths (e.g., `https://example.com/image.png`). The parser must correctly identify both types.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links, where the image source is not included inline but is defined elsewhere in the document. This may complicate extraction as it requires correlating the reference with its definition.\n\n4. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be nested within other elements, like links or different levels of headers, which adds complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown syntax characters can be escaped to indicate that they should be treated as literal characters (e.g., `\\!` instead of `!` for a non-image \"!\" character).\n\n6. **False Positives**: Text that looks like an image link but isn't (e.g., due to typos, broken syntax, or as a part of code blocks or inline code snippets) should not be mistaken for actual image links.\n\n7. **Capturing Alternate Text**: Extracting just the file names may involve ignoring or separately handling the alternate text and optional title that might be part of the image syntax.\n\n8. **File Name Variations**: Image file names can have various extensions (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser needs to account for these variations.\n\n9. **Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors have their own extensions that could affect how images are embedded.\n\n10. **File Accessibility**: If the Markdown parser is expected to check if the image files actually exist at the given paths (local or remote), this would involve additional verification which may not always be possible or within scope.\n\nGiven these potential issues, care must be taken to robustly extract all image file names while avoiding false positives or missing valid image links."
