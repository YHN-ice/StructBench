If images are linked in different ways (inline, attached, or embedded with different syntax), this may require multiple parsing strategies.\n\n2. **Image link identification**: We need to correctly identify what constitutes an image link within the ORG file. Image files could have various extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., and the parser needs to recognize all possible image formats.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute paths**: Images could be included with relative or absolute paths. The parser needs to extract the filename irrespective of the path type.\n\n4. **Markdown-like syntax**: ORG files may use a markdown-like syntax for images, so the parser must be capable of identifying image syntax within the text.\n\n5. **Text that looks like an image file**: There might be text within the ORG file that resembles an image file name but isn't one (e.g., example text, URLs containing image file extensions, etc.). The parser should distinguish actual image links from such decoys.\n\n6. **Escaped characters or formatting**: Text formatting or escaped characters could interfere with pattern recognition. For instance, if an image filename is split over two lines or includes special characters, it might complicate extraction.\n\n7. **File Encoding and Special Characters**: The encoding of the ORG file could affect how text is read and interpreted, especially if there are non-standard characters in filenames.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the actual parsing logic will need to be robust enough to handle these scenarios. Now, if you provide me with the input ORG file content, I will do my best to parse it and extract any included image filenames."
