The parser must handle all possible markup variations.\n\n2. **Embedded Markup:** Bold text might have other markup embedded within it, such as links, code, italicized text, etc. The parser needs to extract only the bold text while ignoring or appropriately handling the embedded markup.\n\n3. **Multi-line Bold Text:** Bold text might span across multiple lines. The parser should correctly handle this case without breaking the text at line breaks.\n\n4. **False Positives:** Asterisks are also used for creating lists or for emphasizing text other than bold (such as headers). The parser should distinguish between these cases.\n\n5. **Escape Characters:** There might be escaped asterisks or equal signs within the text that are not meant to denote bold text but are part of the content. These should not be confused with actual markup.\n\n6. **Nested Structures:** Bold text can be nested within other structures like lists, quotes, or tables. The parser needs to be aware of these structures and still extract the bold text correctly.\n\n7. **Incomplete Markup:** In case of typos or formatting errors, some bold text might not be properly closed with the corresponding ending markup symbols. The parser might need to decide how to handle such cases.\n\nPlease provide an example ORG file content to proceed with extracting the bold texts."
