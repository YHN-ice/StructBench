Deciding how to handle such content can be challenging.\n\n5. **Nested Structure**: A subsection might contain nested sub-subsections. When providing an excerpt, it may be necessary to decide whether to include these nested structures or only the content up to the beginning of the next sub-subsection.\n\n6. **Incomplete Structures**: If the input file is incomplete or poorly formatted (missing asterisks, inconsistent indentation), it could be challenging to accurately determine the structure of the document.\n\n7. **Large Files**: If the ORG file is particularly large, performance considerations may come into play, as parsing and extracting a specific section may require processing a significant amount of text.\n\n8. **Version Differences**: If ORG mode has undergone significant changes, older or newer features in an ORG file might not be recognized or correctly interpreted by the parser.\n\nWithout seeing the ORG file, these are theoretical obstacles.
