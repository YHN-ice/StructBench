Ensuring the correct hierarchy is important for accurate extraction.\n\n3. **Subsections Handling**: If a section contains subsections, deciding whether to include them in the excerpt can be tricky. Clarification on whether to include only the top-level content of the section or its subsections as well is needed.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: Text encoding can cause problems if it's not handled properly, especially if the ORG file contains special characters or has been encoded in a format different from the system's default.\n\n5. **File Access**: If the ORG file is large or stored remotely, efficient access and reading of the file content can present a challenge. Also, privacy and security considerations may restrict access to the file content.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: The parser should gracefully handle errors such as missing files, corrupted data, or unexpected file formatting.\n\n7. **Performance**: If the ORG file is large, performance can become an issue. The parser should be capable of quickly locating and retrieving the relevant section.\n\nSince I do not have access to external files or databases, I am unable to parse actual files or retrieve their contents.
