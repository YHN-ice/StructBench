JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language and consists of arrays (lists) and objects (key-value pairs), among other data types.\n\nHere are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of identifying the most deeply nested objects:\n\n1. Recursive Structures: JSON can have recursive structures where objects or arrays are nested within themselves to arbitrary depths. Parsing such structures requires careful handling to avoid infinite loops.\n\n2. Ambiguity in Deepest Objects: Determining the \"most deeply nested\" object can be ambiguous if there are multiple objects at the same level of nesting. We would need to clarify whether all objects at the deepest level should be returned or just one example.\n\n3. Large Files: If the JSON file is very large, it may not be practical to manually inspect the entire file to determine the deepest objects. A programmatic approach would be needed.\n\n4. Ensuring Only Objects: The requirement is to identify objects that do not have any list or dict as a value. This means we need to check each object's values to ensure they are only primitives (strings, numbers, etc.) or null.\n\n5. Incorrect JSON Format: If the JSON file has formatting issues or is not valid JSON, parsing tools may fail to read it correctly, making it difficult to find the most deeply nested objects without first correcting the format.\n\n6. Performance Considerations: If the JSON parsing is done programmatically, poorly optimized code could lead to performance issues, particularly with large and complex JSON files.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would typically use a programming language with a JSON parsing library that can handle these complexities. The parser should recursively traverse the JSON structure, keep track of the current depth, and identify objects that have no further nesting (i.e., their values are only primitives or null). It should also be able to handle large files efficiently and deal with any potential JSON format issues."
