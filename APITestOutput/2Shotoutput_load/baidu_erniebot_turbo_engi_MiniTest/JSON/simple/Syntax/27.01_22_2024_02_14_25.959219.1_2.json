Missing or extra commas are a common source of error.\n\n3. **Mismatched Brackets**: Each opening bracket `{` or `[` must have a corresponding closing bracket `}` or `]` respectively.\n\n4. **Improper Quotes**: Keys and string values in JSON must be enclosed in double quotes. Missing quotes or use of single quotes can cause errors.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas**: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in arrays or objects, which is sometimes allowed in JavaScript.\n\n6. **Data Types**: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, boolean, null). Mistakes in value assignments can cause errors.\n\n7. **Unescaped Characters**: Special characters in strings need to be escaped with a backslash. Unescaped characters can cause errors.\n\n8. **Key Duplication**: While not strictly a \"structural\" error, duplicate keys within an object can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nIt is important to systematically check for each of these potential issues to determine whether the JSON file is free from structural errors."
