However, the last key-value pair in an object or the last item in an array should not be followed by a comma.\n\n2. **Quotation Marks**: All keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotation marks (`\"`).\n\n3. **Braces and Brackets**: Each JSON object must start with `{` and end with `}`, and arrays must start with `[` and end with `]`. The opening and closing braces and brackets must be properly matched and nested.\n\n4. **Colon Use**: A colon (`:`) must be used to separate each key from its value.\n\n5. **Data Types**: Values must be of an appropriate data type: string, number, object, array, boolean, or null. Strings must be in double quotes, numbers should not be in quotes, booleans are represented by `true` or `false` without quotes, and null is represented by the keyword `null` without quotes.\n\n6. **Trailing Characters**: There should not be any trailing characters after the closing brace of the JSON object.\n\n7. **Encoding**: The file should be encoded in a valid JSON format, typically UTF-8.\n\nNow, let's examine the JSON file you provide to determine if there are structural errors or not. Please provide the JSON file content to proceed with the assessment."
