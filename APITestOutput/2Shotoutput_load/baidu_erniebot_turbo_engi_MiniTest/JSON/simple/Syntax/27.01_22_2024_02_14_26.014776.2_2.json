If a value is not of an expected type (like a string being used without quotes), that can be an error.\n\n3. **Nested Structures**: Complex JSON with multiple levels of nested objects or arrays might make it harder to spot structural issues.\n\n4. **Size of the JSON**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be challenging to manually inspect it for errors.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: JSON is typically in UTF-8 encoding; if the file is in a different encoding, some characters might not be represented correctly.\n\n6. **Trailing Commas**: Some parsers allow trailing commas, while according to the JSON specification, trailing commas are not allowed.\n\n7. **Lack of Context**: Sometimes, whether something is an error or not might depend on the context or schema expected by the application that uses the JSON.
