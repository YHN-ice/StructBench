        "As you mentioned, parsing a JSON file to find the most deeply nested objects can be challenging. Here's an approach that we can take to tackle this problem:\n\n1. **Parse the JSON file**:\nFirst, we need to parse the JSON file to get an understanding of its structure. This can be done using various JSON parsing libraries in Python, such as `json` module or third-party libraries like `PyYAML` or `jsonschema`.\n2. **Determine depth**:\nOnce the JSON structure is parsed, we need to keep track of the depth while traversing the structure. This can be done using a stack data structure, where each node is pushed onto the stack as it is encountered.\n3. **Identify leaf nodes**:\nOnce the depth is determined, we need to identify the leaf nodes that do not contain any more list or dict types. These are the nodes that we are looking for.\n4. **Extract and output nodes**:\nFinally, we extract the nodes from the JSON file and output them in their original format. To do this, we need to follow these steps:\n\n\n\t* Extract nodes at the top level first, if any\n\t* Extract all nodes in the specified depth level\n\t* Extract nodes in the next depth level and so on until all levels are traversed\n\t* Output the extracted nodes in their original format without losing any information or altering their structure\n5. **Handle cyclic references**:\nIf there are cyclic references in the JSON file, these should be handled gracefully by the parser. For example, if node A refers to node B, which in turn refers to node A, the parser should handle this as an error and output a warning or skip such nodes if desired.\n6. **Large files**:\nIf the JSON file is very large, it might not be practical to process it all at once. In such cases, you might want to consider streaming techniques to process the file efficiently.\n7. **Validating JSON format**:\nTo avoid any parsing errors due to invalid JSON format, it's advisable to validate the JSON structure before parsing it. This can be done using a JSON schema or by using other techniques to validate the structure of the JSON document.\n\nTo summarize, the process of finding the most deeply nested objects in a JSON file involves parsing the file, determining depth, identifying leaf nodes, extracting and outputting them in their original format, and handling any potential issues that may arise during parsing and validation."
