Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. **Format inconsistencies**: If the YAML file does not strictly follow the YAML syntax, it could lead to parsing errors. YAML is sensitive to indentation and requires consistent use of spaces and indentation levels.\n\n2. **Large or complex file structure**: If the file is very large or has a deeply nested structure, it might be challenging to quickly identify the relevant section and extract the needed information.\n\n3. **Multiple documents in one file**: A YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If this is the case, I'll need to know which document contains the `subs` section.\n\n4. **Aliases and anchors**: YAML supports aliases and anchors, which can create references within the document. If the `subs` section uses these features, I will need to resolve them correctly to find the first object's `id`.\n\n5. **Custom tags**: If the YAML file uses custom tags that are defined outside of the standard YAML specification, it could be difficult to interpret these without additional context.\n\n6. **Encoding issues**: If the file has encoding issues or includes non-standard characters, it might cause problems with correctly reading and interpreting the content.\n\n7. **Missing or incorrect key**: If the key for the subs section is misspelled or missing, it would be impossible to locate the correct section without further clarification.\n\nNow that we've outlined potential issues, please provide the YAML file or its relevant excerpt, and I'll do my best to parse it and answer your question about the first object's `id` of `subs`."
