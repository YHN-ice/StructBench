This can make it tricky to identify when an object is the most deeply nested, as it requires checking both keys and values at each level.\n\n3. **References and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of anchors and aliases, which can be used to reference other parts of the document. This could complicate the process of finding the deepest objects as they require resolution of these references.\n\n4. **Implicit vs. Explicit Typing**: YAML can have implicit types based on the value format (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, etc.).

Each document must be parsed separately to identify its most deeply nested objects.\n\n7. **Multiline Strings**: In YAML, strings can span multiple lines, which could make identifying the boundaries of objects more difficult.\n\n8. **Preserving Order**: In some cases, the order of elements may be important, and some parsers may not preserve this order by default.\n\nEach of these obstacles would need to be addressed by the parser to ensure the correct identification of the most deeply nested objects that are not of type list or dict."
