YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is designed to be a human-friendly data serialization standard, and as such, it is generally straightforward to parse. However, there could be several potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Complex Hierarchies**: YAML files can contain complex nested structures. Properly navigating these structures to locate the object with a specific id could be challenging.\n\n2. **Special Characters and Quoting**: Special characters and quoting in YAML can affect how values are interpreted. If the object with id 's' contains such characters, they must be parsed correctly.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) to repeat content. Ensuring that these are resolved properly when looking for the object with id 's' could be tricky.\n\n4. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If the object with id 's' is not in the first document, I would need to parse through multiple documents.\n\n5. **Inheritance and Overrides**: YAML allows for inheritance-like features where a child node can override properties of a parent node. This could complicate locating and determining the final values of the object with id 's'.\n\n6. **Comments**: YAML supports comments, which should be ignored when parsing the file. It’s important to differentiate between actual data and comments.\n\n7. **Data Types**: Properly interpreting the data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, nulls) of the YAML content is necessary for accurate parsing. The YAML parser must handle type conversions correctly.\n\n8. **Version Differences**: Different versions of the YAML specification may have slight differences that could affect parsing. Ensuring compatibility with the version of the YAML being parsed is important.\n\n9. **Schema Validation**: Depending on the context, there might be an expectation for the data to adhere to a certain schema or structure. Validation against such a schema might be required.\n\n10. **Error Handling**: A robust parser should gracefully handle syntax errors or unexpected structures within the YAML file and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nPlease provide the YAML file content so I can assist you further in finding the object with id 's'."
