Understanding and correctly resolving these references is necessary for accurate parsing.\n\n3. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types like scalars (strings, integers, booleans), sequences (arrays/lists), and mappings (hashes/objects). Identifying the type of object with id `w` accurately is important.\n\n4. **Complex Keys or Values**: YAML allows for complex keys, multi-line strings, and explicit data typing which might require careful interpretation.\n\n5. **Handling Tags and Directives**: If the YAML file uses tags (to indicate custom data types) or directives (to specify things like YAML version), they must be properly interpreted as part of the parsing process.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: Detecting and handling errors in the YAML file, such as syntax errors or unexpected token types, is important for producing an accurate parsing result.\n\n7. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some YAML files might include non-standard extensions or application-specific customizations that are beyond the scope of the YAML specification. Being aware of these possible deviations is important.\n\nNow please provide the YAML file content, and I will focus on parsing it to find the object with id `w`."
