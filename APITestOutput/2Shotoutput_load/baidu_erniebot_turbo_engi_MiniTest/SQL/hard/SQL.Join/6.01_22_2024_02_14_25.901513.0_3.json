Care must be taken to not double-count individuals.\n\n5. **PrimeKey Complexity**: If the primeKey is not straightforward to identify or match across different tables, it could complicate the merging of data from different rows that refer to the same person.\n\n6. **Data Size and Performance**: Depending on the size of the datatable, performance issues may arise when handling and processing large amounts of data.\n\n7. **Variability in 'Work Location' Entries**: There might be different abbreviations or spellings for Illinois (IL), such as 'Ill', 'Illinois', or even misspellings, which would complicate filtering by location.\n\n8. **Data Type Discrepancies**: Numeric data such as height may be stored as strings or integers, and this could require type conversion before comparisons can be made.\n\n9. **Sorting and Filtering Logic**: The logic used to filter the set of people by work location and height must be accurately implemented to avoid logic errors that could lead to incorrect results.\n\n10. **Ambiguous Height Measurement**: The question doesn't specify whether 172 is in centimeters or another unit, which might lead to confusion if the datatable doesn't clearly specify units.\n\nOnce we have identified these potential obstacles, we can proceed more efficiently in parsing and analyzing the datatable to answer the question accurately."
