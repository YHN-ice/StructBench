Each command may have different syntax and options.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: The path to figure files can vary greatly. It may be a simple file name, a relative path, or an absolute path. Sometimes, the file extension might be omitted.\n\n3. **File Extension Variability**: LaTeX allows for various image file formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, `.eps`). If the file extension is not specified in the command, it could be challenging to determine the actual file type.\n\n4. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options that modify how the figure is displayed (like scale, width, height, angle). These options need to be parsed correctly to ensure they do not interfere with the extraction of the file name.\n\n5. **Comments and Commented Out Code**: Parts of the LaTeX code could be commented out, including figure inclusion commands. It's important to differentiate between active code and comments.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: A LaTeX document might define custom commands or environments that abstract away the figure inclusion. This may require understanding the definitions of these custom commands.\n\n7. **Environment Wrapping**: Figures may be included inside environments like `figure` or `minipage`, which could affect how the figure inclusion commands are parsed.\n\n8. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: Sometimes, multiple `\\includegraphics` commands might be placed on a single line, separated by other text or commands.\n\n9. **Reuse of File Names**: The same figure file might be included multiple times in a document. Deciding whether to list duplicates or provide unique names could be an issue.\n\n10. **Conditional Inclusion**: Figures may be included conditionally using LaTeX conditionals. This would necessitate parsing the conditionals to know which figures are indeed included in a given context.\n\n11. **Encoding and Special Characters**: The file names may include special characters or use different encodings, which could complicate straightforward text extraction.\n\n12. **Cross-referencing**: Sometimes, the file names for figures are generated or modified using references or commands that compute the file name dynamically.\n\n13. **External Source Inclusion**: The LaTeX document may pull in content from external sources that are not visible"
