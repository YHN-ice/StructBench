If you find a bold text command, extract the bold text and move to the next line.\n4. If you encounter nested bold text commands or custom commands, you can use a recursive pattern matching algorithm to search for the bold text recursively.\n5. If you encounter comments or environments that might affect the extraction of bold texts, you can skip those lines or use a different parsing strategy.\n6. If you encounter incomplete tags or syntax errors, you can skip those lines or handle them appropriately.\n\nAfter you complete the extraction process, you can print the raw texts separated by \\n.\n\nPlease note that this is a general solution and may not work for all LaTeX files.
