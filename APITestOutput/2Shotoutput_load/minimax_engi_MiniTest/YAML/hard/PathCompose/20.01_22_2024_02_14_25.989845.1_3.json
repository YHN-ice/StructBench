Sequences and Mappings: YAML allows both sequences (lists) and mappings (dictionaries or hashes).

Ambiguous Keys: If the YAML file contains keys with the same name at different levels of the hierarchy, it might be unclear which key path to follow without context.\n\n4. Data Types: Making sure that the correct data type is maintained when accessing values. For instance, if a value is expected to be a string but is not quoted in YAML, it could be interpreted as another data type.\n\n5. Anchors and Aliases: YAML supports anchors (&) and aliases (*) which are used to define and reference repeated content.

Indentation: YAML relies on indentation for structure, so incorrect indentation can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n8.
