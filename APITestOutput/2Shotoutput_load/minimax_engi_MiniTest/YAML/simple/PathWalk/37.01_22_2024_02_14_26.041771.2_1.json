Understanding these references might be necessary to provide the correct answer.\n3. **Data Types**: Identifying the correct data type (e.g., string, integer, list, object) for each element is important, especially when similar-looking values can actually be different types (e.g., `123` vs. `'123'`).\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the YAML file is not consistently formatted or has indentation issues, it might be challenging to parse correctly.\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be difficult to efficiently locate the relevant section without a proper querying mechanism.\n6. **Special Characters**: Special characters or reserved indicators in YAML (e.g., `:`, `-`, `!`, `&`, `*`, `|`) must be correctly interpreted according to the context.\n\nOnce I have access to the YAML content, I'll be able to address these issues if they are present and extract the necessary information.
