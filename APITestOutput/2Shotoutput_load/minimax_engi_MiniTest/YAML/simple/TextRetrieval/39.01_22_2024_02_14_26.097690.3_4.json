This can make it difficult to determine the nesting level without resolving these references.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Indentation**: YAML relies on indentation to denote structure. Inconsistent indentation can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n5. **Comments and Directives**: Comments and directives within a YAML file do not affect the data structure but can clutter the view making parsing more challenging.\n\n6. **Multi-document Files**: A single YAML file may contain multiple documents separated by `---`. Parsing must respect document boundaries.\n\n7. **Implicit vs. Explicit Data Types**: YAML's type inference can sometimes make parsing ambiguous without explicit type declarations.\n\nTo give an accurate answer, the parser must be able to navigate these potential difficulties. Once the YAML input file is provided, I'll examine it while keeping these challenges in mind."
