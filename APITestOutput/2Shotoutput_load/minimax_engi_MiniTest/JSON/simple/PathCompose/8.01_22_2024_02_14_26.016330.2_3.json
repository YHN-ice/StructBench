It's important to use the exact key name to access the corresponding value.\n\n3. **Arrays vs Objects**: JSON can contain both arrays (ordered lists) and objects (unordered key-value pairs). The method of accessing values differs between them (using indices for arrays and keys for objects).\n\n4. **Dynamic Data**: If the structure of the JSON data is dynamic and changes frequently, it might be difficult to provide a fixed path to access a value.\n\n5. **Large Size**: For large JSON files, it may be cumbersome to manually trace through the data to find the correct path to \"x\".\n\n6. **Missing or Null Values**: There might be missing keys or null values, which could lead to errors when trying to access a value that doesn't exist.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: The JSON file must be properly encoded (usually UTF-8). Encoding issues can cause problems in reading and parsing the file.\n\n8. **Data Type Confusion**: Values in JSON can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null. It's important to handle each type correctly when accessing and manipulating data.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can take these potential issues into account when determining how to access the value \"x\"."
