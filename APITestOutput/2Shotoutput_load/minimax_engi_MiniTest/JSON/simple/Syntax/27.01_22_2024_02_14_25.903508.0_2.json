Single quotes or unquoted strings are not valid.\n\n3. **Unclosed Brackets**: Objects and arrays need to start with `{` and `[` respectively and close with `}` and `]`. Missing any of these can cause an error.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues**: JSON values can only be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null. If a value does not fit into these types, it's an error.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas**: Unlike some programming languages, trailing commas are not allowed in JSON.\n\n6. **Colon Mistakes**: In a JSON object, key-value pairs must be separated by a colon. Missing or incorrectly placed colons would cause an error.\n\n7. **Nested JSON Objects/Arrays**: Errors might be more difficult to spot within nested structures due to their complexity.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: JSON is typically UTF-8 encoded, so characters that don't match this encoding can cause errors.\n\n9. **Comments**: JSON does not support comments. Any text resembling a comment will be considered a syntax error.\n\n10. **Key Duplication**: While not necessarily a structural error in all parsers, duplicate keys in an object may lead to unexpected behaviour.\n\n11. **File Corruption or Irregular Characters**: Occasionally, files may be corrupted or contain irregular characters that break the JSON structure.\n\n12. **Exceeding Depth Limit**: Very deeply nested JSON objects may exceed parsers' maximum depth limit, although this is not a syntax error per se.\n\n13. **File Size Limit**: Extremely large files may exceed the parser's capabilities or available system resources.\n\nPlease provide the JSON file so that I can check for structural errors according to these common issues."
