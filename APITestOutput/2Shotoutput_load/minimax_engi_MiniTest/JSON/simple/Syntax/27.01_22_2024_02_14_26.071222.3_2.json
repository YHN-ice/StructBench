Some common structural errors in JSON files include:\n\n1. Missing or extra commas: Commas must be used to separate elements in arrays and to separate key-value pairs in objects. A missing comma can cause elements to be incorrectly grouped, while an extra comma can lead to parsing errors.\n\n2. Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and strings: In JSON, keys and strings must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and unquoted keys or strings can cause errors.\n\n3. Improper use of brackets: JSON uses curly braces `{}` for objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays. Brackets must be properly opened and closed to maintain the correct structure.\n\n4. Incorrect data types: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Using an incorrect data type (e.g., an undefined or function) can lead to errors.\n\n5. Trailing commas: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an array or the last key-value pair in an object.\n\n6. Syntax errors: Any deviation from the correct syntax, such as missing quotes, additional symbols, or incorrectly formatted values, can result in errors.\n\nOnce I see the input JSON file, I will be able to determine whether it is free from structural errors or if it contains any of the issues mentioned above."
