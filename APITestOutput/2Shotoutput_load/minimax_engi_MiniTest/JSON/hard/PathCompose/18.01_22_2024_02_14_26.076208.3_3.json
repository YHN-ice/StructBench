Mistaking the data type could lead to incorrect access paths or errors.\n\n5. **Dynamic Structure**: If the structure of the JSON is not known beforehand, or if it changes dynamically, it could be challenging to write a generic access path without first inspecting the structure.\n\n6. **Key Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so 'Key' and 'key' would be considered different.
