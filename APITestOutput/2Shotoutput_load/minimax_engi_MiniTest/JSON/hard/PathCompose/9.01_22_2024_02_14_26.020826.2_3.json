If the data type of a key is assumed incorrectly, accessing its value correctly might be challenging.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive. Care must be taken to use the exact case when specifying keys.\n\n6. **Dynamic or Unknown Structure**: If the JSON structure is dynamic or not known in advance, it can be difficult to write an access path without first inspecting the structure.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: Typos or syntax errors in the path expression (such as missing brackets or incorrect key names) can lead to incorrect access or runtime errors.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it's important to carefully analyze the structure of the JSON file, understand the data types involved, and follow the correct syntax while formulating the path to access the desired value."
