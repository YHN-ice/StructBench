Missing commas, extra commas, or misplaced commas can cause errors.\n\n3. **Unquoted keys or strings**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. If they are not properly quoted, this will result in a structural error.\n\n4. **Trailing commas**: JSON does not allow trailing commas at the end of lists of key-value pairs or array elements.\n\n5. **Mixed data types in arrays**: JSON arrays should contain elements of the same data type.
