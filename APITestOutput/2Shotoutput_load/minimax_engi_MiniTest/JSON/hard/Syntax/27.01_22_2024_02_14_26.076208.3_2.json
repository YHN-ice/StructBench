Missing or extra commas can cause a parsing error.\n\n3. **Improper Key-Value Pair Formatting:** In JSON, key-value pairs within an object should be separated by a colon, and keys must be strings enclosed in double quotes.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues:** JSON recognizes specific data types (string, number, object, array, boolean, null). If the data types aren't correctly used or formatted (like missing quotes around strings), this could lead to errors.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues:** If the JSON file contains characters that are not properly encoded (for example, special characters without proper escaping), it could cause parsing issues.\n\n6. **Comments:** Standard JSON does not support comments.
