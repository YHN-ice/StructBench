Single quotes are not valid, and missing quotes can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Syntax Errors**: JSON has a strict syntax, and any deviation from the standard format, such as trailing commas or comments, can result in parsing errors.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types. Anomalies like using an unsupported data type or incorrect representation of data (e.g., unquoted numbers) can cause issues.\n\n5. **Nested Structures**: Errors could occur in nested objects or arrays if they are not properly opened and closed with curly braces `{}` for objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: JSON files should be encoded in UTF-8 without a Byte Order Mark (BOM). Encoding issues can lead to parsing failures.\n\n7. **Unescaped Characters**: Special characters like backslashes, double quotes inside strings, etc., need to be properly escaped; otherwise, they could lead to errors.\n\n8. **Invalid Key-Value Pairs**: Every key-value pair should have a key string followed by a colon and then the value. Any deviation from this pattern results in a structural error.\n\nOnce I have the input file, I'll analyze it for these issues and determine if there are any structural errors."
