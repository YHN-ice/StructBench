Large or Complex JSON Structure: A JSON file with a complex or extensive structure may make it harder to quickly parse and determine the depth of each object.\n\n2. Recursive or Nested Objects: If the JSON contains recursive structures or objects nested within objects, it can be challenging to programmatically identify the deepest level without a well-defined algorithm.\n\n3. Identifying Leaf Nodes: In the context of JSON, the most deeply nested objects would be considered the \"leaf nodes\" in a tree structure, which have no further nested objects or lists as values. Determining these requires traversing the entire JSON structure.\n\n4. Handling Multiple Data Types: JSON supports various data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. The parser must handle these appropriately when identifying nested structures.\n\n5. Ambiguity in Definition: The definition of \"deeply nested\" might be subject to interpretation. For instance, whether an object nested within a list should be considered as deeply nested as one within another object.\n\n6. Performance: For very large JSON files, the performance of the parser could become an issue, thus requiring efficient algorithms for traversal and depth calculation.\n\n7. Output Format: When presenting the deepest nested objects, they must be displayed in the format requested (excerpts separated by new lines), which requires careful string manipulation and formatting.\n\nOnce we have a look at the actual JSON input file, we'll need to keep these potential difficulties in mind while parsing the file and identifying the most deeply nested objects."
