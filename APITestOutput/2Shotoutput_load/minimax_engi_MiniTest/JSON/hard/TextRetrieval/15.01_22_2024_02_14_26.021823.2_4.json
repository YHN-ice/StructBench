Identifying the most deeply nested objects requires traversing through these structures appropriately.\n\n2. **Differentiation between objects and arrays**: JSON allows both objects (dicts in Python) and arrays (lists in Python). It's necessary to distinguish between these types as arrays can also contain objects, but you're looking for the most deeply nested objects where no values are of type list or dict.\n\n3. **Handling multiple occurrences**: There might be multiple deeply nested objects at the same level of nesting. It's important to identify all such occurrences.\n\n4. **Inconsistent data types**: Values within nested objects might vary in data types. Parsing logic should be able to handle different types like strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, etc.\n\n5. **Large JSON files**: If the JSON file is large, it could be challenging to process it efficiently without running into memory or performance issues.\n\n6. **Properly formatting the output**: Ensuring that the extracted nested objects are presented as they appear in the JSON file, including maintaining the original formatting such as indentation, key order, etc.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in task definition**: The term \"most deeply nested\" may need clarification. It could be interpreted as the object with the greatest depth of nesting, regardless of whether it contains other objects or arrays, or it could be interpreted as an object that does not contain any other objects or arrays within it.\n\n8. **Variations in input structure**: JSON files may not have a consistent structure throughout, which means that a parser must be adaptable to variations in the types and structures of nested entities.\n\nGiven these challenges, one would typically write a recursive function to traverse the JSON structure, keeping track of the current depth and the current \"deepest\" object found that meets the criteria of having no list or dict values. Once the traversal is complete, the function would return this deepest object or objects."
