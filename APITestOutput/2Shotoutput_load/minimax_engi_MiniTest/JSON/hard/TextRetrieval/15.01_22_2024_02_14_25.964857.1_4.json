This could lead to performance issues if not handled correctly.\n\n3. **Ambiguous Definitions**: The definition of \"most deeply nested objects\" might be ambiguous. For instance, does a nested object within an array count? Is it only the depth that matters, or also the number of properties?\n\n4. **Identifying Non-List/Dict Values**: We need to distinguish between different types of values (e.g., list, dict, string, number, boolean) and ensure that we only consider objects where no value is a list or dict.\n\n5. **Multiple Occurrences**: There might be multiple objects that are equally deeply nested. The challenge is to find all such occurrences and not just the first one encountered.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a systematic approach to traverse the JSON structure will be required, potentially using recursive functions or a stack to keep track of the nesting levels. Once a most deeply nested object is found, it needs to be extracted in the format as it appears in the JSON file. If efficiency becomes a concern for large files, stream processing techniques might need to be employed.\n\nIn order to provide an accurate answer, I would need to see the actual JSON content to parse it accordingly."
