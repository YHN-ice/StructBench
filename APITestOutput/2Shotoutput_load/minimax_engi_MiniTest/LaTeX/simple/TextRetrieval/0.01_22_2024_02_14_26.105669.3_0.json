The parser must be able to recognize all of these.\n\n2. Nested Commands: Bold text might be nested inside other commands or environments, which can make parsing more complex. For example, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{bold} text}` has emphasized text nested within bold text.\n\n3. Custom Macros: A LaTeX document may define custom macros that result in bold text, which the parser may not recognize without additional information about the macro definitions.\n\n4. Comments: Bold commands within comments should not be considered as they are not rendered. LaTeX comments start with `%`.\n\n5. Scopes and Environments: Bold formatting could be applied over entire environments or scopes, such as within a `{\\bfseries ...}` block. The parser needs to handle these broader applications correctly.\n\n6. Incomplete or Broken Commands: If the LaTeX file contains incomplete or erroneous commands (e.g., `\\textbf{Bold text without closing brace`), it can make parsing for bold text difficult.\n\n7. Multiple Bold Sections on One Line: There could be multiple instances of bold text on a single line, which should all be extracted separately.\n\nThe parser should be designed to handle these situations and carefully extract the raw bold texts as required."
