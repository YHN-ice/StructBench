Recognizing and handling such custom commands would be necessary to extract bold texts correctly.\n\n4. **Comments and inactive code:** Text within comments (after `%`) or within inactive code blocks should not be treated as part of the document content.\n\n5. **Environment-based formatting:** The bold text might be applied through an environment (like `{\\bfseries ...}`) rather than a direct command. Identifying these environments where bold formatting is implied could be essential.\n\n6. **Broken formatting:** Incomplete or misused formatting commands might lead to difficulty in determining which text is meant to be bold.\n\n7. **Command variations:** The syntax for bold text might vary slightly depending on the LaTeX packages used, or due to user-defined macros that change default behaviors.\n\nNow, please provide the LaTeX input file content so that I can proceed to extract the bold texts for you."
