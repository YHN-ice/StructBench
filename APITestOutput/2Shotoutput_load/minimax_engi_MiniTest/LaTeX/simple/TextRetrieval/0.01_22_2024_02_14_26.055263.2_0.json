In LaTeX, this is often done with the `\\textbf{}` command or inside a `\\bfseries` declaration. Here are a few potential challenges in extracting bold text:\n\n1. **Multiple Commands**: Bold text in LaTeX can be specified with different commands (`\\textbf{}`, `\\bfseries`, etc.), and we need to identify all the possible variations.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: LaTeX allows for commands to be nested within one another. A bold command could contain other formatting commands or environments, making extraction more complex.\n\n3. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to delimit the argument of the `\\textbf{}` command. Properly parsing the text means correctly matching opening and closing braces, even when nested.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Special characters in LaTeX (like `%`, `$`, `\\`, `{`, `}`, etc.) could be present within the bold text, requiring correct handling to avoid misinterpretation during parsing.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Bold text could span multiple lines or contain significant whitespace that needs to be preserved in the output.\n\n6. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` character. Any bold text within comments should not be extracted as it is not intended for output.\n\n7. **Custom Commands**: The document might define custom commands for boldfacing text, so without knowledge of these, some bold text might be missed.\n\nTo extract the bold text correctly, the parser must handle all these situations appropriately. If you provide me with a LaTeX input file, I can attempt to extract the bold texts considering the above challenges."
