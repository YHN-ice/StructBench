Sometimes paths are relative, and there might be LaTeX commands that set a default path which won't be visible in the `\\includegraphics` command itself.\n\n3. **File extensions:** Not every LaTeX command that includes figures will specify the file extension, because LaTeX can automatically determine the correct graphic file to use based on its settings and the files present in the compilation directory.\n\n4. **Figure environments:** Figures can be included within different environments, like `figure`, `minipage`, etc., which might complicate the pattern matching for figure file names.\n\n5. **Comments and non-standard use:** The file name could be commented out, or the commands could be wrapped in new commands defined by the user, which would not be recognized without parsing those new commands as well.\n\n6. **Optional arguments:** The `\\includegraphics` command and similar commands often include optional arguments that can change the way figures are handled, and these might appear before the actual file name.\n\n7. **Concatenated filenames:** In some LaTeX files, filenames are constructed dynamically using concatenation of tokens or commands.
