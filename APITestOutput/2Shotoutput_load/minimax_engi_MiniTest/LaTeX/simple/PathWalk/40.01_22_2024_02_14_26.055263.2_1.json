Additionally, there may be conditionally included content based on certain LaTeX commands or packages that may or may not be part of the final content.\n\n4. **Complex commands and environments**: LaTeX files can contain complex commands and environments (like `equation`, `figure`, `table`, etc.) that might need special handling to extract just the textual content.\n\n5. **Custom commands and macros**: The file might define custom commands or macros which change how content should be parsed and displayed.\n\n6. **Cross-referencing labels**: There might be labels used for cross-referencing within the document.
