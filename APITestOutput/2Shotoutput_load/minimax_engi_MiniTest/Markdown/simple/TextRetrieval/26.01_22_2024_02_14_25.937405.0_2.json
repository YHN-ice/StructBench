Different Markdown Syntax: Markdown allows images to be included using different syntaxes, such as `![Alt text](URL)` or referenced style like `![Alt text][id]` where `id` is a reference to a URL defined elsewhere in the document. The parser must handle all these variations.\n\n2. Relative vs. Absolute Paths: Image paths can be relative to the file location or absolute URLs. Distinguishing between the two might be necessary depending on the requirements.\n\n3. Inline HTML: Markdown also allows for inline HTML. Images may be embedded using `<img>` tags and these should be recognized by the parser.\n\n4. Image Links without Display: An image link might be present but commented out or not displayed due to incorrect syntax or being part of a code block or inline code. The parser needs to differentiate between displayable images and non-displayed links.\n\n5. Multiple Images on the Same Line: Sometimes multiple images might be included on the same line, so the parser will need to correctly identify and extract each one.\n\n6. Alternative Text Variations: The alt text for images might contain special characters, parentheses, brackets, etc., which could complicate regex-based extraction methods.\n\n7. Nested Markdown: If Markdown is nested within other elements, such as lists or blockquotes, it may affect how image links are parsed.\n\n8. Non-image File Links: Ensuring that the extracted files are actually images and not links to other file types (like PDFs or documents) that happen to use similar syntax.\n\n9. Escaped Characters: Markdown allows characters to be escaped, which means an image syntax might be present but escaped to prevent its rendering as an image.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, a robust parser will need to account for various Markdown use cases and edge cases to accurately extract all image file names."
