Using double underscores `__` before and after the text: `__bold text__`\n\nHere are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Nested Elements**: Bold text in Markdown could have other formatting elements nested inside it, such as links, images, or italic text. We need to ensure that these nested elements are handled correctly while still extracting the bold text.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are used in the text but are escaped with a backslash `\\` should not be interpreted as formatting characters. For example, `**bold \\**escaped\\** text**` should be extracted as \"bold **escaped** text\" without the asterisks meant as literal asterisks.\n\n3. **Incomplete Formatting**: Sometimes, formatting may be incorrectly applied or incomplete, such as mismatched or unbalanced asterisks or underscores. These cases could lead to ambiguity about what text is intended to be bold.\n\n4. **Code Blocks**: Text enclosed within code blocks using backticks ``` or indented with four spaces should not be parsed for formatting, as they are meant to display raw text. Bold syntax within these blocks should be ignored.\n\n5. **Different Markdown Flavors**: There are different flavors of Markdown (e.g., GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and each may have slight variations in how bold text is handled. We must understand which flavor of Markdown we are parsing.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Depending on the parser used or the flavor of Markdown, line breaks can either break formatting or be ignored. The rules around line breaks and how they interact with bold formatting need to be considered.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the parser needs to be robust enough to interpret the input file accurately and extract all texts that are meant to be bold according to the specific rules of the Markdown flavor being used."
