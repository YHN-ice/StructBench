Ensuring that the parser can handle all these cases is crucial.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image sources can be specified with either relative or absolute paths. Relative paths might require additional context to resolve to actual file locations.\n\n3. **Image URLs**: Some images may not be files included in the Markdown document itself but are instead URLs pointing to images hosted online. We would need to decide whether these also count as 'included image files'.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs or File Names**: Some image paths may include URL encoding or special characters that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n5. **Markdown Links Mistaken for Images**: A common mistake might be to misinterpret links that are formatted similarly to images but are not images (e.g., `[Link Text](URL)` instead of `![Alt text](URL)`).\n\n6. **Variants in Markdown Flavors**: Different flavors of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.) might have subtle differences in how images are included.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, the image syntax might be escaped to prevent it from being rendered as an image, which should ideally be detected and handled properly.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be nested inside other elements, like lists or blockquotes, which could potentially complicate parsing.\n\nEach of these potential issues would need to be addressed by the parser in order to correctly identify and extract all image file names from a given Markdown input file."
