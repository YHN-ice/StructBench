It's important to recognize both formats.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might have nested elements like links `[link](URL)`, italics, or even code spans. Extracting just the bold text without the markdown syntax for these nested elements can be tricky.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used in the text might be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being parsed as Markdown syntax, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There could be false positives where asterisks or underscores are not used for bold text but for other purposes (e.g., bullet lists, horizontal rules, or just part of the regular text).\n\n5. **Incomplete Pairs**: Sometimes, a pair of asterisks or underscores might be incomplete, leading to incorrect extraction if not handled properly.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown supports bold text that spans multiple lines. This can complicate the parsing as it requires detecting the end of the bold syntax across line breaks.\n\n7. **Adjacent Bold Sections**: There could be cases where bold sections are adjacent to each other separated by whitespace or punctuation which needs to be handled carefully.\n\nEach of these issues requires specific handling in the parsing algorithm to ensure accurate extraction of all bold texts from the Markdown file."
