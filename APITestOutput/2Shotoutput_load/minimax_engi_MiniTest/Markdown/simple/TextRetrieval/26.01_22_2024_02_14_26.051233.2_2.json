They may include various file extensions such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.\n\n3. **Capturing Alt Text vs. File Names:** Ensuring that we capture the file name or URL and not the alternative text which describes the image.\n\n4. **Handling Inline HTML:** Sometimes, images can be embedded using HTML tags within Markdown files like `<img src=\"image-path\" alt=\"Alt text\">`.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters:** There may be escaped characters that should not be included as part of the actual file path.\n\n6. **Links vs. Images:** Distinguishing between markdown links to web pages and links to image files, as they have similar syntax.\n\n7. **File Path with Spaces:** Handling file paths with spaces which may be included within angle brackets or quotes.\n\n8. **File Names with Special Characters:** File names may include special characters that could affect the parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown Elements:** Handling potential nested elements within image tags (though not commonly supported, some implementations might handle it).\n\n10. **Error Handling:** Dealing with malformed Markdown syntax or incomplete image tags that do not follow the standard conventions.\n\nOnce we've addressed these potential difficulties, we'll be ready to parse the Markdown content and extract the image file names accurately.
