The two primary ones are inline style `![alt text](image_path)` and reference style `![alt text][image_ref]` with the reference defined elsewhere in the document. We need to handle both.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths:** Image paths can be relative or absolute URLs. It's necessary to identify and extract both types correctly.\n\n3. **Image file extensions:** Common image file extensions include `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, and more. We need to ensure we recognize all possible image formats.\n\n4. **Alt text confusion:** The alt text for images might contain parentheses or brackets, which could confuse a simple parser if it does not correctly handle such cases.\n\n5. **Links vs. images:** In Markdown, the syntax for links and images is very similar, with images having an exclamation mark prefix (`!`). We must differentiate between the two.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown elements:** Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **Escaped characters:** Sometimes, the image syntax could include escaped characters that a simple parser might misinterpret.\n\n8. **Invalid Markdown:** If the document contains invalid Markdown syntax, it could lead to incorrect extraction or missing image file names.\n\n9. **Duplicated references:** If the same reference style image is used multiple times, we need to ensure we don't duplicate file names in the output.\n\nPreparing to handle these issues will help create a more robust solution for parsing and extracting image files from a Markdown document."
