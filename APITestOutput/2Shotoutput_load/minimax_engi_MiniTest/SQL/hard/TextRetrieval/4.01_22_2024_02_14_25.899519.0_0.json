Inconsistent Data: If there are multiple rows with primeKey 'c' that contain conflicting information, it will be challenging to ascertain the correct status.\n\n3. Data Format: The status information could be stored in a non-standard format, requiring transformation or interpretation before it can be understood.\n\n4. Large Dataset: If the datatable is very large, locating the specific record with primeKey 'c' may be time-consuming without proper indexing or search functionality.\n\n5. Ambiguous Definitions: If the term \"status\" is not clearly defined within the context of the datatable, it may be unclear what kind of information is being requested.\n\n6. Access Restrictions: There might be permission or access level restrictions that prevent viewing or parsing certain parts of the datatable.\n\n7. Corrupted Data: The datatable could have corrupted data entries which might lead to incorrect or incomplete parsing of the required information.\n\nNow that we've anticipated potential issues, please provide the datatable so we can attempt to extract the status of the record with primeKey 'c'."
