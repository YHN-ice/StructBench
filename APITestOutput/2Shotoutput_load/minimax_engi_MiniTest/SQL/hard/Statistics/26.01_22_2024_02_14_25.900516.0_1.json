There may be complexities such as salary data spread across multiple columns or rows, requiring more intricate parsing logic.\n\n6. **Data Access and Privacy**: The data might contain sensitive information which could raise privacy concerns or access restrictions.\n\n7. **Missing Data**: There might be missing or incomplete salary information for some entries, making it unclear whether those people meet the salary criteria.\n\n8. **Prime Key Clarity**: If the primeKey is not clearly defined or there are duplicate entries without a primeKey, it could be difficult to ensure that all entries for the same person are correctly identified and aggregated.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties requires careful planning and robust data parsing and validation strategies.
