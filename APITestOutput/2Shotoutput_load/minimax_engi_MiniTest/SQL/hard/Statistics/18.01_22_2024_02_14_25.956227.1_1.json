It would be important to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n4. **Data Size**: If the datatable is very large, the processing time could be a concern and would potentially require efficient parsing methods or tools.\n\n5. **Data Type Mismatch**: Salaries need to be treated as numerical values for comparison. If they are not in a numerical format, they would need to be cast or converted.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structure**: The datatable could have a complex structure that might not be straightforward to parse, such as nested tables or non-tabular data that needs additional processing.\n\n7. **Multiple Data Sources**: If salary information is spread across multiple files or sources, it may require aggregating data before the analysis.\n\n8. **PrimeKey Association**: Ensuring that the primeKey is correctly used to identify unique individuals so that their salaries are not counted multiple times.\n\n9. **Data Accessibility**: The data table needs to be in a readable and accessible format for parsing.\n\n10. **Ambiguity in Salary Representation**: There could be ambiguity regarding what constitutes 'salary' in the data (e.g., base salary vs. total compensation including bonuses).\n\nOnce the datatable is presented, I would process it while considering these potential challenges."
