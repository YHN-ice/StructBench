It would be important to handle these cases correctly.\n\n6. **Inline Images**: Images might be inserted inline with text, which can make it harder to parse them out without catching surrounding text.\n\n7. **Embedded Base64 Images**: If images are embedded in Base64 encoding directly in the ORG file, these will not typically have file names and thus may not fit the criteria for extraction but should be considered if raw image data extraction is required.\n\n8. **Comments and Visibility Settings**: Parts of the ORG file might be commented out or set to be invisible, which means they should possibly be ignored by the parser.\n\n9. **Encoding and Character Sets**: The file might use different encodings, which could affect how text is interpreted, especially for paths with non-standard characters.\n\n10. **Linked Sub-files**: An ORG file may link to other files which themselves contain images; deciding whether or not to follow these links is an additional complexity.\n\nGiven these potential issues, please provide the ORG file content to proceed with extracting the image file names."
