For example, links could be enclosed in square brackets or not, and they may include descriptive text alongside the actual link.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images might be linked with absolute or relative paths. A robust parser needs to extract the file name irrespective of the path type.\n\n3. **Embedded vs Attached Images**: Images can be directly embedded in the ORG file or simply linked. The parser should differentiate between embedded image data and linked image files.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: Not all images will have standard '.jpg' or '.png' extensions. There could be other extensions like '.gif', '.svg', or even non-standard extensions, and the parser should recognize all valid image formats.\n\n5. **Non-image Links**: An ORG file could contain links to non-image files or URLs. The parser should only extract links to image files and not get confused with other types of links.\n\n6. **Markup and Comments**: The ORG file might include comments or additional markup that could obscure the links. The parser should be able to ignore these non-relevant parts.\n\n7. **Multiple Links on One Line**: There might be multiple links on a single line, and the parser needs to identify and extract each one individually.\n\n8. **Special Characters**: File names could include special characters or spaces that need to be handled correctly.\n\n9. **Link Text**: If the link includes descriptive text, the parser should ignore this text and only extract the actual file name.\n\nBy considering these potential difficulties beforehand, you can build a more robust and accurate parsing strategy.
