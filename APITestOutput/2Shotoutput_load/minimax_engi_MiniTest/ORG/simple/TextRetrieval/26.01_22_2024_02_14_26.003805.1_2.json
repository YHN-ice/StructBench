However, several potential difficulties and obstacles may arise:\n\n1. **Variety of Link Formats**: Image files in ORG files can be linked using different formats or protocols (like file links, HTTP URLs, etc.). It's necessary to recognize all the possible formats.\n\n2. **File Extensions**: The parser must correctly identify what constitutes an image file extension. Common image extensions include .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, etc.\n\n3. **Inline Images vs. Linked Images**: Some images might be displayed inline within the ORG document, while others might just be linked. The parser needs to differentiate and extract both types.\n\n4. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Occasionally, images can be embedded directly in the file in Base64 encoding. These would not have traditional file names but could be considered included image content.\n\n5. **Link Text vs. URL**: Sometimes, the link text might resemble a file name or even contain an image extension. The parser must distinguish between the display text and the actual URL or path to the image file.\n\n6. **Comments and Archived Content**: Images might be referenced in comments or in archived sections of the ORG document. Depending on the requirements, these may or may not be considered as 'included' images.\n\n7. **Encoded File Paths**: File paths might be URL-encoded or contain special characters that need to be interpreted or decoded properly to extract the correct file name.\n\n8. **Variety of Markup Styles**: ORG files support different markup styles for embedding images, so the parser must handle all possible variations.\n\n9. **Cross-Platform Path Differences**: File paths can differ between operating systems (like forward slashes vs. back slashes), which might affect how file names are extracted.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in writing a parser that accurately extracts all included image files from an ORG file.
