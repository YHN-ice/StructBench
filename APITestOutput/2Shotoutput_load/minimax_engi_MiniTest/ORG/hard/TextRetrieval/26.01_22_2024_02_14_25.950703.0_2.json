Identifying all the possible formats used to include images is necessary for complete extraction.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be included using absolute paths, relative paths, or even URLs. The parser needs to distinguish between these and correctly identify image file names in each case.\n\n3. **Embedded Images**: Images can be embedded within the content in a way that is not straightforward to extract, such as being encoded in base64 or included inline within other non-image content.\n\n4. **Image File Extensions**: Recognizing which files are images based on their extensions requires knowledge of various image file types (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and handling potential edge cases or unusual extensions.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Filenames that include special or escaped characters might not be parsed correctly if the parser doesn't handle these cases properly.\n\n6. **External References**: Images might not actually be present in the file but rather linked to external sources. The parser must decide whether to include these as 'image files' or not.\n\n7. **Non-standard Syntax**: If the ORG file uses non-standard or custom syntax for including images, the parser might need additional logic to handle these cases.\n\n8. **File Hierarchy**: If the ORG file references images in a directory structure, the parser must resolve the paths correctly, taking into account the location of the ORG file itself.\n\n9. **Comments and False Positives**: The parser might encounter links to images within comments or other non-relevant sections, leading to false positives that aren't actually meant to be image file references.\n\n10. **Performance Issues**: If the ORG file is very large with many images, performance could become an issue, and the parser may need to be optimized for efficiency.\n\nTo address these potential difficulties, we would need to ensure that the parser has a robust set of rules and patterns to correctly identify and extract image file names from the ORG file content."
