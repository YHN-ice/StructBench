        "It seems that there was an issue with receiving the input file. However, I can still provide you with a general approach to parsing an ORG file and extracting bold texts. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Read the File**: First, you need to read the content of the ORG file. You can use a file reading function in your programming language to do this.\n\n2. **Tokenize the Text**: Split the text into individual tokens, such as words, punctuation, and formatting elements. This can be done using regular expressions or a tokenizer library.\n\n3. **Identify Bold Text**: Look for tokens that indicate the start and end of bold text. In ORG files, this is usually denoted by asterisks (`*`). Keep track of the start and end positions of the bold text.\n\n4. **Extract Bold Text**: Once you have identified the start and end positions of the bold text, extract the text between these positions. This can be done by slicing the original text string using the start and end positions.\n\n5. **Handle Nested Formatting**: If bold text is nested within other formatting elements, you need to adjust the start and end positions accordingly. For example, if bold text is within an italicized section, you should only consider the asterisks that are part of the bold text and not the ones used for italicization.\n\n6. **Remove Extraneous Characters**: After extracting the bold text, you may need to remove any extra characters, such as asterisks or spaces, that were part of the formatting but not the actual text.\n\n7. **Reassemble the Text**: Finally, reassemble the text by inserting the extracted bold text back into the original text at the appropriate positions.\n\nThis is a general approach to parsing an ORG file and extracting bold text. The specific implementation may vary depending on the programming language and libraries you are using.
