Inconsistent Data Formats: The height data might be stored in different units or formats, such as centimeters, meters, feet, or inches. This would require standardization to accurately compare the heights.\n\n3. Multiple Rows per Person: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we must ensure that we don't count the same person more than once if their data is spread across multiple rows.\n\n4. Data Accuracy: The data provided might contain errors or inaccuracies that could lead to incorrect counts.\n\n5. Filtering by Location and Height: We will need to filter the datatable first by the location (CA) and then by the height criterion (>177). This will involve conditions and potentially complex queries, depending on how the data is structured.\n\n6. PrimeKey Identification: Ensuring that the primeKey is correctly used to identify individuals uniquely and not mistakenly counting different people with similar characteristics.\n\n7. Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, parsing it efficiently without performance issues might be a challenge.\n\n8. Irrelevant Columns: The datatable may contain numerous columns that are irrelevant to the query, which could slow down processing if not handled correctly.\n\nOnce we have the datatable and understand its structure and content, we can devise a strategy to overcome these potential obstacles and accurately determine the number of people who meet the criteria."
