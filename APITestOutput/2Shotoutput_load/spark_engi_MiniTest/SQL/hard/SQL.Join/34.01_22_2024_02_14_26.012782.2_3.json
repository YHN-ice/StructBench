Data Format Consistency: The data might not be consistently formatted. For example, height could be recorded in different units (such as inches or meters) or in various formats (such as \"180cm\" or \"1.80m\"). This would require standardization to make meaningful comparisons.\n\n2. Multiple Entries: Individuals may have multiple entries with the same primeKey. Ensuring no duplicates are counted is crucial to getting an accurate count.\n\n3. Missing Data: There may be incomplete entries where the height or work location is not specified. This would require a decision on how to handle missing data.\n\n4. Data Spread Across Tables: If the data is spread across multiple tables, it will need to be joined using the primeKey to get complete information about individuals.\n\n5. Inconsistent Location Representation: The work location may be represented in various forms, such as \"CA,\" \"California,\" or using ZIP codes. We would need to identify all entries that represent California.\n\n6. Data Errors and Outliers: The dataset may contain errors or outliers, such as incorrect heights or locations, and these would need to be identified and handled.\n\n7. Data Parsing and Extraction: Depending on the file format (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.), appropriate parsing and extraction methods have to be used to access the data.\n\nOnce you provide the input file or data, we can proceed with addressing these potential difficulties to arrive at an accurate answer."
