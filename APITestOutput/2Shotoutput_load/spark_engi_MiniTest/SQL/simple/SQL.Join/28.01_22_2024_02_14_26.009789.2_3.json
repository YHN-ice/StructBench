The dataset provided contains information on people's names, ages, heights, weights, colors, genders, employment status, salary, company, location, and status.\n\nTo determine the number of females in the dataset, we need to look at the 'gender' column. According to the data in this column, there are 5 females ('female', 'Female', 'FEMALE', 'female', 'female').\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to count the number of females in the dataset:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')\n\n# Count the number of females\ncount = df['gender'].value_counts()['female']\n\nprint(f'The number of females in the dataset is: {count}')\n```\n\nThis code first loads the dataset using pandas' read_csv function. It then uses the value_counts function to count the number of occurrences of each unique value in the 'gender' column. The resulting Series object is indexed by the unique values in the 'gender' column, so we can access the count of female entries by indexing it with 'female'. The final line prints out the count.The gender of the record with primeKey 'e' is 'Female'.It seems that the color of the record with primeKey 'g' is not specified in the given tables. Therefore, we cannot determine the color for this particular record.The gender of the record with primeKey c is male.female0The number of people who work in CA and are taller than 175 is 0. 1"
