We need to know all the possible ways images can be embedded to accurately extract them.\n\n2. **File Path Formats**: The path to the image files could be relative or absolute, and it might include various directory separators depending on the operating system that was used to create the document.\n\n3. **Link Embedding**: Images might not only be included directly but also could be embedded within links. We would have to parse links as well to find any embedded image files.\n\n4. **Image File Extensions**: There are several image file formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.), and we need to ensure we recognize and extract all possible image file types.\n\n5. **Inline Images vs Attached Images**: Images can be included in-line within the text or attached at specific headers or sections. The parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n6. **Non-image Files**: The parser must differentiate between image files and other types of files that could also be included in the ORG file, such as documents or source code files.\n\n7. **Commented or Inactive Links**: There might be commented-out lines or inactive links that include image paths which should not be considered as active images in the document.\n\n8. **Encoded Image Data**: Sometimes, images might be included as encoded data (like base64) instead of file paths. Identifying these cases could be more challenging.\n\nTo proceed correctly, the parser must be able to tackle these potential challenges efficiently. Now, if you provide the input ORG file content, I can attempt to extract all included image file names for you."
