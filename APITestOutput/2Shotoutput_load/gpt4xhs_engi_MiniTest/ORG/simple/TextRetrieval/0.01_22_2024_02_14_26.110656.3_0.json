Identifying the correct pattern is crucial.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italic, underlined, or code blocks.

A parser must distinguish between these uses and bold formatting.\n\n6. **Contextual Understanding**: Understanding the context in which the bold text appears might be necessary if there are ambiguities in formatting that a simple text-based parser might not catch.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser needs to have a robust pattern recognition system that can correctly identify bold text within the various contexts and formatting complexities of an ORG file.
