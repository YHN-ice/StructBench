Bold text is typically denoted by surrounding the text with asterisks, e.g., `*bold*`. However, the precise syntax can vary and may involve multiple asterisks or other markers.\n\n2. **False Positives**: Asterisks might be used in the file for purposes other than bolding text, such as bullet points or to denote emphasis (which often uses slashes like `/emphasis/`). It's important to distinguish these from actual bold formatting to avoid false positives.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might also have other formatting applied to it, such as italic, underline, or code formatting. It's important to parse these correctly and still identify that the primary style is bold.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Lines**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser must correctly identify and handle these instances.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Some asterisks may be escaped to display them as literal characters rather than as formatting markers. The parser needs to be aware of escape sequences and handle them properly to not misinterpret them as bold markers.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: There may be instances where the bold formatting is started but not properly ended within the file. The parser must decide how to handle such cases.\n\nOnce you provide the input file, I'll be able to extract and provide the bold texts based on the specific syntax used within that file."
