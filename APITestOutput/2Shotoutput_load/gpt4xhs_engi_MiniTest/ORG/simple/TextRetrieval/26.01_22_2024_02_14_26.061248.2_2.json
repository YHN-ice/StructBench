The syntax for including images might have variations, such as different ways to link to a file or using different keywords for embedding images.\n\n2. **File path variations**: Images can be linked using absolute or relative paths. Handling different path structures, especially if they involve directory traversals (like `../image.png`), could be challenging.\n\n3. **Markup complexity**: An ORG file can contain nested structures, comments, and different types of content blocks. Distinguishing between actual image links and other content might require context-aware parsing.\n\n4. **File extensions**: You would need to identify which file extensions to consider as images (e.g., .png, .jpg, .gif, .svg) and ensure you are not extracting non-image files with similar extensions.\n\n5. **Link formats**: Images in ORG files might be included using different link formats, such as direct links (`[[file:./image.png]]`) or descriptive links (`[[file:./image.png][description]]`). The parser needs to handle these variations correctly.\n\n6. **Embedded Org directives**: There may be Org-specific directives or macros that affect the inclusion of images that need to be understood and possibly interpreted by the parser.\n\n7. **Comments or inactive links**: The ORG file might contain commented-out image links or inactive links which should ideally not be extracted as they are not meant to be displayed.\n\n8. **Non-standard inclusions**: There might be non-standard ways of including images that are specific to certain configurations or extensions of the Org mode in Emacs, which could complicate the parsing.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser would need robust regex patterns or a parsing strategy that can understand the structure and syntax of ORG markup language. It may also require some understanding of the context where the image links appear."
