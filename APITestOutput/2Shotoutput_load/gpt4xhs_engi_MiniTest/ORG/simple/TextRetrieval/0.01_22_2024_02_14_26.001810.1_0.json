Typically, this is done with asterisks or equal signs (e.g., `*bold*` or `=bold=`). Understanding the specific syntax used in the file is essential.\n\n2. **Consistent formatting**: Assuming that the file is consistently formatted, it should be relatively straightforward to extract bold text. However, if there are deviations or errors in formatting, it might be harder to accurately identify all bold texts.\n\n3. **Embedded formatting**: Bold text might be embedded within other formatting options (e.g., within a list, a heading, or a link). This can complicate the extraction process as you need to differentiate between formatting for structure and formatting for emphasis.\n\n4. **Partial bolding**: Some lines might contain partial bolding where only certain words are bolded. This requires careful parsing to ensure that only the bolded parts are extracted.\n\n5. **Escape characters**: In some cases, asterisks or other characters used for formatting may be escaped (i.e., preceded by a backslash) to indicate they are not intended for formatting. The parser needs to recognize and handle escape characters properly.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text**: If the text to be extracted spans multiple lines, the parser must be able to handle and recognize continuation of bold text across line breaks.\n\n7. **Programming language constraints**: Depending on the programming language used for parsing, there might be limitations or particular libraries that would make extracting the bold text more difficult or easier.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file, these potential issues will guide the parsing process."
