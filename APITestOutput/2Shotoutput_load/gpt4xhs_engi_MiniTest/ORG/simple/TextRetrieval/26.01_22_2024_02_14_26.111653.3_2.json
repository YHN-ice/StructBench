It is important to understand this syntax to correctly identify image references.\n\n2. **Multiple formats**: Images could be embedded in various formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF). The parser must recognize all possible image formats.\n\n3. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Images could be included using either relative or absolute paths, and the parser needs to handle both.\n\n4. **Linked vs. embedded images**: ORG files can link to images hosted externally or include them directly through base64 encoding or similar methods. The parser should differentiate between these.\n\n5. **Textual noise**: There might be text that resembles an image file path but isn't one (e.g., within a code block or a comment). The parser must ignore such false positives.\n\n6. **File path variations**: File paths could have various special characters or URL-encoded components that need to be interpreted or decoded.\n\n7. **Image tags or attributes**: If the ORG file uses any additional attributes or tags with the image link, the parser must be able to extract just the file name and not any surrounding markup.\n\n8. **Repetitions and duplicates**: The same image might be referenced multiple times within the document. It needs to be decided whether to list duplicates or only unique instances.\n\nOnce these challenges are considered, the parser can be designed to accurately extract and list all image file names from the ORG file input."
