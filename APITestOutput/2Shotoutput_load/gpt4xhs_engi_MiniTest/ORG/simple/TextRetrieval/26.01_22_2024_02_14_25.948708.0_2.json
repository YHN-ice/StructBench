The parser must correctly identify and differentiate between links to images and other types of links.\n\n3. **File Path Complexity**: Image links might include absolute or relative paths and may contain spaces or special characters that need to be handled correctly.\n\n4. **File Extension Recognition**: The parser must recognize different image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) amidst text and other kinds of links.\n\n5. **Embedded Images vs. Linked Images**: Images may be embedded directly in the ORG file or linked from external sources. The parser needs to extract only the linked image file names, not any encoded image data.\n\n6. **Comments and Inactive Links**: Sometimes links might be commented out or presented in a way that they are not active links (e.g., within code blocks or examples). These should probably be ignored.\n\n7. **Markup Syntax**: ORG files use specific markup syntax for links, so it's important to parse based on that syntax without confusing it with regular text or other markup elements.\n\n8. **Multiple Links in One Line**: There could be multiple image links on a single line, and the parser should be able to extract all of them.\n\n9. **Performance**: If the ORG file is large with many links, the parser needs to be efficient in extracting the required information without taking too long to process.\n\n10. **Error Handling**: The parser should gracefully handle errors or unexpected input without crashing or producing incorrect output.\n\nOnce we see the input file content, we can apply these considerations to ensure accurate extraction of the image file names."
