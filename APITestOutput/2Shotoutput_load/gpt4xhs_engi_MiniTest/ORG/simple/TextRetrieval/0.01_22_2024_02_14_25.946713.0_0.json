Identifying Bold Syntax: ORG files use specific syntax to denote bold text, typically surrounding the text with asterisks (e.g., `*bold text*`). The parser needs to correctly identify this pattern.\n2. Line Breaks: Bold text may span multiple lines. The parser must handle line continuations properly without breaking the bold text extraction.\n3. Nested Formatting: Bold text might also include other formatting like italics, underlining, or code snippets. The parser must be careful not to be confused by nested formatting.\n4. Incomplete Markers: There may be instances where the bold markers are incomplete or used in non-formatting contexts (e.g., in code blocks or as part of a list). The parser must distinguish between formatting usage and other uses.\n5. Escaped Characters: Sometimes asterisks are escaped to prevent formatting (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`). The parser should recognize and ignore escaped formatting characters.\n6. Mixed Content: Text might contain both bold and non-bold elements on the same line, requiring the parser to selectively extract only the bold parts.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file content so I can assist you in identifying the bold texts according to ORG file syntax."
