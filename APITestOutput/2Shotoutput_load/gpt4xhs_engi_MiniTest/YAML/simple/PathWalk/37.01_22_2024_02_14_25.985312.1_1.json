For instance, if 'subs' contains a list of lists or a mixture of different data types, it may not be clear what is being referred to as the 'first object'.\n\n4. **Key Naming**: YAML is case-sensitive and keys need to be exact. If there are subtle differences in key naming (like 'Subs' instead of 'subs'), it may lead to missing the required data.\n\n5. **Variations in Data Types**: The 'id' field could have various data types (string, integer, etc.). Depending on how the information is requested, converting or interpreting these data types might pose a challenge.\n\n6. **Missing 'id' Field**: The 'id' field might not be present in all objects within 'subs', or it might be named differently. Ensuring that we're looking for the correct field is crucial.\n\n7. **Large Files and Performance**: If the YAML file is very large, performance might become an issue when parsing the file, depending on the parser's efficiency.\n\nOnce we have the YAML file, these potential difficulties can be taken into account to ensure accurate parsing and retrieval of the requested information."
