Missing colons or spaces can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Dashes in Lists**: Items in lists are typically denoted by a dash followed by a space.

        "True\n\nIn the provided YAML, the following structural errors are present:\n\n1. **Commas**: YAML does not typically use commas to separate key-value pairs. The commas after `Z: g,`, `Y: f,`, and `X: e,` are not necessary and can be removed.\n\n2. **Unexpected Colons and Values**: The presence of `:r`, `:s`, `:i`, `:j`, and `:k` at the end of the blocks is incorrect.
