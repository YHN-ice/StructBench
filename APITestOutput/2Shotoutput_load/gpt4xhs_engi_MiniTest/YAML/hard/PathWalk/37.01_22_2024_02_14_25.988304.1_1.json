If these are used, one must resolve the references correctly to determine the actual value of the id.\n\n4. **Data Type Interpretation**: YAML has implicit typing that might interpret unquoted strings as booleans or numbers (e.g., \"yes\" -> true, \"123\" -> 123). Ensuring that IDs are interpreted as strings, if they are meant to be strings, could be a potential issue.\n\n5. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents, separated by `---`. If \"subs\" appears in multiple documents, it would need to be clear which document’s “subs” we are referring to.\n\n6. **Inheritance and Overrides**: YAML allows for inheritance-like features where later entries can override earlier ones if they share the same key/path. Understanding overrides may be important in determining the correct id.\n\n7. **Large Files and Performance**: If the YAML file is very large, there might be performance considerations when parsing it.\n\n8. **Incorrect or Ambiguous Keys**: If there's a typo in the key name or multiple keys with similar names (e.g., \"sub\" vs. \"subs\"), it could create confusion about where to find the correct data.\n\nPlease provide the YAML input file so I can parse it and identify the first object’s id within \"subs\"."
