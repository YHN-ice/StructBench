Errors can occur if the data types are not properly defined, such as a missing dash for list items or incorrect nesting.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: Some characters have special meanings in YAML, such as the hash (#) for comments. If these characters are used in values without proper escaping, they can cause errors.\n\n6. **Duplicate Keys**: Keys within the same map should be unique.
