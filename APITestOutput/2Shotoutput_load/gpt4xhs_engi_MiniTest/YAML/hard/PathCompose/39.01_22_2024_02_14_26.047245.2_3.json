Ensuring the correct index is used can be tricky, especially if the sequences are nested.\n\n4. **Mappings (Dictionaries)**: Accessing values in mappings (similar to dictionaries) requires the correct key. If keys are not unique at each level or if they are dynamically generated, this can complicate access.\n\n5. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types for values (strings, numbers, booleans, nulls).
