However, there may be variations such as inline image syntax `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")` and reference-style image syntax where the URL is placed elsewhere in the document with a reference identifier.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files include images using HTML tags like `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"description\" />`. This can vary significantly and might be more challenging to parse consistently.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in Markdown can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. Identifying and extracting filenames will require parsing these paths correctly.\n\n4. **Link References Without Images**: It's possible for a Markdown file to include link references that resemble image syntax but are not actually used for images (e.g., `[1]: http://example.com`).\n\n5. **Nested Content**: Image links may be nested inside other elements, such as lists or blockquotes, which could complicate extraction if not handled properly.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape Markdown syntax characters to prevent them from being parsed, such as `!\\[Alt text\\](URL \"Title\")`. These should not be considered as image links.\n\n7. **Markdown Variants**: There are many flavors of Markdown, such as GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), which can have additional rules and syntax for images.\n\n8. **Non-standard Syntax**: Some Markdown files might use non-standard or poorly formatted syntax, which may not strictly adhere to the rules of Markdown for image embedding.\n\nTo address these challenges, a robust parsing strategy would be needed that can handle various cases and edge conditions. Now, please provide the Markdown file content so that I can process it and extract the image filenames."
