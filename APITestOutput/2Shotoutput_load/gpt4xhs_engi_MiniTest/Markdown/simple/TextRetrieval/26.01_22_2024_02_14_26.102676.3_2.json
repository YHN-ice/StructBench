Handling both properly will be necessary.\n\n2. **Diverse Link Formats**: Image links can be absolute URLs or relative paths, and they can also have various file extensions (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.). The parser must accommodate all these formats.\n\n3. **Alternate Text**: Images in Markdown are embedded with an alternate text that appears in square brackets `[ ]` preceding the actual link in parentheses `( )`. Ensuring that only the link part is extracted, not the alternate text, could be challenging.\n\n4. **Links vs. Images**: In Markdown, the syntax for embedding images is very similar to the syntax for creating hyperlinks. The difference is an exclamation mark `!` before the opening square bracket for images. It’s important not to confuse the two.\n\n5. **Image Titles or Tooltips**: Sometimes, image syntax includes titles or tooltips that follow the URL and are enclosed in double quotes `\" \"`. These should not be part of the extracted filename.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Escaped characters within the image paths or alternative text might need special handling to accurately represent the intended path.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which may complicate extraction.\n\n8. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown variants might have non-standard ways of including images that don't follow the traditional Markdown syntax.\n\nOnce we see the actual Markdown input, these points can guide in anticipating where issues might arise and help in accurately extracting the image files' names."
