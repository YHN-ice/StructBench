We need to ensure that all possible markdown syntaxes for bold are accounted for.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis:** Bold text can have nested emphases like italic or even other bold text. We need to decide whether to include or exclude nested formats in the extraction.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes the markdown might include escaped characters like `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be recognized as bold text.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks:** Bold syntax within inline code blocks (using backticks) should not be interpreted as bold. Example: `` `**not bold**` ``.\n\n5. **False Positives with Asterisks or Underscores:** Text with asterisks or underscores that aren't used for bold formatting might be mistakenly captured. For example, an asterisk used in a list item or underscores within words.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Texts:** Sometimes, bold text may span multiple lines. The parser should be able to handle this scenario and capture the entire content as one block of bold text.\n\n7. **Links and Images:** Markdown also allows for links and images, which could contain asterisks or underscores, potentially causing confusion when trying to extract just the bold text.\n\nTo handle these obstacles, a robust Markdown parser will often require a set of rules and regular expressions designed to match the specific patterns that constitute bold text while avoiding false positives."
