The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser must recognize both patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested within other formatting elements like italics, strikethrough, or even links. For instance: `**bold _and_ italic**` or `**bold [link](URL)**`. The parser needs to handle these cases without getting confused by the additional formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be escaped using a backslash to prevent them from being parsed as formatting, like `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should ignore escaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Inline code blocks using backticks `` ` `` can contain what looks like bold syntax but should not be formatted as such. For example: `` `**not bold**` `` should not be treated as bold text.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text can span multiple lines. The parser should be able to detect and handle multi-line bold text correctly.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: There may be instances where the formatting is incomplete or incorrect (e.g., only one asterisk on one side of the text), which should not be treated as bold text.\n\n7. **Markdown Flavors**: Different flavors of Markdown may have slightly different rules for parsing bold text. The parser should ideally be aware of these differences if they are relevant to the task.\n\n8. **Performance and Efficiency**: If the Markdown file is large, the parser needs to efficiently parse through the text without causing significant delays or consuming excessive resources.\n\n9. **Special Cases and Edge Cases**: There could be special or edge cases where the parser's rules might not apply cleanly, and these would need to be handled on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties requires a robust parsing algorithm that can correctly identify and extract bold texts while ignoring false positives."
