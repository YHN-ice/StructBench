The basic syntax is `![Alt text](URL)`, but images can also be linked with reference-style links, which separate the URL from the alt text with identifiers.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: The URLs for images can be either relative paths to a file within the same repository or system, or absolute URLs pointing to an external resource. We'll need to discriminate between these if only local image files are required.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown also allows for raw HTML to be embedded within the document. This means that `<img>` tags could also be used to include images, and we'd need to parse these as well.\n\n4. **Link Confusion**: It might be possible to confuse links with images since their syntax is similar. Links are formatted as `[Link text](URL)`. We must distinguish between the two since we're only interested in images.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, the image syntax could be escaped to prevent it from rendering as an image, such as `\\!\\[Alt text](URL)`. We need to identify these cases and not count them as actual images.\n\n6. **Markdown Variants**: Markdown has several variants, such as GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM), which may have slight differences in how images are handled. We would need to take into account the specific flavor of Markdown being used if relevant.\n\n7. **Nested Content**: Sometimes, images can be nested inside other elements, like lists or blockquotes, which may add complexity to the parsing process.\n\n8. **Broken Syntax**: If the Markdown file is hand-coded, there may be instances of incorrect syntax that would normally not render as images but look very close to the correct format; we'll need a way to handle these potential discrepancies. \n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we'll need more information about the specific input file to provide accurate file names for the included image files."
