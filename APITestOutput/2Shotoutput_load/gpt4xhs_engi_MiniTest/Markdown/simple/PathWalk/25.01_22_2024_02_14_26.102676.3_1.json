The parser needs to handle these correctly.\n\n3. **Nested Elements:**\n   Subsections may contain nested elements like lists, code blocks, blockquotes, or additional subheadings. Parsing these correctly and including them in the excerpt might be challenging.\n\n4. **Ambiguous References:**\n   If the numbering is not explicit in the file, such as \"1th section\" or \"1th subsection,\" there might be ambiguity in determining which section or subsection is being referred to.\n\n5. **Formatting Consistency:**\n   The Markdown file might have inconsistencies in formatting, which could lead to difficulties in parsing and extracting the right content.\n\n6. **Encoding and Character Issues:**\n   Special characters or encoding issues in the Markdown file could cause incorrect parsing or display of content.\n\n7. **External References or Links:**\n   The content might have hyperlinks or references to external resources that need to be correctly parsed and presented in the excerpt.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, these potential obstacles will need to be addressed to ensure accurate parsing and extraction of the desired information."
