Commonly, images are included with `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations in spacing, title inclusion, or even reference-style links can complicate extraction.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Images might be linked with absolute URLs (starting with `http://`, `https://`, or a protocol of some kind), or relative paths (which may refer to files within the same repository or directory). Distinguishing between these and extracting only file names could be challenging.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML:** Markdown supports inline HTML, so images might be included with `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax. This would require parsing HTML within the Markdown document.\n\n4. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions:** Some flavors of Markdown might have extensions that allow for non-standard ways to include images (like directives in some static site generators).\n\n5. **Link References:** Images might be included using reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. **False Positives:** Text that resembles image syntax but isn't intended to be an image (e.g., an example of how to write Markdown in a tutorial) could lead to false positives.\n\n7. **Encoded Images:** Images may also be included as Base64 encoded directly into the Markdown, which doesn’t have a filename but rather a data URI.\n\n8. **Complex Filenames:** Filenames can include spaces, special characters, or even URL-encoded characters, which may need decoding or careful handling when extracting.\n\nOnce the input Markdown file is provided, it will be necessary to parse through it carefully and extract the image file names while accounting for these potential difficulties."
