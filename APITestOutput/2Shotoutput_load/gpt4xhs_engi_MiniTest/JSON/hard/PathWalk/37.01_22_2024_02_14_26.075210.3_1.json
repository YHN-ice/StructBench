Parsing and interpreting these correctly is crucial for accurate data retrieval.\n\n7. **Complex arrays**: If the data is stored in complex arrays with multiple levels of nesting or a mix of different data types, it could be difficult to navigate and extract the correct information.\n\nNow that we've identified potential obstacles, please provide the JSON file or specify the information in it so that I can assist you with your question regarding the first object's id of subs."
