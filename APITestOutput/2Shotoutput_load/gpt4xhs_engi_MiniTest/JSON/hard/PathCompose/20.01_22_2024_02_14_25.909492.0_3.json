It is important to understand the hierarchy and navigate through the levels properly.\n\n2. **Similar Keys**: If the JSON contains multiple keys with the same name at different levels or in different branches, identifying the correct key to traverse the path can be confusing.\n\n3. **Arrays vs Objects**: JSON can have both arrays (list-like structures) and objects (dictionary-like structures). It's necessary to know when to use an index (for arrays) and when to use a key (for objects).\n\n4. **Key Names with Special Characters or Spaces**: If keys contain spaces or special characters, accessing them might require bracket notation instead of dot notation.\n\n5. **Dynamic Keys or Indices**: If the structure of the JSON is dynamic, where keys or array indices may change, it would not be possible to give a hard-coded path.\n\n6. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the values are of expected data types is essential. For example, attempting to index into a string as if it were an array would result in an error.\n\n7. **Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so it's important to use the exact casing when providing the path.\n\n8. **Large File Size**: For very large JSON files, it may be difficult to manually trace the path to a specific value without automated tools or scripts.\n\nOnce I see the JSON file structure, I can provide the specific path to access the value \"yy\".
