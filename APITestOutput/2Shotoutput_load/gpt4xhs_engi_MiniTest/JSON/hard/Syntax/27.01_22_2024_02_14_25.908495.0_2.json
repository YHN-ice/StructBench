Misinterpreting these types (like using single quotes for strings or an incorrect closing bracket) can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Comma Errors**: Having a trailing comma after the last key-value pair in an object or the last value in an array is not allowed in JSON.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8 without a BOM (Byte Order Mark).\n\n5. **Nested Structure Complexity**: Deeply nested objects or arrays can sometimes make it difficult to track the structure and can lead to errors if not closed properly.\n\n6. **Quotes and Special Characters**: Inside strings, certain characters need to be escaped, such as double quotes, backslashes, and control characters (like newline).\n\n7. **Large File Size**: For large JSON files, issues might arise from limitations in the parser's ability to handle the file size or from memory constraints during parsing.\n\nIdentifying structural errors requires careful examination of the JSON file according to these rules.
