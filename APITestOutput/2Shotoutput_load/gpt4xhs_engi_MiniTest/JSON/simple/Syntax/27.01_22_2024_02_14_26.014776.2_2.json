Single quotes ('') are not valid.\n\n2. **Comma Errors**: Missing or extraneous commas can cause issues. Each key-value pair should be separated by a comma except for the last pair in an object or array.\n\n3. **Data Type Issues**: Values must be of an appropriate data type (e.g., string, number, object, array, boolean, or null). Assigning an incorrect data type to a value could lead to an error.\n\n4. **Bracket Pairing**: Every opening bracket (whether curly `{` or square `[`) must be paired with a closing bracket of the same type. Mismatched or unbalanced brackets will result in errors.\n\n5. **Colon Usage**: Within each object, key-value pairs must be separated by a colon (:).\n\n6. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments. Including them will cause an error.\n\n7. **Trailing Commas**: Unlike some other languages that may be lenient with trailing commas in arrays or objects, JSON does not allow them.\n\n8. **Encoding Problems**: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8, and any issues with character encoding can cause problems with parsing.\n\n9. **Syntax Errors**: Any variation from the standard syntax rules of JSON will result in an error.\n\nPlease provide the JSON file content so that I can check it for structural errors."
