Curly Braces and Square Brackets Mismatch: Every opening curly brace `{` must have a corresponding closing curly brace `}`, and every opening square bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing square bracket `]`. Unbalanced or mismatched braces and brackets can cause errors.\n\n4. Data Types: JSON supports specific data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null.

Trailing Commas: While some parsers might be lenient, standard JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last item in an object or array.\n\n6.
