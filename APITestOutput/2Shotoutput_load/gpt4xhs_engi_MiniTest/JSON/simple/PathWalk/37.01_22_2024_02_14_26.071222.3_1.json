Inconsistencies can lead to errors in parsing.\n\n3. **Missing or Null Values**: The \"id\" field for the first object in \"subs\" might be missing, null, or have an unexpected value, which would require error handling.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it could be resource-intensive to parse, potentially leading to memory issues or slow processing times.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors in JSON**: Any syntax errors in the JSON file (missing commas, unmatched braces or brackets, etc.) could prevent successful parsing of the file.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file is not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), there could be issues reading and interpreting text correctly.\n\n7. **Access Permissions**: If the JSON file is stored remotely or in a secure location, there might be access permission issues that need to be resolved before parsing can occur.\n\nTo give an accurate answer, these obstacles would need to be addressed appropriately during the parsing process. Now, please provide the JSON file or contents so that I can proceed to find the first object's ID of \"subs\"."
