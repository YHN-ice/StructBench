JSON arrays are zero-indexed.\n\n3. **Key Names**: JSON keys are case-sensitive and must be spelled correctly, including the correct use of underscores, hyphens, or spaces if applicable.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Understanding the type of data (object, array, string, number, etc.) at each level is important for accessing the value correctly.\n\n5. **Complex Keys**: Sometimes keys in JSON can be strings with spaces or other characters that might require different access syntax (like bracket notation in JavaScript).\n\n6. **Large or Minified Files**: Large files can be difficult to navigate, and minified files can be hard to read without proper formatting.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file includes special characters, encoding issues may cause problems when trying to parse or access the data.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: JSON syntax errors (like missing commas or quotes) can prevent successful parsing of the file.\n\n9. **Dynamic Structure**: If the structure of the JSON is not static and changes dynamically, it can be challenging to provide a one-size-fits-all access pattern.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would typically format and inspect the JSON structure carefully, ensure correct syntax, pay attention to data types and key names, and use proper access methods depending on whether dealing with objects or arrays.
