It might require interpretation of names or other less-reliable indicators.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Data Entries:** The datatable might have inconsistent entries for gender. For example, some rows might use \"F\" for female, others might use \"female,\" \"woman,\" \"girl,\" etc., which would require normalization of the data.\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries:** If the same person is listed multiple times with different primeKeys by mistake, it could skew the count unless deduplication is properly handled.\n\n4. **Missing Data:** There may be rows where the gender information is missing or null, which could lead to an inaccurate count if not accounted for.\n\n5. **Data Spread Across Multiple Rows:** If a person's information is spread across multiple rows (as indicated by the same primeKey), it is important to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structure:** If the datatable has a complex or nested structure, extracting the necessary information could be technically challenging.\n\n7. **Data Size and Performance:** Depending on the size of the datatable, performance considerations may need to be taken into account to efficiently process the data without running into memory or speed issues.\n\n8. **Case Sensitivity:** The gender information might be case-sensitive, with entries like \"Female\", \"female\", \"FEMALE\", etc., which would require case normalization for accurate counting.\n\nOnce we have access to the input file, these challenges can be addressed more specifically."
