Format and Structure: The format of the datatable needs to be understood correctly. If the input data is not structured or formatted in a consistent way, it may be challenging to parse it accurately.\n\n2. Data Consistency: There might be inconsistencies in the way salary data is represented (e.g., different currencies, inclusion or exclusion of commas and decimal points, etc.), which could lead to inaccurate parsing.\n\n3. Large Data Sets: If the datatable contains a large number of records, performance could be an issue and it may take a considerable amount of time to process all the data.\n\n4. Duplicate Data: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, it is important to ensure that each person is only counted once, even if their data appears multiple times in the datatable.\n\n5. Data Errors: There could be errors or typos in the salary data, which may affect the accuracy of the count.\n\n6. Complex Queries: The need to compare salaries requires interpreting the data accurately and performing conditional checks, which can be complex if the data is not in a numeric format that is easily comparable.\n\n7. Incomplete Data: If any salary data is missing or incomplete, it may be difficult to determine whether those individuals should be included in the count.\n\n8. Data Privacy: Depending on the source of the datatable, there might be privacy concerns regarding the handling and processing of personal information such as salaries.\n\nOnce you provide the datatable, I'll be able to give a more precise answer to your query while navigating any potential obstacles."
