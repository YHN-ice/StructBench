Data Size: If the datatable is very large, it may require efficient parsing algorithms or techniques to process the data within a reasonable time frame.\n\n3. Identifying Unique Individuals: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, duplicates must be accounted for. It's essential to ensure that each person is only counted once, regardless of how many times their information appears in the datatable.\n\n4. Salary Field Consistency: The salary data must be consistent and in a numerical format that can be compared to the given threshold. If salaries are in different currencies or formats (like some with commas, decimal points, or non-numeric characters), normalization might be required.\n\n5. Missing or Incorrect Data: There may be incomplete or incorrect entries in the salary field, which could lead to inaccurate counts if not handled properly.\n\n6.
