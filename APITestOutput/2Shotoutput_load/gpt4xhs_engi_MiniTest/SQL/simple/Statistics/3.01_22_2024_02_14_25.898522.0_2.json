Missing Data: Some entries might have missing or null gender fields, which could lead to an undercount.\n\n3. Data Errors: There could be typographical errors in the gender field that would need to be identified and corrected to ensure an accurate count.\n\n4. Multiple Entries for the Same Person: If the table includes multiple rows for the same person (with the same primeKey), care must be taken to only count each individual once.\n\n5. Case Sensitivity: The parser needs to handle case sensitivity to ensure that \"female\", \"Female\", and \"FEMALE\" are all counted correctly.\n\n6. Ambiguous Data: In some cases, gender information might not be clear-cut, with entries such as \"non-binary,\" \"transgender female,\" etc. These would need to be classified appropriately based on the requirements of the count.\n\n7. Large Datasets: If the dataset is large, performance may become an issue, and efficient parsing and counting methods would be necessary.\n\n8.
