We would need to standardize the measurements to effectively compare them.\n\n3. **Missing or Incomplete Data:**\n   There might be missing data for some individuals either in their work location or height. Incomplete records will need to be handled appropriately (e.g., excluded from the count).\n\n4. **Data Type Issues:**\n   The height data might not be stored as numeric values, which would make comparisons difficult. We would need to convert strings or other formats into numeric values to perform the comparison.\n\n5. **Filtering Relevant Information:**\n   We'll need to filter the records to include only those people who work in CA and then further filter to include only those taller than 163.\n\n6. **Large Volume of Data:**\n   If the datatables are very large, performance considerations might come into play when running queries or processing the data.\n\n7. **Duplicates or Data Integrity:**\n   There could be duplicate records for the same person, which would affect the count. Ensuring that each individual is only counted once is essential for accuracy.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Location Information:**\n   The abbreviation \"CA\" might refer to California in the United States or could potentially refer to another place (e.g., Canada's Alberta province has the postal abbreviation CA). Clarifying this ambiguity would be necessary.\n\nOnce we have access to the input file, we'll be able to address these obstacles directly and provide a reliable answer to your question."
