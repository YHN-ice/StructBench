Extracting the exact text requires correctly matching opening and closing braces, which can be complex if there are nested braces.\n\n5. **Environment-based Formatting**: Bold text might also be set within specific environments, such as `theorems` or `sections`, where the formatting is not explicitly marked by a command but rather by the environment itself.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Macros**: A user might define a new command to make text bold, which would not be recognized without parsing and understanding the custom command definitions.\n\n7. **Conditional Compilation**: The LaTeX source may contain conditionals (e.g., `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`), which means some text might be included or excluded from the final document depending on these conditions. This affects what should be considered as \"extracted text\".\n\n8. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands**: In case of errors or incomplete commands within the LaTeX file, handling such cases gracefully can be a challenge.\n\n9. **Encodings and Character Representations**: Special characters in LaTeX might be represented using different encodings or commands, which should be considered when extracting text.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in creating a robust LaTeX parser that can accurately extract bold texts from the input file."
