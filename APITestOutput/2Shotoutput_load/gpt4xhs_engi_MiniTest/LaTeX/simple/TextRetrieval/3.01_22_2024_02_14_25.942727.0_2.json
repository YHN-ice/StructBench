The parser should be able to handle both scenarios.\n\n4. **Multiple figures in one command**: The `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple files in a single command, separated by commas.\n\n5. **Figure options**: The `\\includegraphics` command may also include options within square brackets before the file name, which should not be confused with the file name itself.\n\n6. **Commented out lines**: LaTeX files might have comments (lines starting with `%`), which could include commented out figure inclusion commands. These should not be treated as actual inclusions.\n\n7. **Custom commands**: There might be custom commands or macros defined in the document that internally include graphics. Parsing these would require understanding and expanding such macros.\n\n8. **Environment contexts**: Figures might be included within different environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), differentiating them from other inclusions like those within `table` environments or others.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be robust enough to handle these situations to correctly extract all figures included in the LaTeX document."
