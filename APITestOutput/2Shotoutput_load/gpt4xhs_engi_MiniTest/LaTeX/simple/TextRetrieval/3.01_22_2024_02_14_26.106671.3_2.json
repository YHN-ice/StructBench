The parser must handle all these cases.\n\n3. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that may alter the file name parsing, such as scaling or rotation options.\n\n4. **Comments**: Figure inclusion commands might be commented out using `%`. These should not be considered actual inclusions.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes commands like `\\includegraphics` are used inside other environments, such as `\\figure` or within a loop, which might include multiple files in a single command.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: LaTeX can include figures without specifying file extensions, as it can automatically figure out which image types to use. The parser must be able to handle file names both with and without extensions.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Users may define custom commands or environments that encapsulate figure inclusion commands, abstracting away the standard LaTeX commands.\n\n8. **File Encodings and Platforms**: File names might be encoded differently (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.) and different operating systems might use different directory separators (`/` for Unix-like systems and `\\` for Windows).\n\n9. **Order and Hierarchy**: Figures may be included within a hierarchical structure, and understanding the context might be important for certain applications.
