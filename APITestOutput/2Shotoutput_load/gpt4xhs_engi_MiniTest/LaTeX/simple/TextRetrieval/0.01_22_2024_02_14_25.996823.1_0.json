Any text that appears as a comment should not be treated as part of the document.\n\n5. **Brace Matching**: Since LaTeX uses braces `{}` to encapsulate the scope of commands, correctly identifying matching pairs is necessary to extract only the text that is meant to be bold.\n\n6. **Environment Blocks**: Bold text might be within an environment block that affects the formatting of the text, such as `itemize`, `enumerate`, or a custom-defined environment, which might require special handling.\n\n7. **Multi-line Text**: Bold commands might span multiple lines, so the parser has to handle line breaks correctly without losing the context of the command.\n\n8. **Inline vs. Display**: Bold text might appear in different contexts, such as within the main text or inside equations, figures, tables, etc., which can affect how it should be extracted.\n\n9. **Escaped Characters**: Special characters that are escaped in LaTeX (e.g., `\\%`, `\\_`, `\\\\`) should be handled properly during extraction to avoid misinterpretation.\n\n10. **Encoding**: The file encoding could potentially affect how text is read and interpreted if non-standard characters are used.\n\nThese are just some of the challenges that might be encountered when parsing a LaTeX file for bold text.
