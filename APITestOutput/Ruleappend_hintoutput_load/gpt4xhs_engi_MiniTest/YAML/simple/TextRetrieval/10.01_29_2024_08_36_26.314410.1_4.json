YAML supports various ways of representing an empty list or dictionary, such as using `[]`, `{}`, or simply not including the key at all.\n\n3. **Variety of Data Types**: YAML supports multiple data types such as strings, numbers, nulls, booleans, etc. Ensuring that we only consider objects (dicts/lists) when looking for `subs` fields will be crucial.\n\n4. **Inheritance and References**: YAML supports anchors (`&`), aliases (`*`), and merge keys (`<<`), which can create references to other parts of the document.
