However, some parsers might have to deal with non-standard implementations where keys are not unique.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: The parser must be able to handle syntax errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback if the YAML is not well-formed.\n\n7. **Search Efficiency**: Searching for an object by id requires traversing the data structure.
