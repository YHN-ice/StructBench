We need to differentiate between when an asterisk is used for formatting and when it's part of the content.\n\n3. **Multi-line Bold Texts:** Bold text might span across multiple lines. The parser must be able to detect and extract bold text that does not end on the same line it starts.\n\n4. **Uneven Asterisks:** There might be an uneven number of asterisks due to human error in the file, which could throw off the parsing logic if it strictly relies on pairs of asterisks.\n\n5. **Asterisks in Code Blocks or Examples:** In ORG mode, portions of text can be marked as code or examples, often demarcated by a special syntax like `#+BEGIN_SRC` and `#+END_SRC`. Asterisks within these blocks should not be treated as bold formatting.\n\n6. **Links and Filepaths:** Asterisks might be part of links (e.g., `[[*link]]`) or file paths, where they should not be interpreted as bold markers.\n\nTo correctly parse the bold texts, the parser must take into account these potential issues and implement logic to handle them appropriately. The parser needs to maintain a state or a counter to keep track of odd and even occurrences of asterisks and extract the text accordingly. It should also ignore asterisks that do not denote bold text due to their context or escaping."
