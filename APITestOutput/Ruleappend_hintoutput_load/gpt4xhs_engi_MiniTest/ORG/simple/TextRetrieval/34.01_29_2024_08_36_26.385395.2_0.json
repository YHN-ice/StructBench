Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Differentiating Bold Text from Other Syntax**: ORG mode uses asterisks for several different purposes, such as for headlines and lists. It's crucial to differentiate between these uses and the single asterisks used for bolding text.\n\n2. **Nested or Adjacent Formatting**: Bold text might be adjacent to or nested within other formatting, such as italic, underline, or code blocks. Care must be taken not to include formatting delimiters as part of the extracted text.\n\n3. **Escaped Asterisks**: Sometimes asterisks are escaped (e.g., `\\*`) to be included as part of the text and not as formatting. The parser must correctly interpret escaped asterisks.\n\n4. **Overlapping Formatting Ranges**: There can be overlapping formatting ranges when asterisks are used for other purposes. The parser has to ensure it is capturing the correct ranges for bold texts.\n\n5. **Unbalanced Asterisks**: There may be cases where an opening asterisk for bold text does not have a corresponding closing asterisk, leading to unbalanced pairs that have to be handled appropriately.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: If bold texts span multiple lines, the parser must handle line breaks properly.\n\n7. **Asterisks in Code or Example Blocks**: Asterisks within code or example blocks should not be interpreted as bold syntax.\n\nWith these potential issues in mind, we can proceed to parse the given ORG file for bold texts once it is provided."
