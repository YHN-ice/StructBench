Here are a few challenges that might arise:\n\n1. Nested formatting: If the ORG file contains nested formatting, such as bold text within italicized text or vice versa, it may be difficult to accurately determine the start and end of the bold text.\n\n2. Multiple consecutive stars: The use of multiple consecutive stars for different formatting (e.g., ** for bold and *** for bold-italic) could complicate the extraction if there is a need to distinguish between them.\n\n3. Inline code or literals: Text within inline code blocks or literals delimited by equal signs or tilde characters might contain asterisks that are not meant to indicate bold text but are part of the code or literals themselves.\n\n4. Escaped asterisks: Asterisks used in the text that are escaped (e.g., \\*) should not be considered as markers for bold text but as literal asterisks.\n\n5. Inconsistent formatting: Inconsistencies in the ORG file where the author may have accidentally missed closing an asterisk pair or used an incorrect number of asterisks can make it difficult to extract bold text reliably.\n\n6. Overlapping formatting ranges: If there are overlapping ranges of formatting (e.g., one bold range starts before another one ends), it might create ambiguity in determining the start and end points of each formatting range.\n\n7. Line breaks and whitespace: Depending on how the ORG file handles line breaks and whitespace around formatting characters, these could either interfere with or be part of the extracted text, requiring careful handling to maintain the intended formatting.\n\n8. Large files and performance: For very large ORG files, performance considerations might affect how quickly and efficiently the bold texts can be extracted.\n\n9. Ambiguous markup: If the ORG file uses custom or non-standard markup conventions, this could further complicate the extraction process.\n\nOnce I can see the input, I can apply these considerations to extract the bold texts according to the rules you've specified.
