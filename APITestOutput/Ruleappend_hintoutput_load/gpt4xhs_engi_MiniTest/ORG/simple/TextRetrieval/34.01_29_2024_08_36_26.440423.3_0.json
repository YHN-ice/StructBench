The main difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of extracting bold texts from an ORG file based on the given criteria might include:\n\n1. Nested Formatting: If there is nested formatting within the bold text, such as italic or underlined text that also uses asterisks or other markers, it could complicate the detection of the beginning and end of the bold text.\n\n2. Multiple Paragraphs: Bold text that spans multiple paragraphs or sections might be harder to detect if the formatting is not consistent across sections.\n\n3. Escape Characters: If asterisks are used in the content not for formatting but as part of the text itself, and if they are escaped properly, it would be important to distinguish these from formatting asterisks.\n\n4. Inconsistent Formatting: If the ORG file does not strictly follow the convention of using single asterisks for bold text, it might lead to incorrect extractions.\n\n5. Overlapping Formats: If there are overlapping formatting styles (like bold within bold), determining the correct range for each formatting style could be challenging.\n\nNote that without seeing the actual content of the ORG file, it's hard to predict all possible obstacles.
