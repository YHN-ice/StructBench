Distinguishing between image and non-image files may require checking the file extension or additional context.\n\n4. **Multiple Links on One Line**: Multiple links might be present on the same line, so the parser has to correctly identify and separate them.\n\n5. **Escape Characters or Markup**: The ORG file could contain escape characters or additional markup that could complicate simple pattern matching.\n\n6. **Nested or Commented Links**: Image links could be nested within other markup or commented out, and determining whether they should be included could be challenging.\n\n7. **Link Description**: ORG files allow for a description part of a link, which might contain arbitrary text, possibly including sequences that resemble a link. The parser must correctly ignore descriptions.\n\nTo parse the file accurately, the parser must navigate these potential challenges by implementing robust pattern matching and being aware of the structure and syntax of ORG files."
