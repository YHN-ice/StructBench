The parser will need to account for these different formats.\n\n3. **Non-Image Links**: Not all links may point to image files. The parser must distinguish between image file links and other types of links.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, characters within a link might be escaped (e.g., `[[file:my\\ image.jpg]]`). The parser should correctly interpret escaped characters.\n\n5. **Nested Links**: Links can be within other structures or formatted text which might make the regex or parsing logic more complicated.\n\n6. **Broken Syntax**: In some cases, the syntax for an image link might be incomplete or broken, such as missing one of the brackets. The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n7. **Comments and Directives**: ORG files can contain comments and directives that may include strings that look like image links but are not intended to be parsed as such.\n\n8. **Performance and Scalability**: If the ORG file is very large, the parser must be efficient to avoid performance issues.\n\n9. **Line Continuations**: ORG files may have line continuations where a link is split over multiple lines; thus, the parser must handle multi-line patterns.\n\n10. **File Path Resolution**: Some paths to images may be relative or use special characters that need to be resolved to actual file paths.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in designing a robust ORG file parser that can accurately extract image filenames."
