For instance, a heading can be preceded by one or more spaces or asterisks, and I must correctly interpret these to find the right section.\n\n3. **Multiple Sections with Similar Names**: The file might contain multiple sections with the same or similar titles. I need to correctly identify the section by its order (2nd in this case) rather than just by its title.\n\n4. **Nested Content**: If a section contains nested subsections or sub-subsections, I need to include all of that content in my response, unless the query specifies otherwise.\n\n5. **Incomplete Structures**: Sometimes, a file may have incomplete or incorrectly formatted structures (e.g., missing closing tags for a section). Detecting and handling such cases could be challenging.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the file contains special characters or has an encoding different from what is expected, interpreting the content could be difficult.\n\n7. **Large Files**: If the ORG file is particularly large, it might take more time to parse and find the requested section.\n\n8. **Embedded Content**: ORG files can contain links, footnotes, and other embedded content that needs to be handled appropriately while parsing.\n\nTo proceed correctly, I would start with the assumption that the ORG file is well-formed with consistent formatting for headings and subheadings, and that the query's numbering corresponds to the order of sections and subsections within the file."
