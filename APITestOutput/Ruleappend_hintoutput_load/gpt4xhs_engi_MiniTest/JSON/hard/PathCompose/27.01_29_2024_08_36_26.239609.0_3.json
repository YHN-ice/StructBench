Similar Keys: If the JSON file has similar or identical keys at different nesting levels, it may be confusing to ensure that the search is following the correct path to the targeted value.\n\n3. Large Files: A very large JSON file could pose performance issues when parsing and searching for a value. This could require optimizations to the search algorithm to handle the data efficiently.\n\n4. Ambiguous Paths: There might be multiple paths leading to similar values. In such cases, it's important to identify the correct path that leads to the specific \"qy\" value in question.\n\n5. Arrays: Handling arrays within the JSON structure can be tricky, especially if the target value is within an array. Indices need to be properly handled in the path.\n\n6. Error Handling: It is possible that the given value does not exist in the JSON file, or there may be parsing errors due to malformed JSON. Appropriate error handling must be in place to deal with such scenarios.\n\n7. Dynamic Data Types: JSON supports various data types (e.g., object, array, string, number, boolean, null). The search algorithm needs to handle each data type appropriately, especially when recursively searching through objects and arrays.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it is important to have a robust search algorithm that can recursively traverse the JSON structure, keep track of the path as it goes deeper into the nested objects and arrays, and handle various data types and errors gracefully."
