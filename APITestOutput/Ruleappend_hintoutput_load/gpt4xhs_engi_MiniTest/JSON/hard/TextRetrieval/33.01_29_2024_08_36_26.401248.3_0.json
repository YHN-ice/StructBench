If the data is deeply nested, it may require a recursive approach to search through all the layers to find the object with the desired id.\n\n2. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it could be challenging to process it efficiently. It may require stream-based parsing or other techniques to handle memory management.\n\n3. **Non-Unique IDs**: If the file has non-unique ids, and the question is asking for an object with a specific id, there may be multiple matches. The parser must ensure it finds the correct object according to additional context or criteria.\n\n4. **Data Integrity Issues**: If the JSON file is not well-formed or contains errors (like missing commas, unclosed quotes, etc.), the parser might fail to read it correctly, which could lead to incorrect answers or inability to parse.\n\n5. **Encoding and Special Characters**: JSON files can contain special characters or be encoded in different formats (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.). The parser needs to handle encoding correctly to avoid any corruption of data.\n\n6. **Multiple Objects with 'subs' Fields**: If there are multiple objects with 'subs' fields, the parser needs to ensure that it is searching through all possible paths to find the object with the specified id.\n\n7. **Handling Different Data Types**: JSON supports various data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. The parser should correctly handle each data type while searching for the specified id.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must:\n\n- Use a recursive function to handle nested structures.\n- Implement efficient memory handling for large files.\n- Ensure only unique ids are considered if that's what's required.\n- Validate the JSON file for correctness before parsing.\n- Handle different encodings and special characters appropriately.\n- Navigate through all 'subs' fields in the data structure.\n- Account for different data types within the JSON file.\n\nOnce I am provided with the JSON file or a representation of its structure, I can attempt to parse it and answer the question as per the given instructions."
