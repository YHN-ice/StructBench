Distinguishing between an object that contains further nested objects and one that does not requires checking the contents of each object's `subs` field carefully.\n\n4. **Handling empty lists or objects**: If an object's `subs` field is an empty list or object, it should be considered a leaf node, and its representation should be extracted without any further nesting.\n\n5. **Maintaining the original structure**: When extracting the most deeply nested objects, maintaining the original format as it appears in the JSON file is essential to fulfill the requirement.
