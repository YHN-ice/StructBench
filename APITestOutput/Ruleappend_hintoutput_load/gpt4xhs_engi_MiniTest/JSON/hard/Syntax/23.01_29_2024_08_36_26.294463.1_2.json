Missing one can cause the structure to be invalid.\n\n2. **Improper Commas**: Commas `,` are used to separate elements in an array or to separate key-value pairs in an object. A common error is having an extra comma after the last element or pair, or missing a comma between elements or pairs.\n\n3. **Unquoted Strings**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes `\"`. Single quotes `'` are not valid, and keys without quotes are invalid as well.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON only supports certain data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). If there's an unsupported data type or improper formatting (like a trailing comma in a number), it's an error.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: JSON should be encoded in UTF-8, and if there's any deviation from this encoding, it might not be parsed correctly.\n\n6. **Nested Structures**: When dealing with nested arrays or objects, it's easy to lose track of the corresponding closing brackets or braces.\n\n7. **Handling Escape Characters**: In JSON strings, some characters like newlines, tabs, or quotes must be escaped with a backslash (`\\`). Improperly escaped characters can lead to errors.\n\n8. **Whitespace**: While whitespace is generally ignored in JSON, it must not appear within tokens (like between the characters of a string value or a number).\n\n9. **File Size**: Extremely large JSON files may pose challenges for some parsers that could run out of memory or take a long time to validate.\n\n10. **Comments**: JSON does not support comments. If a file includes comments using `//` or `/* */`, it is not valid JSON.\n\nTo spot these errors, parsers typically tokenize the input and apply the JSON grammar rules to ensure the structure is correct. If the parser encounters anything unexpected that doesn't follow the rules, it flags it as an error."
