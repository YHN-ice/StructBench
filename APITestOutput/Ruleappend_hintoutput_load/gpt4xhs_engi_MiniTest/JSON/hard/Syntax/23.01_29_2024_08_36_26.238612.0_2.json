        "True\n\nThere are structural errors in the provided JSON. Here are the issues:\n\n1. Missing closing braces for several objects. For example, after the `\"subs\":[]` array for the object with `\"id\":\"j\"`, there should be a closing brace `}` before the next object with `\"id\":\"k\"` begins.\n\n2. There are multiple instances where a new object begins without a comma separating it from the previous object within the same array. For example, in the `\"subs\":[]` array for the object with `\"id\":\"i\"`, there's no comma separating the objects with `\"id\":\"j\"` and `\"id\":\"k\"`.\n\n3. The very last object is missing closing brackets and braces. At the end of the JSON, there should be closing square bracket `]` to close the `\"subs\"` array for the object with `\"id\":\"o\"`, and closing curly braces `}` to close the objects and the root object itself.\n\nHere's an example correction for point 1 and 2 (not the full correction for the whole JSON):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\":\"i\",\n  \"V\":\"zy\",\n  \"U\":\"yy\",\n  \"subs\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"j\",\n      \"T\":\"xy\",\n      \"subs\":[]\n    }, // <- Added comma here\n    {\n      \"id\":\"k\",\n      \"S\":\"wy\",\n      \"subs\":[]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON needs to be thoroughly reviewed and corrected for all such instances."
