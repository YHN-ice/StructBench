Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise:\n\n1. Missing or Extra Commas: JSON objects and arrays use commas to separate elements. A missing or extra comma can cause parsing to fail.\n\n2. Missing Quotation Marks: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Missing quotation marks can lead to errors.\n\n3. Incorrect Brackets: JSON objects are enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Mismatched or incorrectly nested brackets can cause issues.\n\n4. Data Type Issues: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Incorrect data types or mismatched formats can result in errors.\n\n5. Trailing Commas: While some parsers allow trailing commas, they are not officially supported in JSON and can lead to errors in strict parsers.\n\n6. Encoding Problems: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. Encoding issues can prevent proper parsing.\n\n7. Deeply Nested Objects: Deeply nested objects can sometimes complicate parsing, especially if the nesting leads to mistakes in the structure.\n\n8. Large Files: Very large JSON files can be difficult to parse efficiently and may require streaming parsers or special handling.\n\n9. Comments: JSON does not officially support comments. Including them can cause parsing to fail in strict JSON parsers.\n\nIt's important to thoroughly check the JSON file for these common issues to ensure it is well-formed and can be correctly parsed. If any of these structural errors are found, they would need to be corrected for the JSON to be valid."
