It's important to ensure that the recursive function correctly identifies when an object has no further nested objects (`subs` field is empty).\n\n3. **Multiple Deeply Nested Objects**: There could be multiple objects at the deepest level, and all of them need to be identified. Ensuring that the logic captures all such objects without missing any is important.\n\n4. **Performance Concerns**: Depending on the size of the JSON file and the number of nested objects, performance might be a concern, and the algorithm may need to be optimized for speed and memory usage.\n\n5. **Correct Representation of Output**: The output needs to be presented as it appears in the JSON file, with proper formatting. This requires careful extraction and formatting of the object data.\n\n6. **Handling of Data Types**: Since the requirement is to ignore objects that have further lists or dicts, it's important to correctly identify and skip these data types during traversal.\n\n7. **Infinite Recursion or Cycles**: A poorly constructed JSON or an error in the recursive logic could lead to infinite recursion if cycles are present or if the termination condition is never met.\n\n8. **Data Validation**: Ensuring that the JSON file is valid and that all objects follow the expected structure (having a `subs` field) is necessary before processing.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, it's crucial to approach the problem methodically, likely by creating a recursive function that traverses each object and checks its `subs` field while keeping track of the depth level to find the most deeply nested objects that have no further lists or dictionaries as values."
