A recursive approach is typically necessary to search through all possible paths.\n\n2. **Homogeneous Arrays**: If the JSON file contains arrays of objects, each object within the array must be checked for the specified ID.\n\n3. **Non-unique IDs**: If the IDs are not guaranteed to be unique, there might be multiple objects with the same ID. Care must be taken to decide whether to return the first match or all matches.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it could be challenging to process it all at once due to memory constraints.
