Recursive algorithms need to be effectively implemented to navigate through the nested structures.\n\n2. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it could pose performance issues, especially if the entire file needs to be loaded into memory. Efficient parsing strategies or streaming parsers might be required to handle large files.\n\n3. **Non-Unique IDs**: The possibility of non-unique ids could complicate the search. If ids are not guaranteed to be unique, then additional logic would be needed to ensure that the correct object is returned.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports various data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. Ensuring that the parser correctly interprets these data types when searching for the target id is crucial.\n\n5. **Missing or Incorrect Fields**: The JSON file might have missing fields or incorrect data. Error handling would be necessary to manage these situations without causing the parser to fail.\n\n6. **Circular References**: Although not very common in JSON, if there are circular references, it could cause infinite loops in a naive recursive search implementation.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the file encoding is not properly handled, it could lead to parsing errors or incorrect data interpretation.\n\n8. **File Accessibility**: If the file is very large or stored remotely, accessing the file might take time and could require additional code to handle file streaming or partial loading.\n\n9. **Syntax Errors**: If the JSON file contains syntax errors, the parser will not be able to process it correctly. Proper error reporting and handling are necessary.\n\n10. **Search Efficiency**: Depending on the search algorithm used, finding the object with the specified id may take longer if it's located at the end of a very large structure. Optimization strategies may be needed for faster retrieval.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust JSON parsing strategy would involve efficient recursive algorithms with proper error handling, search optimization techniques, and memory management practices.
