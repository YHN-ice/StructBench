Proper error handling would be needed.\n\n4. **Different Data Types**: The first element of the 'subs' list might not be an object with an 'id' field. It could be a simple data type like a string or a number, which would not have an 'id'.\n\n5. **Key Errors**: If the key for the subs list or the id field is different from what you expect (e.g., due to a typo or case sensitivity), you won't be able to access the data correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, you could:\n\n- Validate the JSON structure before parsing.\n- Use a parser that provides clear error messages and allows for easy navigation of JSON structures.\n- Implement checks to ensure 'subs' exists and is not empty before trying to access its elements.\n- Check that the first element of 'subs' is an object and has an 'id' field before accessing it.\n- Handle exceptions and errors gracefully to provide useful feedback.\n\nHere's a pseudo-code example of how you might parse the JSON file to find the first object's id of 'subs':\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ntry:\n    # Load the JSON file into a variable\n    with open('data.json', 'r') as file:\n        data = json.load(file)\n    \n    # Navigate to the 'subs' list\n    subs = data['outermost_object_key']['subs']\n    \n    # Check if 'subs' is not empty and get the first object's id\n    if subs:\n        first_object_id = subs[0]['id']\n        print(\"The first object's id of subs is:\", first_object_id)\n"
