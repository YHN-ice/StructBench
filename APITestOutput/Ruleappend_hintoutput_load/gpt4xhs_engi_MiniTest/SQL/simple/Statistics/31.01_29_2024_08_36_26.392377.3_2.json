Inconsistent Data Format: If the datatable is not consistently formatted, it might be difficult to parse the data correctly. For example, the gender field may vary in its representation (e.g., 'Male', 'male', 'M', 'm').\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: Rows may have missing or incomplete information in the gender column, which would make it challenging to determine the individual's gender.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: The presence of duplicate rows with the same primeKey could lead to an inaccurate count if not handled properly.\n\n4. Ambiguity in Gender Representation: If the gender column contains non-binary or other gender options besides 'male' or 'female', additional rules will be needed to count only those identified as male.\n\n5. Large Volume of Data: If the datatable contains a very large number of entries, performance considerations may come into play, potentially requiring more efficient parsing algorithms to process the data in a timely manner.\n\n6. Incorrect Column Identification: If the instructions for finding the gender column are unclear or if there are multiple columns related to gender (e.g., gender, sex, etc.), it might result in incorrect counting.\n\n7. Data Spread Across Multiple Tables: If the information about individuals is spread across multiple tables, it would require joining or correlating data across these tables correctly using the primeKey.\n\n8. Data Corruption: If the file is corrupted or has encoding issues, parsing might fail or result in incorrect data interpretation.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, care must be taken to standardize and validate the data before processing, handle duplicates and missing values appropriately, and implement robust parsing logic that can handle various representations of gender data."
