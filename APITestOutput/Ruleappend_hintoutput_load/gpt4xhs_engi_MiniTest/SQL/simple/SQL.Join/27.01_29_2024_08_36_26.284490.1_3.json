        "To solve the problem, you need to join the two tables based on the `primeKey` and then filter rows that satisfy both conditions: working in \"CA\" and being taller than 180 cm. After joining the tables and applying the filters, you can count the number of rows that meet these criteria.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution, assuming you can use SQL or a similar querying language:\n\n1. Perform an inner join on the two tables using `primeKey` as the join condition.\n2. Filter the resulting table where `location` is 'CA'.\n3. Filter further where `height` is greater than 180.\n4. Count the number of rows that satisfy these conditions.\n\nIn SQL, this would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM first_table\nJOIN second_table ON first_table.primeKey = second_table.primeKey\nWHERE second_table.location = 'CA' AND first_table.height > 180;\n```\n\nGiven the provided data, the join operation would result in:\n\n```\nprimeKey\tgender\tage\tname\theight\tweight\tcolor\tstatus\tsalary\tcompany\tlocation\na\tfemale\t46\tr\t184\t120\twhite\tunemployed\t90818\tMicrosoft\tCA\ne\tmale\t70\tv\t169\t159\tswarthy\temployed\t981032\tMeta\tCA\n```\n\nApplying the filters for location 'CA' and height greater than 180, we get:\n\n```\nprimeKey\tgender\tage\tname\theight\tweight\tcolor\tstatus\tsalary\tcompany\tlocation\na\tfemale\t46\tr\t184\t120\twhite\tunemployed\t90818\tMicrosoft\tCA\n```\n\nCounting the rows of this filtered result gives us the answer:\n\n**1 person** who works in CA is taller than 180 cm."
