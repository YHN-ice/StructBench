        "Based on the information given and assuming there is no other data beyond these tables, we can answer the question by joining the tables based on the primeKey and then filtering out rows that meet the conditions: location is NY (New York) and height is greater than 171.\n\nFrom the second table, there are no entries for people who work in NY (New York); all the provided locations are different states (IL, WA, CA, GA, TX). Therefore, without additional data indicating otherwise, we can conclude that based on the given tables, there are no people who work in NY and are taller than 171.\n\nIf \"NY\" is meant to be a generic placeholder for a city name rather than New York, we still cannot match any records since there are no city names in the location column of the second table.
