For example, `<book>` should be closed with `</book>`.\n\n2. **Improper Nesting**: Tags should be properly nested within each other. For example, if you have `<a><b></a></b>`, this is incorrect because the `<b>` tag is not properly nested within the `<a>` tag.\n\n3. **Unclosed Tags**: Sometimes tags are not properly closed, either missing the closing bracket `>` or the entire closing tag.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Special characters like `&`, `<`, and `>` should be escaped in XML content. For example, `&` should be written as `&amp;`.\n\n5. **XML Declaration Issues**: The XML declaration (if present) should be at the start of the document and properly formed (`<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>`).\n\n6. **Attribute Errors**: Attributes must be quoted correctly, and an attribute should not be duplicated.\n\n7. **Case Sensitivity**: XML tags are case-sensitive, meaning `<Tag>` and `<tag>` would be considered different elements.\n\n8. **Whitespace**: While usually not an issue for XML parsers, excessive or unexpected whitespace can sometimes affect the structure, especially if whitespace is used within tags or attribute names.\n\n9. **Invalid Characters**: Invalid characters in XML include certain control characters that are not allowed in XML content.\n\n10. **Encoding Mismatches**: The specified encoding in the XML declaration must match the actual encoding used in the file.\n\n11. **Namespace Issues**: If namespaces are used, they need to be declared and used consistently and correctly.\n\n12. **Schema/Doctype Declarations**: If the XML is meant to conform to a schema or doctype, errors might arise if the content does not match the defined structure.\n\nWhen asked to identify structural errors in an XML file, I will look for these common issues within the provided content.
