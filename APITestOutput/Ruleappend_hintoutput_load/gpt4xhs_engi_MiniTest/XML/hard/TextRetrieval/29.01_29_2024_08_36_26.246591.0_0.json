If there are multiple tags with the same name, but at different levels of nesting, it can be challenging to identify the correct one.\n\n2. **Attributes in Tags**: Tags can have attributes that might make it more challenging to simply search for a tag by its name. One has to ensure that the correct opening tag is identified despite any attributes that might be present.\n\n3. **Namespaces**: XML namespaces are used to distinguish between different XML documents that may use the same tag names but for different purposes. This might require additional parsing logic to handle namespaces correctly.\n\n4. **Incomplete or Malformed XML**: If the XML file is not well-formed (for example, missing an ending tag or having mismatched tags), this can lead to difficulties in parsing the content correctly.\n\n5. **Character Encoding**: XML supports various character encodings. If the encoding of the XML content is not correctly interpreted, this can lead to incorrect parsing of the content.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Special characters in XML are often escaped (such as `&lt;` for '<' and `&gt;` for '>'). A parser must correctly interpret these escape sequences to accurately extract content.\n\n7. **CDATA Sections**: The XML may contain CDATA sections which can include characters that would normally be interpreted as XML markup. The parser needs to correctly handle CDATA sections to extract the intended text.\n\n8. **Large Files**: Very large XML files may pose a challenge in terms of memory usage and performance when parsing.\n\n9. **Comments**: XML can have comments, which should not be mistaken for content. The parser should ignore comments when extracting tag content.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust XML parsing approach should be used that can correctly navigate the XML structure, handle attributes and namespaces, deal with special characters and CDATA sections, and gracefully manage large files and comments."
