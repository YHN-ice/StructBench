Ambiguity in attribute values: If the value 'yw' is used for different attributes in multiple tags, it can be unclear which tag is being asked for without additional context.\n\n2. Non-unique attributes: XML allows for the same attribute to be used with different values across elements. If 'yw' is not unique, multiple tags may have an attribute with this value.\n\n3. Namespaces: The XML file might use namespaces, which can affect the tag name and how it is referenced or searched.\n\n4. Inconsistent formatting: XML files may have variations in formatting such as spaces, line breaks, or use of single vs. double quotes, which could complicate searching for exact text strings.\n\n5. Similar tags or attributes: There could be similar tag names or attributes that contain the 'yw' string within a larger string, leading to false matches if not carefully parsed.\n\n6. Encodings and special characters: If the XML file includes special character encodings or if 'yw' is part of such an encoding, it may not be straightforward to find the correct tag by simple text search.\n\n7. XML parsing errors: Ill-formed XML due to mismatched tags, unclosed tags, or other syntax errors can make it difficult to correctly identify the tag with the specified attribute value.\n\n8. Large file size: If the XML is very large, it might be inefficient or difficult to search through the entire document for a single attribute value without proper tools or methods.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, typically one would use an XML parser that's capable of navigating the DOM (Document Object Model) of an XML file, querying for specific attributes and their values, handling namespaces and special characters correctly, and dealing with large files efficiently."
