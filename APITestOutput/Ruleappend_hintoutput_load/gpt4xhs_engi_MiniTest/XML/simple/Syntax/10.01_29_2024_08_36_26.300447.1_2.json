Missing closing tags: Every opening tag in XML must have a corresponding closing tag. If a closing tag is missing, the structure is invalid.\n\n2. Mismatched tag names: Opening and closing tags must match exactly, including case sensitivity, as XML is case-sensitive.\n\n3. Incorrect nesting of elements: Elements must be properly nested within each other. For example, if an element `A` contains element `B`, the closing tag of `B` must appear before the closing tag of `A`.\n\n4. Unescaped special characters: Characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and `\"` must be escaped in XML content using entities like `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&apos;`, and `&quot;`.\n\n5. Attribute errors: Attributes must have values enclosed in quotes, and there should not be duplicate attributes within the same element.\n\n6.
