We would need to ensure that these do not affect the extraction of the bold text itself.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters:** Markdown allows for escaping characters that would otherwise be interpreted as formatting. For example, `\\**` would not be considered as starting or ending a bold section. We would need to ignore escaped double stars.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting:** Sometimes, users mistakenly use an uneven number of asterisks or forget to close the bold formatting with double stars. This could lead to incorrect extraction if not handled properly.\n\n4. **Line Breaks:** In some Markdown parsers, bold text that spans across multiple lines may not be interpreted as bold unless certain conditions are met. We would need to consider whether to include such content.\n\n5. **Literal Double Stars:** There might be occurrences of double stars that are meant to be taken literally (as part of a code block, for example) and should not be interpreted as Markdown formatting.\n\n6. **Overlapping or Adjacent Bold Sections:** If there are two bold sections directly adjacent to each other or overlapping (due to an error in Markdown formatting), we would need to decide how to handle these cases and extract the text accordingly.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues, we can proceed with caution when parsing the Markdown file and ensure our method accounts for these possible complications."
