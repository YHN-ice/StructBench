We must differentiate between actual bold markers and escaped characters.\n\n3. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes users forget to close the bold formatting with a second set of double stars. We need to decide how to handle these cases—either by ignoring them or treating them as bold up to the end of the line or paragraph.\n\n4. **Overlapping or Adjacent Bold Sections**: There may be instances where bold sections are directly adjacent to each other or overlap with other formatting, making it tricky to parse.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and we'll need to ensure that we capture the entire range of bold text.\n\n6. **Line Breaks within Bold Sections**: Line breaks within bold sections could be interpreted as the end of bold formatting in some parsers, so we'll need to maintain the formatting across line breaks.\n\n7. **Consistent Use of Markers**: The input might use different styles for bold (e.g., using underscores instead of asterisks), so we should clarify which markers we're looking for.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: For very large Markdown files, the performance of the parser might become a concern and require efficient algorithms.\n\n9. **Ambiguity in Formatting Overlap**: If there are overlapping formatting marks (like bold and italic), it might be challenging to determine which formatting takes precedence without additional context.\n\nThe parser needs to be designed with these potential difficulties in mind to accurately extract bold text from the Markdown file."
