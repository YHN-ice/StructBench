When parsing a Markdown file to extract image file names, there could be several difficulties and obstacles, such as:\n\n1. **Variations in Image Syntax**: Markdown allows some flexibility in the syntax for embedding images. Although the standard format is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, users might omit the alt text, title, or use variations like omitting quotes around the title.\n\n2. **Complex File Paths**: The TARGET part of the image syntax could contain complex file paths, including directories, subdirectories, and file names with various extensions.\n\n3. **Non-image URLs**: The parser needs to correctly distinguish between image file URLs and other types of URLs (like links to web pages) that may also be included in the Markdown.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image references could be either relative or absolute paths, and the parser must extract these accurately.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: File names may contain special characters that need to be properly handled, like spaces encoded as `%20` or other URL-encoded characters.\n\n6. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files may include inline HTML tags for images, which would not follow the standard Markdown image syntax.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape characters in Markdown to prevent them from being parsed as Markdown, such as `\\![]()` which should not be treated as an image.\n\n8. **Comments and Disabled Links**: Comments in Markdown or disabled links (using HTML comments or other methods) might contain image-like syntax that should not be extracted as actual images.\n\nTo ensure accuracy when answering your question, the parser must handle these potential complications and extract only the valid image file names from the Markdown content provided."
