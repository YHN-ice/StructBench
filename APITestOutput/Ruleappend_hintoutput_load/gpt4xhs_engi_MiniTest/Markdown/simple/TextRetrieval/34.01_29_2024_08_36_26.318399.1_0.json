Handling these nested elements correctly without including them as part of the raw bold text might be challenging.\n\n2. **Escaped markers**: Sometimes, in Markdown, the bold markers (**) can be escaped to show literal asterisks instead of making text bold. Distinguishing between escaped markers and actual bold markers is necessary for accurate parsing.\n\n3. **Incorrectly paired markers**: There could be instances where the double asterisks are not correctly paired due to author errors; for example, there could be an odd number of double asterisks in the document. This would require a decision on how to handle such cases.\n\n4. **Overlapping styles**: Bold text might overlap with other styles, such as italicized text (marked with * or _). Determining which style takes precedence or how to extract just the bold text can be complicated.\n\n5. **Line breaks**: Since Markdown allows line breaks within bold text, ensuring that the parser correctly identifies bold text across lines is important.\n\n6. **Variations in syntax**: Besides double asterisks, Markdown also allows double underscores (__) to signify bold text. The parser should therefore be designed to recognize both forms.\n\n7. **Performance issues**: If the Markdown file is exceptionally large, performance could become an issue, requiring efficient algorithms for parsing.\n\n8. **Edge cases**: Various Markdown implementations and extensions could introduce edge cases that the parser might not expect, requiring thorough testing and potentially custom handling.\n\nDepending on the input file and its contents, any of these issues could arise and would need to be addressed in order to accurately extract all bold texts."
