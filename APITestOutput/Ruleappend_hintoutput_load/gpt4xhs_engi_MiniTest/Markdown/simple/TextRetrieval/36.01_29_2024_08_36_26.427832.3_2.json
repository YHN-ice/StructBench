For example, a URL in parentheses following an exclamation point that is not meant to be an image.\n\n3. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be included within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which could complicate the extraction if we are not careful to consider these cases.\n\n4. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but rather placed elsewhere in the document with a reference ID.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that make up the Markdown syntax might be escaped to show them as literals, which could be mistaken for actual syntax.\n\n6. **Image Titles with Special Characters**: If the title of the image includes special characters (like parentheses or quotation marks), it could potentially break simple regex-based parsing.\n\n7. **Multiple Images in a Line**: There might be lines with more than one image, and the parser should handle these correctly by extracting all images from such lines.\n\n8. **Images Without Alt Text or Titles**: In some markdown files, images might not have alt text or titles, which means the parser has to handle patterns that might not exactly fit the expected syntax.\n\nTo correctly extract all image files, the parser must be able to handle all these edge cases effectively."
