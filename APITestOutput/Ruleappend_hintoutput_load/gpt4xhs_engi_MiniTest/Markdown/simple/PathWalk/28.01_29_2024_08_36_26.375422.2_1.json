For instance, there might be multiple first-level headings before a second-level heading appears.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: The Markdown file could have inconsistent formatting. For example, some sections might use an alternative syntax for headings (e.g., underlining with equal signs or dashes for level one and two headings, respectively).\n\n4. **Links and Images**: If the section contains links or images, it might be necessary to decide whether to include them as plain text, reference-style text, or to exclude them.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Lists**: Code blocks or lists within the section might require special handling to ensure they are correctly represented in the excerpt.\n\n6. **Text Modifiers**: Bold, italicized, or strikethrough text will need to be included as they appear in the Markdown file.\n\n7. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include HTML tags for additional styling or functionality. Deciding how to handle these could be an obstacle.\n\n8. **Tables**: If the subsection includes a table, it may be necessary to decide how to represent the table structure in plain text.\n\n9. **Footnotes and References**: Footnotes or reference-style links might make it harder to extract only the content without their corresponding references at the bottom of the document.\n\n10. **Length of Content**: The subsection could be very long, and ensuring that the entire content is captured without missing any part could be a challenge.\n\nThese are just a few potential issues.
