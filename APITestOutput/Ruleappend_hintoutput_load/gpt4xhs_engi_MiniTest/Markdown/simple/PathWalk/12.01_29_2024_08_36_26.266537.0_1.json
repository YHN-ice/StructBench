It could refer to the first section after the document title or preamble, or it might mean the first section with content under the main heading.\n\n4. **Formatting Variations**: Different Markdown flavors and custom extensions may have different ways of defining headings (e.g., underlining vs. hashes), which can affect the parsing process.\n\n5. **Link References and Images**: Links and images with alt text containing hashes might be mistaken for headings if not parsed correctly.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Quotes**: Content within code blocks and blockquotes should generally not be treated as headings, even if they contain lines that look like headings.\n\n7. **Comments and HTML**: Some Markdown files may contain HTML comments or tags that could disrupt the parsing if not handled properly.\n\n8. **Incomplete Headings**: A heading might be split across two lines or formatted incorrectly, making it difficult to recognize programmatically.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a precise definition of the \"section\" according to the Markdown file's structure is necessary, along with clear rules on how to handle special cases such as those mentioned above."
