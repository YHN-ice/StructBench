For example, some Markdown flavors allow additional attributes for images, such as size or alignment, which can complicate the pattern you're looking for.\n\n2. **Link vs Image Confusion**: Markdown uses similar syntax for links and images, with images having an exclamation mark before the opening bracket. It's important to ensure that the parser distinguishes between the two.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the exclamation mark (\\!) in Markdown to prevent an image from being rendered. The parser should recognize and ignore escaped image syntax.\n\n4. **Nested Parentheses**: The TARGET part in the syntax might contain parentheses, which can cause issues if the parser is not handling nested parentheses correctly.\n\n5. **Markdown within filenames**: Filenames might contain characters that are also used in Markdown formatting, like underscores or asterisks, which could potentially confuse the parser if it does not handle literals correctly.\n\n6. **Alternative Text Complexity**: The alternative text of the image (inside the brackets) may have different characters that could affect a simple regex. For example, it might contain brackets that would need to be correctly parsed to not confuse the end of the alternative text with the start of the TARGET filename.\n\n7. **Image References**: Markdown allows defining image references elsewhere in the document which could separate the image syntax from its target URL or file path.\n\n8. **File Path Variations**: The TARGET might be a URL, an absolute file path, or a relative file path. Parsing should be robust regardless of the format.\n\n9. **Multiple Images in One Line**: More than one image could be included on a single line, and the parser should be able to extract all of them.\n\n10. **Invalid Syntax**: There might be typos or errors in the Markdown file that lead to invalid image syntax. The parser might need to decide whether to ignore these or report them as errors.\n\n11. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is very large, efficiently parsing it without compromising performance might be a challenge.\n\nKeeping these potential issues in mind will help us develop a robust method for extracting image filenames from the Markdown input file."
