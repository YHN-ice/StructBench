Nested Formatting: Bold text may sometimes be nested inside other formatting elements like italics or code blocks. It will be necessary to make sure that only the correct bold text is extracted and not the formatting around it.\n\n2. Escaped Characters: Markdown users can escape double asterisks to prevent them from being parsed as bold markers. The parser must be able to distinguish between actual bold markers and escaped asterisks.\n\n3. Incorrect Pairs of Asterisks: There might be cases where the asterisks are not correctly paired (having an odd number of asterisk pairs) or are interrupted by line breaks, which could potentially make it difficult to determine the beginning and end of bold text.\n\n4. Overlapping or Adjacent Bold Sections: If there are adjacent bold sections without a clear separator, it could be challenging to determine where one bold section ends, and another begins.\n\n5. Incomplete Markdown Syntax: Sometimes, the Markdown syntax might be incomplete or broken due to typos or editing mistakes, making it difficult to parse the text correctly.\n\n6. Inline Code Blocks: If the text between double asterisks is part of an inline code block, it should not be considered as a bold text.
