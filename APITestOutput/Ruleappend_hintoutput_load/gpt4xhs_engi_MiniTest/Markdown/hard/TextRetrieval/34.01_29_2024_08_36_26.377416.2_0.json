Ensuring that only the bold text is extracted without including formatting characters from nested elements can be challenging.\n\n2. **Escape Characters**: Markdown allows escape characters to prevent formatting, such as `\\**not bold\\**`. Parsing should take escape characters into account so that they are not mistaken for formatting.\n\n3. **Incorrect Pairing**: There might be instances where the double stars are not correctly paired, such as `**bold ** non-bold **`. The parser needs to handle these cases and extract only the correctly formatted bold texts.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines. The parser must be able to handle multiline formatting and extract the text without losing any part of it.\n\n5. **Overlapping Formatting**: If there are overlapping formatting markers, such as `**bold *italic and bold***`, the parser should correctly identify and extract the bold text while handling the overlap with other formatting types.\n\n6. **Literal Double Stars**: Sometimes, double stars might be included in the text as a literal character and not as a formatting marker (e.g., when discussing Markdown syntax). The parser should differentiate between literal usage and formatting usage.\n\n7. **Whitespaces**: There might be whitespace characters between the double stars and the actual bold text (`** bold text **`). The parser needs to trim these whitespaces but maintain those within the bold text itself.\n\nWith these potential issues in mind, I would need to see the input file to provide a precise answer about extracting the bold texts."
