It would be necessary to isolate just the bold text without capturing the nested formatting markers.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax allows for escaping special characters with a backslash (\\\\). An escaped double star (\\\\**) should not be mistaken for the start or end of bold text.\n\n3. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text in Markdown can span across multiple lines. The parser must be able to handle multiline bold sections without stopping at the end of the first line.\n\n4. **Incorrect Pairing**: Users might mistakenly place an odd number of double stars within the document, leading to incorrect pairing for bold text.\n\n5. **Overlapping Syntax**: In Markdown, the same double star syntax is used for both bold and italic text (when single stars are used for italics), so the parser needs to differentiate based on whether there's an even or odd number of stars.\n\n6. **Literals Inside Code Blocks**: Text within code blocks or inline code spans should be treated literally and not parsed for Markdown formatting such as bold text.\n\n7. **Whitespace Handling**: Sometimes whitespace can appear after the opening double stars or before the closing double stars. The parser has to handle these cases correctly.\n\n8. **Intraline Formatting**: The parser must handle cases where bold text starts and ends within a single line, without accidentally capturing text outside the bold markers.\n\n9. **Link Texts**: Bold text might appear within link texts. The parser should not confuse link syntax with bold markers.\n\n10. **List Items and Blockquotes**: Bold text might appear within list items or blockquotes, and the parser needs to consider these contexts while parsing.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, the parser needs to be designed with a robust algorithm that accounts for the context of double stars and handles edge cases effectively."
