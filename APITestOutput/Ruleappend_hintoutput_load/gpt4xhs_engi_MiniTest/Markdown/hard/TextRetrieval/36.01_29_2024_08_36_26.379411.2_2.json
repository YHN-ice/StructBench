For example, spaces might be present between brackets and parentheses, or alternative quotation marks could be used.\n\n2. **Nested Brackets**: If the alt text of the image contains brackets, it may complicate the regex pattern matching process.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: If the image syntax includes escaped characters, such as a backslash before a parenthesis or bracket, the parser must be able to recognize and handle these properly.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The file names could be given as relative paths or absolute paths, and the parser needs to identify and extract these correctly.\n\n5. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There may be multiple images on a single line, and the parser should be able to extract each image file name separately.\n\n6. **Linked Images**: Sometimes, images are linked to other URLs or pages. This can add complexity, as the parser must differentiate between the link target and the image file name.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown parsers support extensions that allow for more complex image embedding (like resizing, classes, etc.). If these extensions are used, the parser must be able to handle this non-standard syntax.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Text that appears to match the pattern but isn't actually an image link (e.g., `![NotAnImage](#just-a-link)`) should be ignored.\n\n9. **Corrupted or Incorrect Syntax**: The document might contain errors or corrupted syntax that could cause incorrect parsing if not handled properly.\n\n10. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is very large with numerous images, performance considerations might need to be taken into account.\n\nTo handle these challenges effectively, a robust regex pattern that accounts for variations and edge cases would be necessary, along with potentially some pre- or post-processing steps to ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
