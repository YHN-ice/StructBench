The main difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of giving the correct answer include:\n\n1. **Identifying Headings Correctly**: Markdown uses `#` symbols to define headings, with the number of `#` symbols indicating the level of the heading (`#` for level 1, `##` for level 2, `###` for level 3, and so on). I need to ensure that I'm accurately identifying the headings and their levels.\n\n2. **Navigating Nested Sections**: Since the question specifies looking into nested sections and sub-sections, I must correctly navigate the hierarchy of headings without getting confused by similar heading levels that are not within the specified path.\n\n3. **Correct Heading Order**: There could be a situation where headings are not in sequential order (e.g., a level 3 heading directly after a level 1 heading). I'll need to handle such cases correctly and not assume a strict hierarchy.\n\n4. **Incomplete or Missing Sections**: The specified section or subsection may not exist if the headings are not properly structured or if there's a typo in the document. I will need to detect this and report that the content is not available.\n\n5. **Formatting Irregularities**: Sometimes, formatting errors (like an extra space before `#`) can cause a heading to not be recognized as such. This could lead to missing the intended section or subsection during parsing.\n\n6. **Content Extraction**: Once the correct section or sub-section is located, I need to extract the content accurately, including any code blocks, lists, or other Markdown elements that may be present.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the Markdown file contains characters with special encodings, it might affect how the content is parsed or displayed.\n\n8. **External references**: Markdown supports links and images which might reference external resources. Since I'm only parsing text, these references will be shown as plain text, and I can't resolve or fetch external content.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, I'll proceed with caution to ensure that I provide the correct excerpt from the Markdown file once it is available for parsing."
