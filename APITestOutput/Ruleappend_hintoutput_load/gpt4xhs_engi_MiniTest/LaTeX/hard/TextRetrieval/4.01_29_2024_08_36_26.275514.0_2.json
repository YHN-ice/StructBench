If they do, they could vary (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, etc.).\n\n4. **Multiple Includes on One Line**: There might be more than one `\\includegraphics` command on a single line.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: The command and its arguments might be split across lines, with or without line continuation characters.\n\n6. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX source could be commented out, meaning some `\\includegraphics` commands might not actually be used in the document.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The LaTeX file could define custom commands or environments that wrap around `\\includegraphics`, which could make it more difficult to parse directly.\n\n8. **Matching Braces**: Ensuring that the parser correctly matches opening and closing braces to extract the correct filename.\n\nAddressing these difficulties would require a robust parsing method, potentially involving regular expressions to handle the variations in how the `\\includegraphics` command is used, and to properly capture the TARGET irrespective of the presence of optional arguments, path information, and line breaks.
