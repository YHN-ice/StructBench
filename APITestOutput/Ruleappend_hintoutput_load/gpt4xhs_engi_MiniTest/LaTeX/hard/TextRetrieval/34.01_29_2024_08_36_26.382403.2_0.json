For example, if we have `\\textbf{\\emph{Bold and Italic}}`, it might be more challenging to extract just the \"Bold and Italic\" part without including the `\\emph{}` command.\n\n2. **Balancing braces**: Since LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to denote the scope of commands, an imbalance in opening and closing braces could lead to incorrect extractions. For instance, `\\textbf{Bold text` without the closing `}` would be problematic.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: If a curly brace is escaped, like `\\}`, it should not be considered as the end of a command. Ensuring that escaped characters are handled correctly is essential.\n\n4. **Multiple bold sections**: There may be multiple `\\textbf{}` commands in a document, and they need to be identified and extracted separately.\n\n5. **Other formatting within bold text**: The bold text itself might contain other formatting or commands that could potentially disrupt a simple extraction process. For instance: `\\textbf{Bold with a footnote\\footnote{example}}`.\n\n6. **Comments and whitespace**: LaTeX allows for comments with `%` which may appear before, after, or within the `\\textbf{}` command, potentially complicating the extraction. Additionally, handling of whitespace and new lines within the LaTeX command needs to be considered.\n\n7. **Non-standard LaTeX packages**: Sometimes, LaTeX files use custom or non-standard packages that redefine or change the behavior of standard commands like `\\textbf{}`. This could affect how the parser interprets and extracts the text.\n\nTo accurately parse and extract bold texts from a LaTeX file, the parser must handle all these issues appropriately."
