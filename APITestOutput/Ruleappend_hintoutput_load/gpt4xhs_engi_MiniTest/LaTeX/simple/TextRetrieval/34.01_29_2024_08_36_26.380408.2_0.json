For example, `\\textbf{bold text with \\emph{emphasis}}` should correctly extract \"bold text with \\emph{emphasis}\".\n\n2. Escaped characters: The parser must correctly handle escaped characters, such as `\\{` or `\\}`, which should not be treated as braces delimiting the argument of `\\textbf`.\n\n3. Concatenated macros: LaTeX syntax allows for macros to be placed next to each other without any separating space. The parser must correctly identify and separate such macros (e.g., `\\textbf{bold}\\textit{italic}`).\n\n4. Comments: LaTeX comments, starting with `%`, may contain what looks like LaTeX commands or braces, but they should be ignored by the parser (e.g., `% this is a comment with \\textbf{not bold}`).\n\n5. Multiple instances: There may be multiple instances of `\\textbf` in the document, and the parser should extract all occurrences.\n\n6. Malformed input: The LaTeX source might contain errors or unconventional use of macros, which could confuse a simple parser.\n\n7. Conditional text: LaTeX can conditionally include text based on certain conditions using `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`, etc. Such conditional text can affect whether the bold text is actually processed or should be included in the output.\n\n8.
