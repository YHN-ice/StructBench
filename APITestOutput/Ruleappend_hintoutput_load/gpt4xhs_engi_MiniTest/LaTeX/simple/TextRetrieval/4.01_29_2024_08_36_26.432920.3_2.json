For example, `\\includegraphics{figures/myfig}`, `\\includegraphics{../images/myfig.jpg}`.\n\n3. **Comments and Disabled Code**: LaTeX comments start with `%` and go until the end of the line. Sometimes figures might be commented out, and therefore shouldn't be included in the list of figure files. Additionally, there could be conditionally included code which may or may not actually result in including the graphic depending on the conditions.\n\n4. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics` but don't look like the standard command at first glance.\n\n5. **Robustness Issues**: LaTeX files can be quite complex and might contain macros or other LaTeX constructs which dynamically generate the filename to be included as a figure.\n\n6. **Nested Brackets**: The `\\includegraphics` command might contain nested brackets within its argument, which makes parsing with simple regular expressions more difficult.\n\nTo deal with these challenges effectively, a parser must be able to handle various command forms, ignore comments and conditional includes, resolve any custom commands or macros if possible, manage nested brackets correctly, and handle file paths correctly, possibly needing to expand them if necessary."
