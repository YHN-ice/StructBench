These options can vary and might be complex, requiring careful parsing to ignore the options and extract only the filename.\n\n2. **Different Path Formats:** The file path can be relative or absolute, and it can use different directory separators (e.g., forward slashes `/` or backslashes `\\` on Windows). The parser must handle these variations to extract the correct filename.\n\n3. **File Extensions:** LaTeX allows omitting the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command, so the parser should recognize filenames both with and without extensions.\n\n4. **Curly Braces:** Filenames are enclosed within curly braces `{}` in the `\\includegraphics` command. Filenames might also contain curly braces, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n5. **Comments and Whitespaces:** The LaTeX file may contain comments (lines starting with `%`) that could include `\\includegraphics` commands, which should be ignored. Additionally, irregular whitespaces and line breaks might be present around the command.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command:** LaTeX provides ways to include multiple figures within a single command, such as using the `subfigure` or `subfloat` packages. These could lead to complex scenarios for parsing.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments:** Some LaTeX documents may define custom commands or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics`. Such usages may not be apparent without expanding those custom definitions.\n\nTo deal with these challenges, a robust parsing approach would involve using regular expressions or a dedicated LaTeX parsing library to accurately identify and extract the filenames, handling the various potential cases appropriately."
