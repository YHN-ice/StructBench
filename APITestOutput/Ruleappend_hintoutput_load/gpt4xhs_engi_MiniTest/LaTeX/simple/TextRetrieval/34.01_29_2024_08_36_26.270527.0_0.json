Balancing braces: LaTeX uses `{}` to group content, but not all `{` are necessarily paired with a `}`. Some might be part of a string or escaped (`\\{`). Ensuring that the parser correctly identifies matching pairs of braces is crucial.\n\n3. Variations in syntax: Users might add spaces or line breaks between `\\textbf` and the `{`, or there might be optional arguments in square brackets before the curly braces. The parser needs to handle these variations to work correctly.\n\n4. Incomplete or malformed commands: There might be typos or errors in the LaTeX source, such as a missing `}` or an extra `{`. The parser should handle these gracefully or report them as errors.\n\n5. Multiple bold sections: The document may contain multiple `\\textbf{}` commands, and the parser should extract the text from each one without mixing them up.\n\n6. Environment conflicts: The `\\textbf` command may be used within different environments, such as within a `\\begin{itemize}` ... `\\end{itemize}` block, and handling environment-specific rules could complicate the parsing.\n\nTo address these issues, robust pattern matching and a clear understanding of the LaTeX syntax are required.
