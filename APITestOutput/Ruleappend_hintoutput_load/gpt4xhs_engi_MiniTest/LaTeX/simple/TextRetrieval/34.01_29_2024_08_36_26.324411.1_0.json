We need to handle these characters properly to avoid incorrect extractions.\n\n3.

Also, the bold texts may be spread across different parts of the document.\n\n4.

Custom macros: The document could define custom macros that change the behavior of `\\textbf`, which would require special handling.\n\n7.

The parser must handle situations where the `\\textbf` command and its associated braces are spread out over multiple lines or separated by comments or white-space.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we will need to handle these potential issues in order to accurately extract all text that is intended to be bold."
