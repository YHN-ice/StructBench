Nested formatting: Bold text might contain other formatting elements like italics, code blocks, or links. We will need to ensure that we only capture the raw text and not any nested Markdown syntax.\n\n2. Escaped characters: Sometimes, the double asterisk (`**`) could be escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means it should not be treated as formatting. We have to handle such cases correctly.\n\n3. Incomplete formatting: There might be cases where the double asterisks are not correctly paired, resulting in incomplete formatting. For example, an odd number of double asterisks without a closing pair might be present.\n\n4. Inline code blocks: Text within inline code blocks (enclosed by backticks) should not be treated as formatted text, even if they contain double asterisks.\n\n5. Multi-line bold text: Bold text can span multiple lines. We need to make sure we capture the entire content, even if it's spread across several lines.\n\n6. Overlapping formatting: There might be overlapping formatting elements, such as bold within another bold section. We need to define how to handle such cases according to Markdown rules.\n\n7. Ambiguity in parsing: Without a standard spec, different implementations of Markdown may handle edge cases differently. Therefore, we need to define clear rules for parsing based on the common usage or a specific flavor of Markdown when faced with ambiguities.\n\nTo resolve these issues, we'll need to carefully process the text, ensuring we correctly identify and extract the bold text segments while accounting for the potential complexities mentioned above."
