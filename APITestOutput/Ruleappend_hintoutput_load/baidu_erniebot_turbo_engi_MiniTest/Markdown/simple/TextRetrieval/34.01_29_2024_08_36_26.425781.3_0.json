        "To extract all bold texts from a Markdown file, you can use a parsing algorithm that is tailored to handle the specific challenges described above. Here's an example of such an algorithm:\n\n1. **Identify bold text boundaries**: Look for double stars (**) as the boundary markers for bold text. When a double star is encountered, scan forward until another double star is found, and mark the start of the bold text at that point.\n2. **Ignore escaped characters**: If an asterisk (*) is preceded by a backslash (\\), it's considered escaped and should be ignored.\n3. **Skip inline and fenced code blocks**: When encountering inline code (enclosed by single backticks) or fenced code blocks (enclosed by triple backticks), skip to the next boundary marker without parsing the text within for formatting tags.\n4. **Ignore unmatched pairs of double stars**: If there are an odd number of double stars, it may indicate an unmatched bold tag. In this case, simply skip to the next boundary marker without processing the text within.\n5. **Separate overlapping or adjacent formatting tags**: If there are adjacent or overlapping formatting tags, determine which one is the most specific and use it to mark the start or end of the bold text.\n6. **Handle multi-line bold text**: When encountering bold text that spans multiple lines, mark the start of the bold text at the first line and scan forward until the end of the bold text is reached.\n7. **Consistency with Markdown flavor**: Use a consistent approach to parsing Markdown regardless of the flavor being used. This may require some knowledge of common Markdown syntax variations.\n8. **Performance considerations**: Implement an efficient algorithm that can handle large Markdown files without slow processing times. This may involve using a data structure like a trie to quickly identify boundary markers or skipping certain text without parsing it for formatting tags.\n\nAfter implementing this algorithm, you can use it to parse a Markdown file and extract all bold texts, separated by newlines (\\n). You can then print those raw texts for further processing or analysis.\n\nNote: This is just an example algorithm to help you tackle the problem at hand. There are many different ways to implement a Markdown parser, and it's possible that other algorithms would work better in your specific situation. Take some time to consider different approaches and choose the one that best fits your needs."
