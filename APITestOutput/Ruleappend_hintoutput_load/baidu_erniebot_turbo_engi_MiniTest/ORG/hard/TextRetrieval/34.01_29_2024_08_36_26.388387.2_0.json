For example, * Heading 1 is a level one heading, and ** Heading 2 is a level two heading.\n\n2. **Lists**: Asterisks can be used to create unordered lists.\n\n3. **Bold text**: As you mentioned, text wrapped in single asterisks is considered bold, and this is what we need to extract.\n\n4. **Other formatting**: Double or triple asterisks can denote italic or bold and italic text, respectively.\n\nThe primary obstacle would be to distinguish between these uses and correctly identify only the bold texts. To do so, we would need to ensure that the text extracted is not part of a heading, list, or other formatting.\n\nAnother possible difficulty could arise from nested formatting or incorrect pairing of asterisks. For instance, if there is a single asterisk within a bold text that was intended for a list item but not closed properly, it might confuse the parser.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, the parser would need to:\n- Ignore asterisks that are part of a heading structure (at the beginning of a line followed by a space).\n- Ignore asterisks that are part of list structures.\n- Consider asterisks that are not followed or preceded by a space or newline as potential bold markers.\n- Ensure that each opening asterisk (*) has a corresponding closing asterisk (*) and they form pairs.\n\nLet me know when you're ready to provide the ORG file content, and I will proceed with the extraction based on these rules."
