This could lead to misunderstanding of the instructions.\n\n7. **Nested Content**: If sub-subsections contain further nested subsections, identifying the correct stopping point for the excerpt can be tricky.\n\n8. **Large Files**: If the ORG file is very large, performance concerns may arise when searching for the appropriate section.\n\n9. **Encoding and Character Sets**: Depending on the character encoding of the file, special characters may not be interpreted correctly.\n\n10. **Access to File Content**: Finally, as an AI, I need to have access to the file or its content to provide an accurate answer.
