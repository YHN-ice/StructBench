Each node's height is determined by finding the maximum subtree height plus 1.

The maximum subtree height is 1 for e and f, so the height of e is 2 (1 + 1).\n* Node g has three children h, j, and k. The maximum subtree height is 2 for g, so the height of g is 3 (2 + 1).\n* Node f has two children l and q, and l has two children m, n, o, and p. The maximum subtree height is 3 for f, so the height of f is 4 (3 + 1).\n* Node e has three children ab, vb, and wb. The maximum subtree height is 4 for e, so the height of e is 5 (4 + 1).\n\nThe root node's height is determined by its subtree with the highest maximum subtree height plus 1.
