Duplicate Keys or Values: If the YAML contains duplicate keys or values, it can be challenging to ensure you are accessing the correct instance.\n\n4. Type Conversions: YAML allows for different data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans), and ensuring the correct type is interpreted while traversing is essential.\n\n5. Recursion: Since you need to perform a recursive search, keeping track of the current path and handling base cases properly is crucial to avoid infinite recursion or missing the target value.\n\n6.
