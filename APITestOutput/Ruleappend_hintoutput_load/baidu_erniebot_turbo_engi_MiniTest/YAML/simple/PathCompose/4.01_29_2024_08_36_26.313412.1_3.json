The requirement is to find the path to a specific occurrence of a value, which means we have to ensure we're referring to the correct instance.\n\n5. **Special Characters in Keys**: If a key contains special characters or spaces, it might need special handling when constructing the path (e.g., quoting or escaping).\n\n6. **Handling Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports aliases and anchors, which can create references to other parts of the document.
