        "The object with id \"c\" is the object at the depth level that contains the key \"id\" with the value \"c\". The content of this object is:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"c\"\nY: v,\n```\nTo find this object, you need to parse the YAML file and traverse its nested structure. Here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Parse the YAML file and get the outermost object.\n2. Start from this object, recursively search for the \"subs\" field and look for the desired value in the \"id\" field for each visited object.\n3. Once you find an object with the desired \"id\" value, retrieve its content.\n\nTo handle the nested structure, you can use a recursive function that traverses the YAML structure depth-first.

If the YAML file is large or deeply nested, you might need to use a more efficient approach to parse it, such as using a streaming parser or pre-processing the data to flatten it into a simpler format."
