Improper indentation: YAML relies on indentation for structure, and using inconsistent or incorrect indentation can lead to parsing errors.\n\n2. Missing colons after keys: In YAML, keys and values are separated by a colon followed by a space. A missing colon can cause a key to be unrecognized.\n\n3. Incorrect use of hyphens in lists: Lists in YAML are denoted by hyphens, but they must be properly indented and used consistently.\n\n4. Unquoted strings with special characters: Strings containing special characters like colons or commas should be quoted, otherwise, they can be misinterpreted by the parser.\n\n5. Duplicate keys: Keys within the same map must be unique; otherwise, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n6. Improper use of quotes: Single and double quotes have specific uses in YAML. For example, double quotes support escape sequences while single quotes do not.\n\n7. Tabs instead of spaces: YAML does not allow tabs for indentation; only spaces are permitted.\n\n8. Syntax errors in nested structures: Complex YAML structures with nested maps and lists can sometimes include syntax errors that are not immediately obvious.\n\nWhile parsing the YAML file, I will specifically look for these types of issues to determine if there are any structural errors."
