This can complicate parsing because the actual data may be located elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Data Types**: Correctly interpreting the types of data (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) is crucial. YAML is very flexible with types and doesn't require explicit type declarations, which can sometimes lead to ambiguities.\n\n4. **Lists and Dictionaries**: YAML allows both lists (sequences) and dictionaries (mappings), and they can be deeply nested within each other. It is important to correctly identify and traverse these structures to find the desired information.\n\n5. **Indents and Formatting**: YAML relies heavily on indentation to define structure. Inconsistent or incorrect indentation could lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n6. **Comments**: YAML supports comments which are not part of the actual data.
