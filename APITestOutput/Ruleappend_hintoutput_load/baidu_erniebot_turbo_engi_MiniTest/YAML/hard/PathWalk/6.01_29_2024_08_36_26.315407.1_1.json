The first element is another object, and its id is the answer.\n\nIn your process of tackle the problem, there are some potential difficulties and latent obstacles for you to notice:\n\n1.

This can complicate parsing as you need to correctly resolve these references.\n\t* Data types: YAML inherently supports various data types like strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, lists, and maps. Ensuring that these are correctly interpreted is crucial.\n\nBased on your input, here's how you can parse the YAML file and find the first object's id of the sub-objects:\n\n1. Load the YAML file into a Python dictionary using a YAML parser library such as PyYAML.\n2. Use a recursive function to traverse the dictionary and find the outermost object.\n3. Inside the recursive function, check if the current object has a `subs` key. If it does, traverse its sub-objects recursively until you find the first one with an `id` key.\n4. The `id` value of the first sub-object is what you're looking for.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Python using PyYAML:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\ndef find_first_object_id(data):\n    # Traverse the dictionary recursively until we find the outermost object\n    while data is not None and 'subs' not in data:\n        data = data['subs']\n    if data is None:\n        return None  # No sub-objects found\n    \n    # Find the first object with an 'id' key in its 'subs' list\n    for sub_object in data:\n        if 'id' in sub_object:\n            return sub_object['id']  # Found the first object's id\n    return None  # No object with an 'id' key found in the sub-objects list\n\n# Load the YAML file into a dictionary\nwith open('your_yaml_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n    \n# Find the first object's id of the sub-objects\nfirst_object_id = find_first_object_id(data)\nprint(first_object_id)  # Output: s or t or u or v or w or x or y or z or ab or bb or cb or db or eb or fb or gb\n```\nMake sure to replace `'your_yaml_file.yaml'` with your actual YAML file path.
