Handling these recursive references to avoid infinite loops during parsing can be tricky.\n\n4. **Multiple Objects with Same id**: If the YAML file contains multiple objects with the same id (though it should not ideally be the case for unique identifiers), it would need to be determined which object's content should be returned or if all matching objects' content should be provided.\n\n5. **Performance Issues**: For very large files, performance can become an issue.
