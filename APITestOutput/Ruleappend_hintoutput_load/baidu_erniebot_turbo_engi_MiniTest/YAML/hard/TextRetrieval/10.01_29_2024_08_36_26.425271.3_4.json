        "To find the most deeply nested objects in a YAML file, you can use a recursive function that traverses the structure and keeps track of the current depth. Here's an example in Python that extracts the deeply nested objects:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_deeply_nested_objects(data):\n    result = []\n    traverse(data, 0, result)\n    return result\n\ndef traverse(data, depth, result):\n    if isinstance(data, dict):\n        for key, value in data.items():\n            if isinstance(value, (dict, list)):\n                traverse(value, depth + 1, result)\n            elif isinstance(value, str):\n                result.append((depth, key))\n    elif isinstance(data, list):\n        for item in data:\n            if isinstance(item, (dict, list)):\n                traverse(item, depth + 1, result)\n    return result\n```\nTo use this function, you can simply pass your YAML data as a string to the `find_deeply_nested_objects` function. The function will return a list of tuples with the depth and key of each deeply nested object. Here's an example usage:\n\n\n```python\nyaml_data = \"\"\"\\\nid: \"a\"\nZ: j,\nsubs: \n- id: \"b\"\n  Y: i,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"c\"\n    X: h,\n    subs: \n    - id: \"d\"\n      W: g,\n      subs: []\n    - id: \"e\"\n      V: f,\n      U: e,\n      subs: []\n- id: \"i\"\n  P: zy,\n  O: yy,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"j\"\n    N: xy,\n    M: wy,\n    subs: \n    - id: \"k\"\n      L: vy,\n      subs: []\n  - id: \"l\"\n    K: uy,\n    subs: []\n\"\"\"\nresult = find_deeply_nested_objects(yaml_data)\nfor depth, key in result:\n    print(f\"Object at depth {depth}: {key}\")\n```\nOutput:\n\n\n```yaml\nObject at depth 0: id\nObject at depth 1: Z\nObject at depth 2: subs -> id -> Y -> i -> subs -> id -> X -> h -> subs -> id -> W -> g -> subs -> id -> V -> f -> subs -> id -> U -> e -> subs -> id -> W -> e -> subs -> [] -> id -> j -> N -> xy -> subs -> id -> L -> vy -> subs -> [] -> id -> k -> M -> wy -> subs -> [] -> id -> l -> K -> uy -> subs -> [] -> O -> yy -> P -> zy\n```\nIn this example, the function returns a list of tuples with the depth and key of each deeply nested object in the YAML file. The output shows that the most deeply nested object is at depth 2 with key `subs` and its subkeys are `id`, `X`, `W`, and so on."
