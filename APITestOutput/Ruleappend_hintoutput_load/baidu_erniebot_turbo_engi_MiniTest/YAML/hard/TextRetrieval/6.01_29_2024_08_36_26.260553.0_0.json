        "The object with id \"c\" is the object in the following YAML snippet:\n\n\n```yaml\nsubs: \n- id: \"c\"\n  W: yy,\n```\nThis object has a `subs` field that contains a list of objects with `id` and `W` fields. The `id` field of the innermost object is \"c\", and the `W` field is \"yy\".\n\nWhen parsing a YAML file, it is important to follow a robust and efficient search strategy to retrieve the desired object once it is found. Here are some strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Use a recursive function or method:** A recursive function or method can be used to search through the nested objects in the YAML file. This function or method should take into account the outermost object, then recursively search through the `subs` field of each visited object for the desired `id`.\n2. **Check for duplicates:** If there are objects with duplicate ids, the parser should have a strategy for handling this ambiguity.
