        "To calculate the number of people who work in IL and are taller than 175 cm, you need to join the two tables on the primeKey column and then count the number of rows that meet both conditions. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open the two tables in your preferred database tool or program (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or MySQL Workbench).\n2. Perform a left join between the two tables on the primeKey column. This will join the two tables based on the same person being present in both tables.\n3. Filter the joined table by checking the height column and only selecting rows where the height is greater than 175 cm.\n4. Count the number of rows in the filtered table to get the total number of people who work in IL and are taller than 175 cm.\n\nIn your case, you have provided the input data in a text format, so it's not possible to use a database tool or program directly. However, you can manually perform these steps using a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the number of tall people who work in IL:\n\n1. In the first table (table with primeKey, gender, age, name, height, weight, and color), count the number of rows where the height is greater than 175 cm. You can do this by summing up the height values greater than 175 cm (e.g., 176, 177, ..., 222).\n2. Then, perform a left join between the two tables based on their primeKey column and filter the result based on company column and city column to check if they are working in IL.\n3. Count the total number of rows that meet both conditions (working in IL and height greater than 175 cm).\n\nBased on your provided input data, here's how you can calculate the number of tall people who work in IL:\n\nPrimeKey | gender | age | name | height | weight | color | company | location\n------ | ------ | ---- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | -------\na      | male   | 53   | w    | 176    | 174    | brown  | Twitter | HI\ne      | female | 50   | ab   | 175    | 146    | olive  | NVIDIA  | CA\nTotal tall people who work in IL: 2\n\nNote: The height values provided in your input data are not consistent across rows, so it's not possible to calculate an accurate height range for each person. Therefore, I've used the maximum height value (222 cm) for simplicity. If you have consistent height values across rows, you can use those instead."
