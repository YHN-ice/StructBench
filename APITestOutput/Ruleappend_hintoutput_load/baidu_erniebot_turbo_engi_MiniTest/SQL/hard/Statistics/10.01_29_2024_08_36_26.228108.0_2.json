This could lead to an undercount if not accounted for.\n\n4. **Duplicate Rows**: If rows with the same primeKey indicate the same person, duplicates must be filtered out to avoid overcounting.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity**: The gender field might be case-sensitive, so 'female' and 'Female' would be considered different if not accounted for.\n\n6. **Column Identification**: If the column names are not standardized or there is a typo in the column name that should contain gender data ('' in your instructions seems like a placeholder), it could be challenging to locate the correct column.\n\n7. **Data Format**: The format of the data (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.) can also affect how we parse the data.
