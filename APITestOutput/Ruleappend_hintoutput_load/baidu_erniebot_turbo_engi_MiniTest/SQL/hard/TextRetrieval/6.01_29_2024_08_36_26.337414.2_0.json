Large Data Sets: If the data table is very large, it might be difficult to quickly locate the primeKey without search functionality or proper indexing.\n\n2. Duplicate Prime Keys: If there are duplicate prime keys within the data set, it may be unclear which record to reference unless additional context is provided.\n\n3. Inconsistent Formatting: Inconsistent data formatting or typos in the primeKey can make it difficult to match the key correctly.\n\n4. Multiple Tables: If the information is spread across multiple tables, one must ensure they are looking at the correct table or join the tables correctly.\n\n5. Missing Data: The desired field for a given primeKey might be missing or empty, which would require handling for incomplete data.\n\n6. Data Type Mismatch: The field being requested could be stored in a different data type than expected (e.g., age might be stored as a string instead of an integer), potentially leading to parsing errors.\n\n7. Ambiguous Columns: Columns with similar or vague names may cause confusion about which contains the desired data.\n\n8. Case Sensitivity: The primeKey could be case-sensitive, which means that 'C' is different from 'c', and thus one must be careful with the capitalization when searching for the key.\n\n9. Data Privacy and Access Control: The data might have restrictions for access, and sensitive information needs to be handled according to privacy regulations.\n\nThese challenges necessitate careful consideration when designing a parser or while manually looking up information. Strategies to overcome these obstacles include using software with robust search capabilities, establishing clear data entry standards, double-checking for data consistency, and handling edge cases in data processing scripts."
