Inconsistent Data Formats: The data in each table might be formatted differently, which may require normalization to enable proper comparison and joining.\n\n2. Missing or Duplicate Entries: Some entries might be missing crucial information, such as the primeKey, which is necessary for joining tables. Additionally, there might be duplicate entries for the same individual that need to be handled.\n\n3. Data Quality Issues: The tables might contain errors such as incorrect heights or city names, which could lead to inaccurate results.\n\n4. Large Datasets: If the tables are very large, the performance of the joining operation and subsequent filtering may be a concern and might require optimization techniques.\n\n5. Complex Join Conditions: Depending on the structure of the tables, the join conditions may be complex, particularly if there are many-to-many relationships or if additional processing is required to determine matches.\n\n6. Handling Null Values: Some rows may have null or empty values for important fields like height or city, which need to be considered when applying filters.\n\n7. Case Sensitivity: The city names might have case sensitivity issues (e.g., \"IL\" vs \"il\"), requiring normalization to ensure accurate filtering.\n\n8. Data Type Mismatches: Fields like height may not always be stored as numeric values, potentially requiring conversion before comparison.\n\n9. Ambiguous City Abbreviations: If cities are referred to by abbreviations (e.g., \"IL\"), it needs to be clear which specific city or state is referred to, as abbreviations might be shared by multiple locations.\n\n10. Overlapping Data: If individuals have multiple entries across tables with different information (like different heights), it needs to be determined which entry should take precedence.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help in preparing for the necessary steps in data preprocessing, joining, and analysis to ensure an accurate answer to your question.
