        "To answer this question, you need to join the two tables based on the primeKey, and then count the number of people who are taller than 180 cm.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Select all rows from table 1 and table 2 based on the primeKey.\n\n\n```sql\nSELECT table1.*, table2.* FROM table1\nJOIN table2 ON table1.primeKey = table2.primeKey\n```\n2. Filter out the rows where gender is female and age is less than 18.\n\n\n```sql\nWHERE table1.gender = 'male' AND table1.age >= 18\n```\n3. Filter out rows where height is less than or equal to 180 cm.\n\n\n```sql\nWHERE table1.height > 180\n```\n4. Count the number of rows that satisfy all these conditions.\n\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM (your previous query) as t\n```\nThe final query will give you the number of male people who are taller than 180 cm and work in CA. If you need the count for all people regardless of gender, you can replace \"male\" with \"female\" in the filtering criteria and subtract the count for female people from the total count.\n\nThe resulting count will give you the answer to your question.\n\nIn terms of obstacles and potential pitfalls, you mentioned some things to keep in mind:\n\n* Inconsistent or Missing Data: Make sure to preprocess and clean the data before joining to avoid any discrepancies or missing information.\n* Data Format Differences: Standardize the data format before joining to avoid any confusion or mismatches.\n* Large Datasets: Use efficient data processing techniques to handle large datasets, especially if they have duplicate records or other complexities.\n* Duplicate Records: Ensure that duplicate records are handled appropriately to avoid skewing the results.\n* Data Type Mismatches: If there are mismatches between the data types for the fields to be joined on, perform type conversions to avoid issues.\n* Join Complexity: Depending on the structure of the data, performing a join may require more effort or processing time.
