Unclosed Tags: If a tag is not properly closed with a '>' symbol, it would result in an error.\n\n3. Improper Nesting: Tags should be properly nested within each other. For example, if a 'child' tag is closed before its 'parent', this would be a structural error.\n\n4. Special Characters: XML has some special characters like '<' and '&'. If these characters are used within the text, they should be escaped using entities (e.g., &lt; for '<').\n\n5. Attribute Syntax: Errors can occur if attributes are not properly quoted or if there is an equal sign missing between the attribute name and its value.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: XML tags are case-sensitive. A mismatch in case between opening and closing tags would result in an error.\n\n7. Duplicated Attributes: An element can't have two attributes with the same name.\n\nOnce I see the XML content, I will be able to determine if any of these common issues, or others, are present.
