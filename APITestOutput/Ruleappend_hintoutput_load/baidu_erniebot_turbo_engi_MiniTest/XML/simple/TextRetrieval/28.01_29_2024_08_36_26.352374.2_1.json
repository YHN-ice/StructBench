        "The XML file contains multiple tags with the attribute \"zy\" with different values. You can use an XML parser to find the tag with the desired attribute value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Load the XML file into a variable using an appropriate XML parser library, such as Python's xml.etree.ElementTree module.\n2. Use a loop to iterate through all tags in the XML file, checking each tag for the attribute \"zy\" with the desired value.\n3. If a tag with the desired attribute value is found, extract the tag name from the surrounding angle brackets (e.g., \"<tagname>\") and return the tag name.\n\nHere's an example in Python using the xml.etree.ElementTree module:\n\n\n```python\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\n# Load XML file into a variable\nxml_content = \"\"\"...your XML content here...\"\"\"\nroot = ET.fromstring(xml_content)\n\n# Iterate through all tags in the XML file\nfor child in root:\n    # Check if the tag has the attribute \"zy\" with the desired value\n    if child.attrib['zy'] == 'your_desired_value':\n        # Extract the tag name from the surrounding angle brackets\n        tag_name = child.tag\n        print(\"Found tag with attribute 'zy' with value 'your_desired_value':\", tag_name)\n```\nReplace \"your_desired_value\" with the desired attribute value and you should get the tag name that matches the attribute value. Please note that this is just a basic example and assumes that the XML file is well-formed and contains only one occurrence of the desired attribute value per tag. If your XML file contains more complex structures or errors, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."
