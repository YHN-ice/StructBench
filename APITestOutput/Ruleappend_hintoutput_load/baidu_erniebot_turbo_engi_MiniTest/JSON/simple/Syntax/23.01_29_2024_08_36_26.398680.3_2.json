Unquoted keys or strings: In JSON, all keys must be within double quotes, and string values must also be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Improper nesting of objects and arrays: Objects (`{}`) and arrays (`[]`) must be properly opened and closed, with the correct hierarchical structure.\n\n4. Data type errors: Values must be of an appropriate data type (string, number, object, array, true/false, or null).\n\n5. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages that may allow it, JSON does not permit a trailing comma after the last element in an array or the last key-value pair in an object.\n\n6. Syntax errors: Any deviation from the standard JSON syntax rules, such as missing ending curly braces or square brackets, can cause parsing errors.\n\nLet's now see the JSON file content to determine whether it contains any structural errors.
