Efficiently traversing and extracting the required objects without unnecessary processing is important to ensure timely responses.\n\n7. **Keeping Track of Excerpts**: As the requirement is to return excerpts as they appear in the JSON file, we must ensure that the formatting and content are preserved exactly as they are in the original file when returning results.\n\n8. **Handling Errors and Edge Cases**: The presence of unexpected data types, malformed JSON, or unusual structures within the JSON file can lead to errors or edge cases that need to be handled gracefully.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a careful approach to parsing, including thorough traversal of the JSON structure while maintaining state information and handling various data types appropriately."
