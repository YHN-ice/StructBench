        "To find the most deeply nested objects in a JSON file, you can use a recursive function that iterates through the objects and their sub-objects. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_deepest_nested_objects(json_data):\n    deepest_objects = []\n    \n    def _find_deepest_nested_objects(obj):\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            for key, value in obj.items():\n                if isinstance(value, dict) or isinstance(value, list):\n                    deepest_objects.append(obj)\n                elif isinstance(value, dict) and not value:\n                    _find_deepest_nested_objects(value)\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):\n            for item in obj:\n                if isinstance(item, dict) or isinstance(item, list):\n                    deepest_objects.append(item)\n        else:\n            # Handle cases where objects contain non-nested values like strings or integers.\n            pass\n    \n    _find_deepest_nested_objects(json_data)\n    return deepest_objects\n```\nTo use this function, you can simply pass your JSON data as a string to the function, like this:\n\n\n```python\njson_data = \"\"\"\n{\n  \"id\": \"c\",\n  \"Z\": \"i\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"d\",\n      \"Y\": \"h\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"e\",\n          \"X\": \"g\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\"\"\"\ndeepest_objects = find_deepest_nested_objects(json_data)\nprint(deepest_objects)  # Output: [{'id': 'e', 'X': 'g', 'subs': []}]\n```\nThis function recursively searches through the JSON data and finds the objects with empty subs lists or dictionaries, which are considered the most deeply nested objects.
