Making sure that the id fields are compared with the correct type (usually a string) is important.\n\n5. **Error Handling:** The JSON file could have errors or might not be well-formed, which would result in parsing errors.\n\n6. **Performance:** Depending on the size of the JSON and the complexity of its structure, performance could be an issue. Effective recursive search algorithms would be needed to ensure timely retrieval of data.\n\n7. **Case Sensitivity:** JSON keys are case-sensitive, so searching for 'p' is different from searching for 'P'.
