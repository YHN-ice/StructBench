If the file is not provided, cannot be opened, or is corrupt, parsing cannot proceed.\n\n2. **Format Validity**: The JSON file must be well-formed. If there are syntax errors such as missing commas, brackets, or quotation marks, the parsing will fail.\n\n3. **Data Structure Complexity**: Depending on the structure of the JSON, navigating to the correct element could be challenging. If there are nested objects or arrays, it is important to understand the hierarchy to locate the 'subs' list and its first element.\n\n4. **Key Names**: The exact key names need to be known. If the key for the list of objects is not 'subs' or if the ID field is named differently (e.g., 'identifier' instead of 'id'), it would be necessary to adjust the query accordingly.\n\n5. **Empty or Missing Data**: The 'subs' list may be empty or not exist at all. If that's the case, there wouldn't be a first object or an id to retrieve.\n\n6. **Data Types**: It is important to ensure that the data types are as expected. For example, if 'id' is supposed to be a string but is found as a different type (like an integer), this may require additional handling.\n\n7. **Programming Language and Libraries**: Depending on the programming language and libraries used to parse the JSON file, there may be specific nuances in how the data is accessed.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we would ensure that the JSON file is accessible and well-formed, understand its structure, use appropriate keys to access data, handle empty or missing data gracefully, validate data types, and use the appropriate language features or libraries for parsing.\n\nNow that we have discussed potential obstacles, you can provide the JSON file for parsing, and I will proceed with retrieving the first object's id from the 'subs' list."
