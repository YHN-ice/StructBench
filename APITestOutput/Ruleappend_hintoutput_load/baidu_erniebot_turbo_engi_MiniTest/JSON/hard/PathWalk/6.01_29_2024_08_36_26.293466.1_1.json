Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might occur when parsing a JSON file to find the first object's `id` in a `subs` list:\n\n1. **Invalid JSON format**: If the JSON file is not properly formatted, parsing might fail. JSON has strict syntax rules, such as requiring double quotes around keys and string values, and using commas to separate items in lists and objects.\n\n2. **Large file size**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be difficult to process it efficiently. Large files require more memory and processing power.\n\n3. **Nested structure complexity**: If the JSON file has a deeply nested structure, navigating to the correct element to retrieve the `id` might be complex.\n\n4. **Missing key 'subs'**: The expected key `subs` might not exist in the JSON structure, which would make it impossible to retrieve the first object's `id`.\n\n5. **Empty 'subs' list**: The `subs` list might be empty, which means there would be no object to retrieve an `id` from.\n\n6. **'id' not present**: The first object in the `subs` list might not have an `id` property, which would mean there's no `id` to retrieve.\n\n7. **Data type inconsistencies**: The `id` value might not be a string or number as expected, but another data type like an object or array, which could complicate the retrieval.\n\n8. **Multiple 'subs' keys**: If there are multiple `subs` keys at different levels of nesting, it may be unclear which one should be used to find the first object's `id`.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful error checking and handling would be necessary when writing a JSON parser. Since I can't interact with actual files, you will need to provide the JSON content so I can analyze its structure and help you find the first object's `id` within the `subs` list."
