Determining which object's content is desired could be problematic.\n\n4. **Variations in Format**: JSON keys and structure can vary. The \"id\" field might not always be at the same level or could be named inconsistently across objects (e.g., \"ID\", \"Id\", or \"id\").\n\n5. **Data Types**: The content of the object could be of any data type (string, number, object, array, etc.). Ensuring that the parser can handle all types and return the content correctly is essential.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains non-standard encodings or special characters, these might cause issues during parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is necessary to deal with missing fields, unexpected data types, or malformed JSON.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust JSON parsing algorithm or library will be required that can handle nested structures, ensure efficient searching, manage memory usage effectively, deal with different data types, and include proper error handling mechanisms."
