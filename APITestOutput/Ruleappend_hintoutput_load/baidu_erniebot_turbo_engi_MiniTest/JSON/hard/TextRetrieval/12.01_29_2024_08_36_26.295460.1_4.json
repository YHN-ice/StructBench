There may be inconsistencies in how deeply nested objects are represented, or there may be different fields that indicate nesting that are not standardized across the file.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it could be difficult to parse it efficiently without running into memory or performance issues.\n\n5. **Extracting and Presenting Data**: Once the terminal objects are identified, I need to extract them and present them in the format specified, separated by `\\n\\n`.
