A common mistake is to forget to include a comma between elements.\n\n2. **Extra Commas:** Conversely, having an extra comma at the end of a list of elements or key-value pairs (commonly known as a trailing comma) is not allowed in JSON, even though some programming languages permit it.\n\n3. **Mismatched Braces and Brackets:** Every opening curly brace `{` or square bracket `[` must be matched with a closing curly brace `}` or square bracket `]`. Unmatched or incorrectly nested braces can cause structural errors.\n\n4. **Incorrect Data Types:** JSON supports specific data types such as string (enclosed in double quotes), number, object, array, boolean (`true` or `false`), and `null`. Using incorrect or unsupported data types can lead to errors.\n\n5. **Improper String Formatting:** Strings in JSON must be enclosed in double quotes. Using single quotes or no quotes at all can cause errors.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues:** JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8. If the file contains characters not encoded properly, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **BOM (Byte Order Mark):** A BOM could be present at the beginning of a UTF-8 encoded file, which could cause issues when parsing the JSON.\n\n8. **Comments:** Standard JSON does not support comments. Including comments in the file will result in a parsing error.\n\nTo identify structural errors, I would need to systematically check for these common issues. However, since I cannot actually \"parse\" in the way software would, I can only provide guidance on what to look for when checking for JSON structural integrity. Please provide the JSON content you'd like to validate, and I can help you determine if there are any structural issues based on the rules outlined above."
