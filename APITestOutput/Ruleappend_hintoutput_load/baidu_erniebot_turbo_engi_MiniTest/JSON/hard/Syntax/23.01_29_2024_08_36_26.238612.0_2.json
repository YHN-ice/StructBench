Missing or mismatched brackets can lead to errors.\n\n2. **Comma Issues**: In JSON, commas are used to separate key-value pairs within an object and elements within an array. Extra or missing commas can lead to parsing errors.\n\n3. **Key-Value Pair Syntax**: Each key must be a string (enclosed in double quotes) followed by a colon and then its value. Errors can occur if the keys are not properly quoted or if the colon is missing.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings (in double quotes), numbers, objects, arrays, booleans (true/false), and null. Mistakes in data type representation can cause errors.\n\n5. **String Enclosure**: All strings must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes or unquoted strings are not valid.\n\n6. **Trailing Commas**: While some languages allow trailing commas in lists or objects, JSON does not permit this, which could lead to errors.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text must be properly encoded. It is generally encoded in UTF-8.\n\n8. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments. Including them will cause parsing errors.\n\n9. **Scalability**: If the JSON file is large, it might be challenging to visually inspect and detect errors; automated tools would be required.\n\n10. **Depth and Complexity**: Deeply nested objects or arrays can make it difficult to track the proper nesting and closure of brackets.\n\n11. **Human Error**: When editing JSON files manually, it's easy to introduce errors inadvertently.\n\nTo identify structural errors effectively, a parser must check all these aspects thoroughly. If you provide the JSON content, I can proceed to check for any structural errors."
