These options may include scaling, rotation, and other parameters that could complicate the search pattern.\n\n2. **Different file path formats**: The filenames may include relative or absolute paths, and may be nested within directories. Additionally, the filenames might not include file extensions, as LaTeX is capable of defaulting to common extensions (.png, .jpg, .eps, etc.) when omitted.\n\n3. **Comments and line breaks**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. If a line with an `\\includegraphics` command is commented out or broken across multiple lines, it could make pattern matching more challenging.\n\n4. **Custom commands and environments**: The document may define custom commands or environments that include graphics indirectly, making it non-trivial to find the image files without expanding these commands.\n\n5. **Multiple includegraphics on one line**: There could be multiple `\\includegraphics` commands on a single line, which would require that the search pattern recognizes and extracts each file separately.\n\n6. **Starred version of \\includegraphics**: The starred version (`\\includegraphics*`) might behave differently, although usually, it just clips the image to its natural size.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser will need to be robust enough to account for various command formats and able to ignore commented lines while correctly identifying and extracting filenames from the `\\includegraphics` command."
