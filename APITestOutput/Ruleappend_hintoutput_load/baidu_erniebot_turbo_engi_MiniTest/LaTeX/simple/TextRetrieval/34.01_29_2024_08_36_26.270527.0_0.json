If there are extra or missing braces, it may lead to incorrect extraction of the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Characters such as backslashes `\\` and curly braces `{}` might be escaped (e.g., `\\\\{`), which would mean they are not actual command indicators but rather literal text. Parsing logic must distinguish between these cases.\n\n4. **Multiple Bold Sections**: If there are multiple `\\\\textbf{}` macros in the input, the parser needs to correctly identify and separate each bold section.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Bold text might span multiple lines or contain significant whitespace, which must be accounted for in the parser.\n\n6. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using `%`. These comments could potentially contain `\\\\textbf{}`, which should not be considered part of the actual content.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might have formatted their LaTeX files inconsistently, with variations in spacing or line breaks around commands that can add complexity to the parsing process.\n\nTo successfully extract all bold texts, the parser must be capable of handling these situations appropriately."
