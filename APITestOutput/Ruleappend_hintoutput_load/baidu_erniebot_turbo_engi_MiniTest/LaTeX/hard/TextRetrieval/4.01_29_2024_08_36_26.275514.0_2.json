The parser should be able to extract the correct filename regardless of the path complexity.\n\n3. **File extensions omission**:\n   LaTeX allows for omitting the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command. The parser should identify filenames with or without extensions.\n\n4. **Multiple files in one command**:\n   While not standard, there might be custom commands or LaTeX packages that allow for including multiple files within one `\\includegraphics` command, separated by commas or other delimiters. This is a less common scenario but something to be aware of.\n\n5. **Comments and whitespace**:\n   Lines in LaTeX files can be commented out using the `%` symbol, and any text following this symbol on the same line is considered a comment. The parser should ignore commented lines. Additionally, LaTeX is generally whitespace-insensitive, so the parser must handle variable amounts of whitespace.\n\n6. **Complex LaTeX commands**:\n   If the LaTeX document defines new commands that internally use `\\includegraphics`, the parser would need to recognize these as well.\n\n7. **Enclosed within other environments**:\n   Sometimes, the `\\includegraphics` command might be nested within other LaTeX environments or custom commands, which could affect the parsing if not handled properly.\n\n8. **Non-standard macros or packages**:\n   If the LaTeX file uses custom macros or includes additional packages that change the behavior of `\\includegraphics`, this could complicate extraction.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, let's proceed with examining the input file to accurately extract all included figure filenames."
