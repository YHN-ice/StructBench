For example, heights might be in different units, or city names might have spelling variations.\n\n3. Missing Data: Some entries might have missing information for either city or height, which would necessitate a decision on how to handle incomplete records.\n\n4.

For example, height might be stored as a string in one table and needs to be converted to an integer or float for comparison.\n\n5.

Case Sensitivity: City names might be case-sensitive, which could lead to missing out on some records if not standardized.\n\n7. Joins on Non-unique Keys: The `primeKey` must be unique for each individual across tables; otherwise, joining on non-unique keys could result in incorrect associations.\n\n8. Multiple Entries for One Person: An individual could have multiple entries if they have changed cities or if their height has been recorded multiple times. This requires deduplication based on the `primeKey`.\n\n9.
