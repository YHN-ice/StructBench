Data Formatting: The data tables must be well-formatted and consistent. Inconsistencies in formatting could lead to difficulties in joining the tables on the `primeKey`.\n\n2. Correctness and Completeness: The data provided in both tables should be accurate and complete. Missing or incorrect data could affect the accuracy of the final count.\n\n3. Data Types: The data types for each field (such as height and state) should be appropriate for comparison. For example, heights should be numerical to allow for greater than/less than comparisons.\n\n4. Joining Tables: The tables need to be correctly joined on the `primeKey`. A failure to properly join the tables could lead to incorrect data being compared.\n\n5. Duplicates: It's important to ensure that the join does not create duplicate records for the same individual or that if duplicates are present due to different entries related to the same person, they are handled correctly.\n\n6. Filtering Criteria: Once joined, I will need to correctly apply the filtering criteria (working in IL and being taller than 175 cm) to identify the relevant individuals.\n\n7. Performance Issues: Depending on the size of the data sets, there might be performance considerations when joining and filtering large tables. Ensuring an efficient querying process might be necessary for very large datasets.\n\n8. Data Privacy and Ethics: There may be privacy concerns with using personal data, such as heights and work locations, so it's important to ensure that any analysis complies with relevant laws and ethical standards.\n\nPlease provide me with the data tables or information necessary to complete this request, and I will proceed with processing the data to answer your question."
