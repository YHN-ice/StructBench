For example, some salaries might be inputted with commas, decimal points, or currency symbols that need to be accounted for before comparisons can be made.\n\n4. **Missing Data**: There may be missing or incomplete data entries for some individuals. You would need to decide whether to exclude these entries from the count or handle them differently.\n\n5. **Data Types**: The salary information could be stored as strings instead of numbers, requiring conversion before comparison can be performed.\n\n6. **Large Data Sets**: If the table is very large, performance considerations might come into play when counting the number of people.\n\n7. **Incorrect Data**: Human error or system errors could lead to incorrect data being entered, which might lead to inaccurate counts if not validated or cleaned up.\n\n8. **Updates and Synchronization**: The data may be updated frequently, and ensuring you are working with the most up-to-date information might be challenging.\n\n9. **Complexity of PrimeKeys**: If primeKeys are complex or not easy to interpret, it could make the process of ensuring you are not double-counting individuals more difficult.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, careful data validation, cleaning, and possibly deduplication processes would need to be in place.
