You would need to normalize these values to make a fair comparison.\n\n3. **Data Duplication**: If the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, then it is possible that a person's salary is listed more than once. Care should be taken not to count a person's salary multiple times.\n\n4. **Data Errors**: There may be errors in the data, such as typographical mistakes or incorrect values, which could lead to inaccurate results.\n\n5. **Sorting and Filtering**: The table may not be sorted by salary, so you would need to implement a method for filtering out salaries that do not meet the threshold.\n\n6. **Missing Data**: Some rows might have missing salary information, in which case, you'll need to decide whether to ignore such rows or handle them in some other way.\n\n7. **Data Types**: The salary field might not always be a numeric type which can be directly compared; it may be stored as text that requires conversion before comparison.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the dataset is large, the process of going through each line can be time-consuming, and optimizing the search might be necessary.\n\n9. **Complex Data Structures**: The data might not be flat and could contain nested structures that need to be parsed appropriately to extract the salary information.\n\n10. **Accessing the Data**: If the data is in a file, there may be issues with file access permissions or file corruption that could prevent you from reading the data accurately.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file, I can apply appropriate strategies to account for these potential issues and correctly determine the number of people with a salary above the specified threshold."
