Special characters: LaTeX uses special characters such as backslashes, curly braces, and percent signs for its syntax. These need to be correctly interpreted and not mistaken for regular text.\n\n3. Variations in syntax: The `\\textbf` macro might be used with optional arguments or in different environments, which could affect the straightforward search for `\\textbf{...}`.\n\n4. Multiple bold sections in a single command: There might be cases where `\\textbf` is used with concatenated arguments, like `\\textbf{Bold1}\\textbf{Bold2}`, which should be treated as separate bold texts.\n\n5. Escaped braces: In LaTeX, braces can be escaped to be included as part of the text.
