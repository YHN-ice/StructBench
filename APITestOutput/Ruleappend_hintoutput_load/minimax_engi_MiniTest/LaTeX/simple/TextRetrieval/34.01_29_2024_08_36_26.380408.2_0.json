Nested commands: LaTeX allows for commands and environments to be nested within each other, which may complicate the extraction process. For instance, a bold command inside another formatting command like italics or underline could make it difficult to extract just the bold text.\n\n2. Variants of the \\\\textbf command: LaTeX is highly flexible and there are multiple ways to make text bold, such as using the \\\\bf command (deprecated) or through custom commands defined by the user that internally use \\\\textbf. These variants might be missed if we only look for \\\\textbf.\n\n3. Special characters: Special characters in LaTeX, such as curly braces, percentage signs, dollar signs, etc., have special meanings and must be parsed correctly to extract the desired text.\n\n4. Commented out text: Text that is commented out with a % character should not be included in the output, as it is not meant to be processed by LaTeX.\n\n5. Incomplete or malformed commands: An incomplete \\\\textbf command or typos might result in incorrect parsing if the parser does not account for such errors.\n\n6. Environment conflicts: The \\\\textbf command may behave differently within different environments (such as math mode versus text mode), which could affect how text should be extracted.\n\n7. Variability in file encoding: Different LaTeX files may use different encodings, which could affect how text is read and parsed by the program.\n\n8. Conditionals and custom commands: LaTeX allows for conditionals and user-defined macros, which can change how standard commands like \\\\textbf behave. Without executing these conditionals and macros, extracting the correct text might be challenging.\n\n9. Line breaks and white spaces: In LaTeX, line breaks and white spaces can be used in flexible ways, which might make it difficult to identify where a command starts and ends without a proper parsing strategy.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust LaTeX parser would need to have a strategy for handling nested structures, be aware of variants and custom commands, manage special characters appropriately, ignore commented text, handle different environments correctly, deal with file encodings, execute conditionals when necessary, and normalize white spaces and line breaks."
