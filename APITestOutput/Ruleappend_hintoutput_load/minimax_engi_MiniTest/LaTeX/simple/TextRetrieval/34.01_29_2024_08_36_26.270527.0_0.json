They might be present inside the `\\textbf{}` command and need to be interpreted or escaped properly.\n\n3. **Line breaks and comments**: LaTeX ignores line breaks and treats comments (anything after a `%` on a line) as non-existent. Therefore, a `\\textbf{}` command may span multiple lines or have comments within it.\n\n4. **Alternative bold commands**: Besides `\\textbf{}`, there could be other commands in LaTeX that make text bold, such as `\\bfseries`.
