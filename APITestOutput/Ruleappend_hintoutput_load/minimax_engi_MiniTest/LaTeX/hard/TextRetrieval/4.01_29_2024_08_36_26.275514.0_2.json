The `\\includegraphics` command itself might have optional arguments that can change the way the command is parsed.\n\n2. **Multiple File Formats**: Image files can be included with different extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf), and sometimes the extension might not be specified in the LaTeX command if the TeX engine is expected to automatically find the file.\n\n3. **Comments and Line Breaks**: File names could be split across lines or commented out. Comments in LaTeX start with `%` and anything following it on the same line is ignored by LaTeX. File names in the `\\includegraphics` command could also be broken across lines with the `%` character preventing line breaks from appearing in the output.\n\n4. **Optional Arguments**: The star (*) in the search pattern suggests there could be optional arguments within brackets before the file name. These arguments need to be correctly handled or ignored to extract just the file name.\n\n5. **File Paths**: File names might include relative or absolute paths, which must be handled differently than simple file names. It also means that directory separators (`/` or `\\`) could be present in the TARGET part.\n\n6. **Multiple Inclusions**: The same file might be included multiple times, which may or may not be relevant depending on whether we need to list each occurrence or unique file names.\n\n7. **Command Definitions and Custom Macros**: The `\\includegraphics` command could be wrapped inside a custom macro or new command defined elsewhere in the document, which complicates direct pattern matching.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, it will be necessary to parse the LaTeX file while accounting for optional arguments, ignoring comments, handling line breaks properly, and extracting the correct file paths and names even when they include directories or are broken across lines."
