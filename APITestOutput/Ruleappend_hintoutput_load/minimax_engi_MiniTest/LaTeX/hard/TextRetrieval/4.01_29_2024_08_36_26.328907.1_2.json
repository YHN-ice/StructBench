We need to account for these variations.\n\n2. **File path complexity**: The filenames may include relative or absolute paths, and these paths could have different directory separators (e.g., `/` or `\\`) or even complex structures with parent directory references (`..`).\n\n3. **Different file extensions**: Image files can come with various extensions such as `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.pdf`, `.eps`, etc. We need to ensure that we capture the full filename regardless of the extension used.\n\n4. **Comments and line breaks**: Parts of the LaTeX source might be commented out using the `%` symbol. If `\\includegraphics` appears in a comment, it shouldn't be counted. Also, the command and its arguments can be split across multiple lines, which can complicate the extraction.\n\n5. **Custom commands**: LaTeX allows users to create custom commands that could wrap around the `\\includegraphics` command, hiding it from a simple text search.\n\n6. **Environment conflicts**: If the `\\includegraphics` command is nested within certain LaTeX environments or conditional commands, it might behave differently or not be intended for processing in the same way.\n\nTo successfully extract all included figure filenames, a parsing approach must be robust enough to handle these complexities and variations."
