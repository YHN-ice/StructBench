Nested Commands: Bold text commands (`\\textbf{}`) might be nested within other LaTeX commands or environments, which can complicate extraction. For example, `\\textbf{\\emph{bold and italic}}` presents both bold and italic formatting nested together.\n\n2. Braces Within Text: The bold text itself might contain braces, potentially as part of another command or to denote a scope within the bold text. For example, `\\textbf{bold text with a command \\command{argument}}` includes braces within the bold text.\n\n3. Split Commands: The `\\textbf` command might be split across lines, or its argument might be on a different line than the command itself, making straightforward text extraction more difficult.\n\n4. Escaped Braces: Braces in LaTeX can be escaped to prevent them from being treated as command arguments. For example, `\\textbf{bold text with \\{braces\\}}` includes literal braces that should not be confused with the closing brace of the command.\n\n5. Custom Macros: The document might define custom macros that internally use `\\textbf`, but do not directly appear as `\\textbf`. Extracting bold text from these macros would require understanding their definitions.\n\n6. Comments: LaTeX comments (anything after a `%` on a line) might include the string `\\textbf{`, which should not be treated as a command since it is commented out.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts in the presence of these potential difficulties, the parsing algorithm will need to understand the context of the `\\textbf` commands and handle nested structures, escaped characters, and other peculiarities of LaTeX syntax."
