Anything following a `%` on a line should be ignored, as it is not part of the document content.\n\n3. **Multiple Lines**: The `\\includegraphics` command and its arguments might span multiple lines, which makes regex matching harder because you need to handle line breaks.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in one Line**: There can be more than one figure included in a single line, which requires the parser to find each instance separately.\n\n5. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that include graphics, so just looking for `\\includegraphics` might not catch all figures.\n\n6. **Different File Paths**: Image filenames could include relative or absolute paths, or even no path, just a filename.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Sometimes, LaTeX files include the file extension of the images, and sometimes they omit it because LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type.\n\nTo overcome these potential obstacles, the parser should:\n\n- Use a regular expression that captures variations in the `\\includegraphics` syntax.\n- Ignore comments by either removing them before parsing or by constructing the regex to not match if a `%` is present before the `\\includegraphics` command.\n- Handle line continuations and normalize the text by removing newline characters if necessary.\n- Search for all matches of the pattern rather than stopping after finding the first one.\n- Be aware of custom commands or environments that might need to be preprocessed before searching for included graphics.\n- Normalize file paths and consider both with and without file extensions in the filename matching process."
