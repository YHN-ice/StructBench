For example:\n   ```\n   \\textbf{This is \\emph{bold} text}\n   ```\n   In this case, it's necessary to correctly handle the inner braces without prematurely ending the bold text extraction.\n\n2. Escaped braces: Braces that are part of the text and not meant as command delimiters could be escaped with a backslash, such as `\\{` or `\\}`, which should not be confused with the actual command delimiters.\n\n3. Multiple \\textbf commands on the same line or in the same paragraph: The parser should be able to recognize and extract bold texts from multiple \\textbf commands even when they are adjacent or do not start on a new line.\n\n4. Incomplete or malformed commands: There might be syntax errors or typos in the LaTeX file, such as missing curly braces or incorrectly spelled macros, which could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n5. Comments: LaTeX comments, which start with %, should be ignored by the parser. If a \\textbf command is commented out, it shouldn't be included in the extraction.\n\n6. Command definitions and renewals: Custom LaTeX commands or redefinitions may change the behavior of \\textbf, which could affect the extraction process if not handled correctly.\n\n7. Environment-specific behavior: Some LaTeX environments could have special rules about formatting that could impact how \\textbf is interpreted.\n\n8. Starred variants: Some commands have a starred variant (e.g., \\textbf*{...}), which might need special handling depending on whether they alter text formatting in a significant way.\n\nFor an accurate extraction, the parser needs to take these potential issues into account and handle them appropriately to avoid false positives or negatives in the output."
