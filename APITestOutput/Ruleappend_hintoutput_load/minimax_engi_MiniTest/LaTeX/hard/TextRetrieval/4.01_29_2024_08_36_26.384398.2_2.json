The parser must recognize filenames without extensions and consider multiple common graphic file extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .pdf, .eps, etc.).\n\n4. **Multiple includes in one line**: A line in a LaTeX file might contain multiple \\includegraphics commands, and the parser should be able to extract all of them.\n\n5. **Commented out lines**: If a line containing the \\includegraphics command is commented out with a %, it should not be considered as including an actual figure.\n\n6. **Curly braces within optional arguments**: The optional argument might contain curly braces for specifying multiple options, which could complicate the parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n7. **Line breaks within commands**: Sometimes commands might be broken across lines, with the TARGET or optional arguments starting on a new line.\n\n8. **Custom commands or macros**: The document could define custom commands or macros that wrap \\includegraphics, which would require the parser to understand these abstractions.\n\nEach of these potential issues requires careful handling to ensure that all and only actual included figure files are extracted accurately.
