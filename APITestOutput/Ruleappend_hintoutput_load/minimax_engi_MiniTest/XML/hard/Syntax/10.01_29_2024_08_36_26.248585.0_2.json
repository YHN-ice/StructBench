Non-escaped special characters: Characters like \"<\" and \"&\" must be escaped as \"&lt;\" and \"&amp;\" respectively if they are used as data within an element.\n\n3. Unquoted attribute values: Attribute values must always be enclosed in quotes (either single or double quotes).\n\n4. Nested errors: Incorrectly nested elements will lead to structural errors. Make sure that elements are properly nested within each other.\n\n5. Missing root element: An XML document should have one and only one root element that encloses all the other elements.\n\n6. Case sensitivity: XML tags are case-sensitive, so `<Tag>` and `<tag>` would be considered different elements.\n\n7. Duplicated attributes: An element must not have two attributes with the same name.\n\nThese are some of the common structural issues you should look for when validating the structure of an XML file.
