For example, `**bold *italic* bold**`. We need to ensure that we only extract the text that is strictly bold and handle nested emphasis correctly.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes, the asterisks might be escaped using a backslash to display literal asterisks rather than for emphasis. For example, `\\**not bold\\**`. We need to properly ignore escaped sequences.\n\n3. **Unmatched Pairs:** There might be instances where the pairs of asterisks are not properly matched or closed. For example, `**bold without closing**`. This could lead to confusion about where the bold region starts or ends.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks:** Text within inline code blocks (surrounded by backticks `) should not be considered for formatting. For example, `` `**not bold**` `` should not be considered as bold text.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts:** Bold text might span across multiple lines. We'll need to make sure that the extraction process handles multiline bold segments correctly.\n\n6. **Spurious Double Stars:** There might be double stars used in a context that's not meant to be bold text, like in mathematical expressions or as bullet points.\n\n7. **Variations in Markdown Parsers:** Different Markdown parsers may have slightly different rules for how they handle edge cases in Markdown parsing. It's important to know which rules apply for the parser we are considering.\n\n8. **Overlapping or Consecutive Bold Sections:** There can be overlapping or consecutive bold sections which might complicate the parsing, such as `****` or `**bold1******bold2**`.\n\nTo cope with these difficulties, the parser should ideally have a robust pattern matching mechanism, taking into account the context and proper pairing of markdown symbols while avoiding false positives from escaped characters or code blocks. Now you can provide the input file, and I will proceed with extracting the bold texts as per your instruction."
