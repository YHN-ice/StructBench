Depending on what's needed, the parser has to handle both cases correctly.\n\n3. **Special characters**: Filenames may include spaces, special characters, or escape sequences that need to be handled or unescaped.\n\n4. **Nested Markdown elements**: Markdown can include nested elements, such as an image inside a link. This can complicate the parsing as it has to be decided which part of the syntax to prioritize.\n\n5. **Diverse image file extensions**: Images can have various file extensions (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, etc.), and the parser must recognize all possible valid image formats.\n\n6. **Non-image links**: Not every link in a Markdown file will be an image link. The parser must distinguish between image links and other types of links.\n\n7. **Markdown link references**: Markdown also allows for link references, where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document. These could potentially confuse a simple search for image syntax.\n\n8. **Handling of escape characters**: Characters like `!` and `[` might be escaped in the Markdown, and the parser needs to handle these correctly.\n\n9. **Ignoring false positives**: Sometimes text might look like an image link but isn't one (for example, in code blocks or when quoted).\n\n10. **Efficiency**: If the Markdown file is very large, the parser should work efficiently to extract the information without excessive resource usage.\n\nThese are just a few potential hurdles that might need to be addressed when building a Markdown file parser to extract image filenames."
