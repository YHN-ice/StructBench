Ensuring that these nested formats are correctly identified and not confused with the ending of the bold section can be challenging.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: In Markdown, characters can be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting. For instance, `\\*\\*Not Bold\\*\\*` should not be detected as bold.\n\n3. **Literal Double Stars**: Double stars might appear in the text literally, for example, in a mathematical context or within code blocks. These should not be mistaken for bold delimiters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Delimiters**: If there is an odd number of double-star delimiters, there might be a starting delimiter without a corresponding ending delimiter.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, so the parser must be able to identify bold text across line breaks.\n\n6. **Overlapping or Consecutive Formatting**: Bold delimiters might be immediately followed by or nested with other bold delimiters, which can complicate the parsing logic.\n\n7. **Whitespace Handling**: Sometimes, whitespace characters may appear immediately after or before the double-star characters, and different Markdown renderers have different rules about whether this constitutes bold formatting.\n\nTo provide you with accurate results from the input file, the parser will need to handle these cases carefully. Please share the input file so I can extract the bold texts as requested."
