If images are embedded using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown, they would need to be identified differently.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax might be escaped with backslashes in the text, potentially confusing the parser.\n\n5. **Non-standard Extensions**: Markdown is not a rigidly defined standard, and different implementations might have slight variations in how they handle image embedding.\n\n6. **Inline Text**: There may be inline text that looks similar to the image syntax but isn't actually an image link.\n\n7. **Nested Parentheses**: The TARGET part of the image link may contain parentheses, which can complicate the extraction if regex is used because it needs to handle nested structures which regex is not ideally suited for.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There can be multiple images on a single line, and the parser would need to identify each one separately.\n\n9. **Linked Images**: Sometimes images are linked to other URLs, adding another layer of parentheses and brackets to parse through.\n\n10. **Non-image Links**: Other links that are not images could be present and need to be ignored by the parser, as we only want to extract image files.\n\nProperly handling these cases would require a robust parsing strategy that can deal with a variety of markdown patterns and edge cases."
