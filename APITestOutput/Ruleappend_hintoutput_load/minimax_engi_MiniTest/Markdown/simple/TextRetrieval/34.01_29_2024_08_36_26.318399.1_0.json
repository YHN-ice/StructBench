We need to ensure that only the bold text is extracted and not the surrounding formatting.\n\n2. Escaped Characters: Markdown allows for escaping special characters like the asterisk (*) with a backslash (\\). So we need to distinguish between actual bold syntax and escaped asterisks.\n\n3. Incomplete Pairs of Asterisks: Sometimes, the writer may forget to close the bold formatting with a pair of asterisks. This could lead to incorrectly parsing until the end of the document or until another pair of asterisks is found.\n\n4. Inline Code Blocks: Text within inline code blocks (surrounded by backticks) should not be parsed as bold, even if it contains double asterisks.\n\n5. Multi-line Bold Text: Bold text in markdown can span multiple lines. Handling line breaks within bold text can be tricky because it's not always clear whether the line break should end bold formatting or not.\n\n6. Overlapping Formatting: There might be overlapping formatting, such as bold within italic or vice versa. Careful parsing is required to handle such cases.\n\n7. Different Markdown Flavors: There are different flavors of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.) with slight variations in syntax rules. We have to know which flavor we're parsing to handle it correctly.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to carefully parse the text to handle these cases and correctly extract only the bold text."
