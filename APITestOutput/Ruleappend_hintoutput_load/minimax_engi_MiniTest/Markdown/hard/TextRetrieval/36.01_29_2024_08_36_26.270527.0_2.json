We need to account for these variations.\n\n2. **Complex file paths**: The TARGET part might include complex file paths with directories, special characters, or spaces that need to be properly identified.\n\n3. **Embedded links**: Sometimes, images can be linked, which means there's a URL wrapped around the image syntax. We have to ensure we only extract the image file, not the link.\n\n4. **False positives**: There could be other parts of the markdown that look similar to the image syntax but aren't, such as links or embedded videos which might use similar brackets and parentheses.\n\n5. **Escape characters**: The markdown might contain escape characters that could affect the pattern matching.\n\n6. **Multiple images on one line**: There could be multiple images within a single line, so the parser must be able to handle and identify each one separately.\n\n7. **Inline HTML**: If the markdown contains inline HTML with image tags, it might be confusing for a markdown-based parser that is only looking for markdown syntax.\n\n8. **File name collisions**: If there are multiple images with the same name in different directories, it's important to capture the entire path to distinguish between them.\n\n9. **Alternate text variations**: The alternate text (the part within the square brackets) could contain nested brackets, which can complicate regex pattern matching.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we will need to create a robust pattern that can identify the image syntax accurately while accounting for these potential variances and complexities."
