We should ensure that the parser can handle slight variations if they are commonly accepted.\n\n2. **Escaped characters**: There might be escaped characters that could be mistaken as part of the syntax. For example, a backslash before an exclamation mark or brackets might make it look like an image when it's not.\n\n3. **Nested structures**: Images could be nested within other Markdown structures, such as links, lists, or blockquotes. The parser should be able to identify images regardless of their surrounding context.\n\n4. **Alternative text**: The alternative text of the image (inside the square brackets) could contain characters that mimic the syntax of an image file (e.g., `![Example](image.png \"Title\")` where \"Example\" includes parentheses or brackets).\n\n5. **Multiple images on a single line**: There might be multiple images on one line, which means the parser should be capable of identifying and extracting each individual image filename.\n\n6. **Links vs. Images**: Distinguishing between links and images could be tricky since they have similar syntax. An image starts with an exclamation mark (`!`), unlike a link, which is something the parser needs to account for.\n\n7. **Different quote styles for title attribute**: The title attribute might use single quotes, double quotes, or no quotes at all, which should be considered when parsing.\n\n8. **Variations in target path**: The `TARGET` might be a simple filename, a relative path, or an absolute URL. The parser should extract only the filename or the path correctly in each case.\n\n9. **File extensions**: We need to consider different image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) when parsing for filenames.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be designed with a robust pattern matching algorithm that can accurately identify and extract image syntax while considering the above points."
