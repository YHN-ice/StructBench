You need to ensure that you're only extracting the text content and not altering other markdown formatting.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks might be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to prevent them from being parsed as formatting. You need to differentiate between actual bold syntax and escaped characters.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Markdown allows for some variations in formatting (such as using `__` instead of `**` for bold text). You must decide whether to search only for the double asterisks or include other valid Markdown bold syntax.\n\n4. **Overlapping or Unmatched Markers**: There might be cases where the bold markers are unmatched or overlapping with other markers (like `**bold *italic bold***`). You'll need a strategy to handle such cases correctly.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines.
