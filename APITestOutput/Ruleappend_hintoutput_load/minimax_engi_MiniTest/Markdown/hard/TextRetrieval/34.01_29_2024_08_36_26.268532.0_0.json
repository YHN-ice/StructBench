If double stars are escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), they should not be treated as bold markers.\n\n3. **Mismatched Pairs:** There might be cases where the double stars are not properly paired, with an odd number of occurrences leading to ambiguity in what text is meant to be bold.\n\n4. **Inline Double Stars:** Sometimes, double stars might be used in a context that is not related to bold formatting, for example, in a mathematical expression or as part of a URL. These false positives need to be filtered out.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts:** Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines. Ensuring that the extraction process captures multiline bold text without prematurely ending at a line break can be challenging.\n\n6. **Overlapping Bold Ranges:** Overlapping or consecutive bold ranges could lead to confusion during the extraction process.\n\n7. **Incorrect Formatting Syntax:** Users might make mistakes in the Markdown syntax, such as leaving spaces between the double stars and the text (`** not bold **`), which could lead to improper parsing if not handled correctly.\n\nEach of these scenarios requires careful consideration in the parsing logic to ensure accurate extraction of bold text."
