Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, code blocks, or links. The parser must correctly identify the bold markers even within these contexts.\n\n2. Escaped characters: Double asterisks used for other purposes than bold text (e.g., in a code snippet) might be escaped with backslashes. The parser should differentiate between actual bold markers and escaped ones.\n\n3. Incomplete markers: If the Markdown file contains an odd number of double asterisks, there might be a marker that doesn't have a closing pair. The parser needs to handle this gracefully, either by ignoring it or by treating the last instance as regular text.\n\n4. Overlapping markers: Occasionally, Markdown might have overlapping markers that can confuse the parser, such as `**bold*italic***`. The parser needs to determine the correct boundaries for each formatting type.\n\n5. Line breaks: Bold text might span multiple lines. The parser must be able to handle line breaks within bold sections without terminating the bold formatting prematurely.\n\n6. Markdown variations: Different Markdown processors can have slight variations in how they handle bold text (such as using underscores in addition to asterisks). The parser should be prepared for these variations.\n\n7. Multiline paragraphs: In Markdown, paragraphs can span multiple lines without breaks if they are part of the same block. The parser must be able to treat these continuous lines as part of the same paragraph while searching for bold markers.\n\n8. Performance: For very large Markdown files, parsing performance could become an issue, especially if the parser needs to handle complex nested structures or perform multiple passes through the text.\n\nBy anticipating these challenges, we can more effectively parse the Markdown file and extract all bold texts accurately."
