Missing colons or using them without a key can cause errors.\n\n3. **Improper Scalars**: If a scalar (e.g., a string) contains special characters, it should be enclosed in quotes. If not, it might be interpreted incorrectly.\n\n4. **Sequences and Mappings**: Using incorrect characters for sequences (lists) and mappings (dictionaries) like forgetting dashes for list items or misusing curly braces can lead to errors.\n\n5. **Duplicated Keys**: Having the same key more than once in a mapping is generally not allowed and can result in undefined behavior.\n\n6. **Tab Characters**: Tabs are not allowed for indentation in YAML; spaces must be used instead.\n\n7. **Flow Style vs Block Style**: Mixing up flow style (inline style) with block style without proper syntax may cause parsing issues.\n\n8. **Multi-Line Strings**: Handling multi-line strings with `|` or `>` can be tricky, and if not done correctly, may result in errors.\n\n9. **Anchors and Aliases**: YAML allows for the definition of anchors and reuse with aliases; if an alias is used without a corresponding anchor, it will result in an error.\n\n10. **Document Start and End Markers**: While optional, if used incorrectly (`---` for start and `...` for end), they could introduce parsing issues.\n\nGiven these potential hurdles, let's now check the YAML input for any structural errors that may be present.
