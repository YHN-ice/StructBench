Missing colons or extra colons where they shouldn't be can cause errors.\n\n3. **Improper Scalars**: Scalars (basic, single-value data items) that contain special characters may need to be enclosed in quotes. If not properly quoted, this could lead to parsing errors.\n\n4. **Bad Mapping**: A key-value pair should have a key followed by a colon and a space before the value. Any deviation from this format can result in an error.\n\n5. **Duplicated Keys**: If a key is duplicated within the same map (level of indentation), this can cause unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n6. **Sequences and Mappings**: Using a dash (-) indicates an item in a sequence (list).
