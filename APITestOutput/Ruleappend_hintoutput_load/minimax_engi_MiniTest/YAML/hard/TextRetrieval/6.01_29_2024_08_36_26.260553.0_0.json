If the object with the specified `id` is referenced via an alias, the parser must correctly resolve it.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Key Names**: The parser must know what key to look for that denotes an `id`.

It needs to know whether to return the first match, all matches, or report an error if duplicates are not allowed.\n\n7. **Syntactical Errors**: If the YAML file contains syntactical errors, this could prevent accurate parsing and searching entirely.\n\n8. **Multiple Documents**: YAML supports multiple documents within a single file, separated by `---`.
