Maintaining the correct path during recursion is essential.\n\n4. **Similar keys in different levels:** It's possible to have the same key at different levels of the YAML hierarchy, which might be confusing when trying to record the correct path.\n\n5. **Ambiguity with '- ' and ':' indicators:** In YAML, '- ' indicates an array element, while ':' separates dictionary keys from values. Ensuring proper interpretation of these indicators is crucial for correct parsing.\n\n6. **Field names that are non-scalar values:** YAML allows complex keys, which can be non-scalar values like lists or other nested structures.\n\n7. **Special characters in keys:** Handling keys with special characters or reserved words in YAML could present parsing challenges.\n\n8. **Aliasing and Anchors:** YAML supports aliases and anchors that can create references to other parts of the document.
