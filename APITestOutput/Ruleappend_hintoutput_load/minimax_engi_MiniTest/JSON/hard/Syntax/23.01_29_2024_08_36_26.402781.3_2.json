Incorrect quotes: JSON requires double quotes for keys and string values, not single quotes.\n\n3. Missing or extra curly braces (`{}`) or square brackets (`[]`): These are used to define objects and arrays, respectively. A missing or extra brace or bracket can result in an invalid structure.\n\n4. Incorrect data types: JSON supports specific data types such as strings (in double quotes), numbers, objects, arrays, booleans (true/false), and null. Using an unsupported data type will cause an error.\n\n5. Trailing commas: While some parsers allow trailing commas, they are not permitted in the JSON standard.\n\n6. Nested structures: Errors might be harder to spot in nested objects or arrays if indentation is not clear.\n\n7. Encoding issues: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8 without BOM; encoding errors can cause parsing to fail.\n\n8. Comments: Standard JSON does not support comments. Including them will cause a parsing error.\n\nPlease provide the JSON input for analysis."
