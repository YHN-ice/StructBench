Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Nested Structures**: JSON files can contain deeply nested structures, which require recursive or iterative approaches to traverse effectively. Keeping track of the current path within these nested structures can be complex.\n\n2. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be challenging to process the entire structure in memory, and streaming parsers or chunk processing techniques may be necessary.\n\n3. **Similar Keys**: JSON objects can have keys with the same name at different levels of nesting. Distinguishing between these and tracking the correct path to the desired value can be tricky.\n\n4. **Arrays**: JSON arrays add complexity because they introduce an index-based path component, rather than a key-based one. Handling both types of paths (key-based for objects and index-based for arrays) is necessary.\n\n5. **Dynamic Content**: JSON structures can be very dynamic, with different types or structures of content under each key. Path-finding algorithms must be able to handle this variability.\n\n6. **Field Exclusion**: The requirement to exclude the \"subs\" field from the search and only record the path upon finding the target value means that a simple key-value search is not adequate. A more sophisticated approach is needed to selectively traverse fields.\n\n7. **Performance**: Efficiently searching through the JSON structure without unnecessary processing is important, especially for large files. This may require optimization of the search algorithm.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: Handling malformed JSON or unexpected data types at various points in the structure (e.g., an array where an object is expected) must be considered to avoid runtime errors.\n\n9. **Data Types**: JSON supports different data types like numbers, strings, booleans, null, arrays, and objects. Ensuring that comparisons are type-safe is important to prevent false matches.\n\n10. **Path Recording**: The requirement to record the path in a specific format (`obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...`) means that careful string building or stack manipulation is necessary to accurately represent the traversal path.\n\nDepending on the structure of the provided JSON file and the specific value (\"wy\") being searched for, one or more of these difficulties may need to be addressed in order to successfully parse the file and provide the correct path to access the value."
