This could lead to ambiguity in determining which object to retrieve.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports different data types (such as arrays, objects, strings, numbers, etc.). It's important to ensure that when traversing the JSON structure, each element is handled according to its type.\n\n5. **Missing or Incorrect IDs**: If the object with the specified ID does not exist or there's a typo in the ID, it could lead to an unsuccessful search.\n\n6. **Circular References**: In some cases, JSON structures might have circular references (though typically not recommended). Detecting and handling these requires additional logic to avoid infinite loops during recursion.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: There might be errors in the JSON structure or in the file itself (like incomplete JSON, syntax errors), which would need to be handled gracefully.\n\n8. **Encoding and Decoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is encoded in a different format than expected, decoding issues might arise.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust JSON parsing algorithm must be implemented, capable of recursive traversal, error handling, and efficient processing techniques like streaming for large files, if necessary."
