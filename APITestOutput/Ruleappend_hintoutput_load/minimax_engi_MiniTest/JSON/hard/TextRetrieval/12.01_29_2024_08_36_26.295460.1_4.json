Deeply Nested Structures: Deeply nested structures can be hard to navigate, especially if the nesting is irregular or the structure of the JSON is complex.\n\n3. Recursive Parsing: To find the most deeply nested objects, a recursive algorithm may be required. Recursion can be tricky to implement correctly, especially if there is a risk of exceeding the maximum recursion depth in the execution environment.\n\n4.
