A common error is forgetting to include these separators between key-value pairs in an object or between values in an array.\n\n2. **Improper Quotation Marks**: In JSON, keys and string values should be enclosed in double quotes (\"). Missing or incorrect use of quotation marks can cause parsing errors.\n\n3. **Mismatched Braces and Brackets**: Every opening brace `{` should have a corresponding closing brace `}`, and every opening bracket `[` should have a corresponding closing bracket `]`. Unbalanced or missing braces/brackets can lead to structural errors.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: Although some parsers allow trailing commas, they are not allowed in the JSON standard. A trailing comma after the last item in an object or array is an error.\n\n5. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Errors can occur if the values are not of the expected type.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains characters that are not properly encoded, it may not parse correctly.\n\n7. **Nested Structures Complexity**: Highly nested JSON structures can make it difficult to spot missing or extra braces or brackets.\n\n8. **Extraneous Characters**: Any characters outside of the JSON structure, such as additional text before or after the JSON content, can cause errors.\n\nDetecting these issues typically involves parsing the JSON file with a parser that adheres strictly to the JSON specification, and then reporting any syntax errors encountered during the process."
