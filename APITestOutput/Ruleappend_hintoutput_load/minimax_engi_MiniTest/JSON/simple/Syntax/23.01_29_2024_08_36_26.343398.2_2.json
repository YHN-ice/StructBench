Single quotes or unquoted keys can cause errors.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Incorrect data types or formats, such as using a string to represent a boolean value, could cause parsing issues.\n\n5. **Colon Usage**: Forgetting to place a colon `:` between a key and its value can lead to an error.\n\n6. **Nested Objects & Arrays**: Complex JSON with nested objects and arrays may make it more difficult to spot errors manually.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains characters that are not properly encoded, it could cause parsing errors.\n\n8. **File Size**: Large JSON files can be cumbersome to parse and check manually.\n\nTo ensure accurate results, the parser must be capable of systematically checking for these issues and reporting any syntax errors encountered.
