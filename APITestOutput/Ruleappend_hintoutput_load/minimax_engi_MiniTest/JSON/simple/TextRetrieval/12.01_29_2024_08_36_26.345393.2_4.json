However, there are some common challenges that may be encountered when looking for the most deeply nested objects in JSON:\n\n1. Recursive Structure: JSON files can have deeply nested structures, making it crucial to implement a robust recursive function that can traverse through all the levels.\n\n2. Handling Empty `subs`: To find the most deeply nested objects, it's necessary to identify objects whose `subs` field is empty. Accurately checking for emptiness (such as differentiating between an empty list, `[]`, and an empty dictionary, `{}`) is key.\n\n3. Tracking the Depth: Keeping track of the depth of the current object in relation to the entire structure might be required if we need to compare depths of various objects.\n\n4. Large File Size: If the JSON file is particularly large, there could be performance issues due to the size and complexity of the data.\n\n5. Variety of Data Types: JSON supports various data types, such as strings, numbers, objects (dicts), arrays (lists), booleans, and null. Ensuring that the parser can handle all these types correctly when traversing the structure is important.\n\n6. Consistent Data Format: Assuming a consistent format where each object has a `subs` field is important. If some objects don't follow this structure, additional checks will be needed.\n\n7. Output Formatting: The requirement to provide excerpts of the most deeply nested objects as they appear in the JSON file suggests that we need to preserve formatting, which can be a challenge in itself if the JSON is minified or not well-formatted.\n\nThese are some general challenges one might face when working with JSON parsing to find deeply nested objects. Once we have the JSON input, we can apply a recursive search strategy while keeping these potential difficulties in mind."
