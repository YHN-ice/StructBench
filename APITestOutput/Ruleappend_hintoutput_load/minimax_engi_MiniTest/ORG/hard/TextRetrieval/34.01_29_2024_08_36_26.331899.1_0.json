Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when performing this task:\n\n1. Nested formatting: If the ORG file contains nested formatting, such as bold text within italicized or underlined sections, it may be challenging to correctly identify the start and end of the bold text without inadvertently including surrounding formatting.\n\n2. Overlapping markers: If there are multiple consecutive formatting markers without text in between (e.g., \"*_bold and italic_*\"), it might be difficult to determine which markers are meant to denote bold text.\n\n3. Escaped characters: Sometimes, asterisks might be escaped (e.g., \\*) and not meant to denote formatting. This would require logic to ignore such escaped characters when searching for bold markers.\n\n4. Inconsistent formatting: There may be inconsistencies in how text is marked as bold, such as missing closing asterisks for bold sections or accidental insertion of asterisks that are not meant for text formatting.\n\n5. Line breaks and whitespace: Bold text could span multiple lines or include significant whitespace, which needs to be accounted for to ensure accurate extraction of the text.\n\n6. Large files and performance: If the ORG file is very large, there may be performance considerations to efficiently parse and extract bold texts without consuming excessive resources.\n\n7. Ambiguous markers: If the file uses asterisks for other purposes besides bold formatting (for example, bullet points in lists), it may require additional logic to distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\nAddressing these challenges would involve creating a robust parsing algorithm that can accurately identify and handle various formatting scenarios while extracting the required bold text."
