It's important to ensure that only the bold text is extracted, without accidentally including the formatting markers for other styles.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes an asterisk may be escaped to show the literal `*` character rather than indicating bold text. We'll need to distinguish between actual formatting markers and escaped characters.\n\n3. **Broken Formatting**: There might be instances where the formatting is not correctly applied, with missing or extra asterisks, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: Bold text might span multiple lines, so the logic needs to account for content that is not confined to a single line.\n\n5. **Asterisks Used for Other Purposes**: In ORG files, asterisks are also used for outlining hierarchy (e.g., headers) or for lists. We need to ensure we only interpret asterisks as bold markers when they are meant to indicate bold text and not structural elements.\n\n6. **Overlapping Formats**: In some cases, bold formatting might overlap with other sections or elements. Care must be taken to accurately extract the intended content without including surrounding texts.\n\n7. **Consistency in Markers**: The use of single asterisks `*` to denote bold text might not be consistent throughout the document. We have to ensure that we follow the pattern correctly across the entire document.\n\n8. **Text Variability**: The content within bold text can vary greatly, including the presence of special characters, numbers, or various symbols, which should all be handled correctly.\n\nTo accurately extract bold text given these potential obstacles, we will likely need a robust parsing algorithm, potentially incorporating regular expressions or a state machine to keep track of the starts and ends of bold sections while navigating through the text."
