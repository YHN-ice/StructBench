It is important to differentiate between image file links and others, which might require checking the file extension or additional context.\n\n4. **Special Characters or Whitespace:** File names could contain special characters or whitespace that complicate the parsing process. Escaping these characters or handling whitespace properly would be essential.\n\n5. **File Path vs. File Name:** Some links might include a full path to the image file rather than just the file name. In such cases, the process must extract just the file name part of the path.\n\n6. **Duplicate File Names:** The ORG file might contain references to the same image file multiple times. The parser should account for duplicates if the goal is to list unique image file names.\n\n7. **Incorrect or Broken Links:** There may be incorrectly formatted links or typos in the ORG file that could lead to misidentifying a link as an image file.\n\nOnce we have access to the ORG file content, we can address these challenges by implementing a robust parsing mechanism that can handle these variances and accurately extract the names of image files."
