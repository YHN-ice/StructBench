Nested formatting should be preserved as is within the bold text.\n\n2. **Escaped markers**: The parser must be able to distinguish between actual formatting markers and escaped markers (e.g., \\*text\\*) where the asterisks are not meant to represent bold formatting but are part of the content.\n\n3. **Unbalanced markers**: There may be instances where the markers are unbalanced, with more opening or closing asterisks than expected.
