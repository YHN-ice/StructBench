We need to ensure that the parser correctly identifies only the outermost single asterisks as the bold delimiters.\n\n2. Escaped asterisks: In some texts, asterisks might be escaped to display them as literal characters rather than formatting markers (e.g., `\\*text\\*`). The parser must differentiate between escaped and unescaped asterisks.\n\n3. Overlapping formatting ranges: If there is overlapping or improperly nested formatting (e.g., *bold _italic and bold* still italic_), it could lead to incorrect extractions. The parser should handle these cases gracefully.\n\n4. Single asterisks used for list items: In ORG files, a single asterisk at the beginning of a line might be used to denote a headline or a list item rather than bold text. The parser must distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n5. Multiline bold texts: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to preserve the integrity of the text while extracting it.\n\n6. Unpaired asterisks: There may be instances where an asterisk is not paired with another, which could throw off the count and pairing of bold delimiters.\n\nNow that we've identified potential difficulties, please provide the ORG file content so that I can proceed with extracting the bold texts for you."
