Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. It's important to ensure that the extraction process doesn't get confused by these other elements.\n\n2. Escaped asterisks: In some cases, asterisks might be escaped to display them as literal characters rather than formatting indicators. The parser must differentiate between actual formatting asterisks and escaped asterisks.\n\n3. Unbalanced asterisks: There might be instances where an asterisk is used but not closed properly, resulting in unbalanced pairs. The parser must decide how to handle these cases—whether to ignore them, assume a closing asterisk at the end of the line, or flag them as errors.\n\n4. Line breaks and whitespace: Bold text may span across multiple lines or contain leading/trailing whitespace that should be trimmed or preserved based on the context and requirements.\n\n5. Overlapping or adjacent formatting: Bold text might be immediately followed by or preceded by another formatting element. Care must be taken to ensure that the parser correctly identifies the start and end of the bold segments.\n\n6. Special characters: Depending on the encoding of the ORG file, there might be special characters that affect how the text is parsed. These need to be handled correctly to avoid corrupting the extracted text.\n\n7. Large files: If the ORG file is very large, there could be performance considerations to take into account, ensuring that the parser works efficiently and does not consume excessive memory or CPU time.\n\nAppropriate handling of these challenges is essential for accurate extraction of bold texts from an ORG file."
