The parser must accurately identify and extract only the TARGET part.\n\n3. **Multiple Instances**: A single line may contain multiple instances of `[[TARGET]]`, and the parser should extract all occurrences.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). The parser should not assume any specific extension unless specified.\n\n5. **Non-Image Files**: The pattern `[[TARGET]]` might be used for files that are not images. If the task is to extract only image files, the parser might need additional logic to filter out non-image file names.\n\n6. **Special Characters**: File names may contain special characters that need to be handled correctly, such as spaces or characters that are reserved in URLs.\n\n7. **Linked Descriptions**: ORG mode allows linking with descriptions in the format `[[TARGET][DESCRIPTION]]`, the parser should not mistake the description for part of the file name.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: In some formats, characters within the pattern may be escaped (e.g., `[[My\\ Image.png]]` for a file named \"My Image.png\"). The parser needs to unescape these characters.\n\n9. **Nested Links**: Though less common, links can sometimes be nested within each other, which might complicate parsing.\n\n10. **Comments and Directives**: The ORG file may contain comments or directives that should not be parsed as content.\n\n11. **Incomplete or Broken Links**: There may be instances where the link format is started but not completed correctly (e.g., missing closing brackets), which could trip up the parser.\n\n12. **Performance**: If the ORG file is large, performance considerations may be necessary to ensure efficient parsing.\n\nLet's proceed with parsing the input ORG file while keeping these potential obstacles in mind."
