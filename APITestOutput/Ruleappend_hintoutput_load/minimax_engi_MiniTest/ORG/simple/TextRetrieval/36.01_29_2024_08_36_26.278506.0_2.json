Depending on the requirements, duplicate filenames may need to be listed once or each time they appear.\n\n8. **Inline Text**: Image links could be placed inline with text, so the parser needs to correctly identify the links without being thrown off by surrounding text.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be carefully designed to recognize and extract the correct information according to the specified pattern and rules of the ORG file format."
