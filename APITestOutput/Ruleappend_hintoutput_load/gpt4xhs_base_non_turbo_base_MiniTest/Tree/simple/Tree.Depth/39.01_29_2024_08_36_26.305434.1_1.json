        "Question: What is the depth of node qc? Answer an integer, root is of depth 0.\nTo find the depth of a node, you need to find the number of edges from root to node. You have to start from the root with depth 0 and assign the depth for each node recursively. For any given node, it gets depth of current depth. Increment the depth by 1 before go to its subtree and repeat the process until every node gets a depth.\n\nInput: \nv->w\nw->x\nx->y\nx->z\nx->ab\nx->bb\nw->cb\ncb->db\ncb->eb\ncb->fb\ncb->gb\nw->hb\nhb->ib\nhb->jb\nhb->kb\nhb->lb\nw->mb\nmb->nb\nmb->ob\nmb->pb\nmb->qb\nv->rb\nrb->sb\nsb->tb\nsb->ub\nsb->vb\nsb->wb\nrb->xb\nxb->yb\nxb->zb\nxb->ac\nxb->bc\nrb->cc\ncc->dc\ncc->ec\ncc->fc\ncc->gc\nrb->hc\nhc->ic\nhc->jc\nhc->kc\nhc->lc\nv->mc\nmc->nc\nnc->oc\nnc->pc\nnc->qc\nnc->rc\nmc->sc\nsc->tc\nsc->uc\nsc->vc\nsc->wc\nmc->xc\nxc->yc\nxc->zc\nxc->ad\nxc->bd\nmc->cd\ncd->dd\ncd->ed\ncd->fd\ncd->gd\nv->hd\nhd->id\nid->jd\nid->kd\nid->ld\nid->md\nhd->nd\nnd->od\nnd->pd\nnd->qd\nnd->rd\nhd->sd\nsd->td\nsd->ud\nsd->vd\nsd->wd\nhd->xd\nxd->yd\nxd->zd\nxd->ae\nxd->be\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
