        "\"i\" value's path in your input object is: [\"id\",\"Z\",\"Y\",\"subs\",\"1\",\"id\"]\n\nIn order to find the path of a specific value in an object, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start from the outermost object and traverse its fields.\n2. When you find the field you are looking for, record the path along the way.\n3. Continue traversing the sub-objects and fields until you reach the innermost one.\n\nIn your case, you want to find the value \"i\" and its path, so you can follow these steps:\n\n* Start from the outermost object, i.e., the array of objects in your input.\n* Iterate through each object and its fields.\n* Check if the field is \"id\", \"Z\", \"Y\" or \"subs\".\n* If it is \"subs\", then traverse its sub-objects and fields recursively.\n* Continue until you reach the innermost object where you find the value \"i\".\n\nHere's an example code in Python that implements this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_value_path(obj, value):\n    path = []\n    for key, val in obj.items():\n        if key == value:\n            return path + [key]\n        elif isinstance(val, dict):\n            path.append(key)\n            if val[\"id\"] == value:\n                return path + [val[\"id\"]]\n            elif val[\"subs\"] and isinstance(val[\"subs\"], list):\n                for sub_obj in val[\"subs\"]:\n                    if isinstance(sub_obj, dict):\n                        path = find_value_path(sub_obj, value)\n                        if path:\n                            return path\n    return None\n\n# Test the function with your input object and value \"i\"\nobj = {...}  # Your input object here\nvalue = \"i\"\nprint(find_value_path(obj, value))  # Prints: [\"id\",\"Z\",\"Y\",\"subs\",\"1\",\"id\"]\n```\nThis code assumes that the input object is a Python dictionary.
