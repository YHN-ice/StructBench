        "Question: How many people who work in CA are taller than 180?\nTo get the number of people living in specified city who are also taller than threshold, you need to first join the two table on primeKey, and check each row of joined table for lines that satisfies both condition, i.e., lines with city specified in query and height strictly greater than threshold. The total number of such rows is the right answer.\n\nInput: \nprimeKey\tgender\tage\tname\theight\tweight\tcolor\na\tfemale\t46\tr\t184\t120\twhite\nb\tmale\t52\ts\t124\t168\tbrown\nc\tmale\t32\tt\t203\t136\tolive\nd\tmale\t70\tu\t138\t168\tolive\ne\tmale\t70\tv\t169\t159\tswarthy\nf\tfemale\t48\tw\t219\t72\tolive\ng\tfemale\t52\tx\t148\t83\tswarthy\n\nprimeKey\tstatus\tsalary\tcompany\tlocation\na\tunemployed\t90818\tMicrosoft\tCA\nb\tretired\t312289\tMeta\tIL\nc\tretired\t126875\tTwitter\tTX\nd\temployed\t516418\tMicrosoft\tIL\ne\temployed\t981032\tMeta\tCA\nf\tretired\t643057\tTwitter\tTX\ng\tunemployed\t763295\tTwitter\tNY\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "To answer this question, you need to join the two tables based on the primary key (primeKey) and then check for rows where the height is greater than 180.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Start by selecting all rows from table 1 (people) where the primeKey matches a row in table 2 (employees).\n\nSQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT table1.*\nFROM table1\nJOIN table2 ON table1.primeKey = table2.primeKey\n```\n\n2. Then, you need to check for rows in the joined table where the gender is male and age is greater than or equal to 70 (the people who are still employed in their later years).\n\nSQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM (SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.primeKey = table2.primeKey) AS tempTable\nWHERE table1.gender = 'male' AND table1.age >= 70\n```\n\nNow, this query will give you the total number of people who work in CA and are taller than 180. You can also filter based on gender and age if you want to get a more specific answer.\n\nAnswer: 4 (a, e, g, and f) out of 6 people who work in CA are taller than 180."
