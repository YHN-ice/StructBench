Print those raw texts separated by \\n.\nTo find the bold texts, search for single star, i.e., *, the content between two occurances of single star is the bold texts. Note that the bold range should start from the single star occuring at i-th spot throughout the whole input file, where i is odd, and end with single star occuring at jth spot where j is even. For example, text between single star appearing first and second time.\n\nInput: \nv\nhalo essence lamb oops gr[[pe.jpeg]]oot halo qualify cafe\n* w\nidiot essence la[[qe.png]]mb oops groot halo qualify cafe\n** x\njargon essence lamb oops groo[[re.jpeg]]t halo qualify cafe\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
