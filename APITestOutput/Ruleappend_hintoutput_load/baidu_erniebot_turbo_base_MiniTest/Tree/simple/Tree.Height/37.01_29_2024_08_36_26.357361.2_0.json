        "Question: What is the height of the root node, i.e., the number of edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf nodes? Answer an integer, leaf is of height 0.\nTo answer the height of tree, you need to take a recursive strategy. For each node, you will find its height by first finding its children's heights. Then, the height of node is the maximum subtree heights plus 1. The base case occurs when a node has no children, i.e., its a leaf node. Leaf's height is defined to be 0, without the need of further queries. Then the height the tree is the height of its root node.\n\nInput: \nt->u\nu->v\nv->w\nv->x\nv->y\nv->z\nu->ab\nab->bb\nab->cb\nab->db\nab->eb\nu->fb\nfb->gb\nfb->hb\nfb->ib\nfb->jb\nu->kb\nkb->lb\nkb->mb\nkb->nb\nkb->ob\nt->pb\npb->qb\nqb->rb\nqb->sb\nqb->tb\nqb->ub\npb->vb\nvb->wb\nvb->xb\nvb->yb\nvb->zb\npb->ac\nac->bc\nac->cc\nac->dc\nac->ec\npb->fc\nfc->gc\nfc->hc\nfc->ic\nfc->jc\nt->kc\nkc->lc\nlc->mc\nlc->nc\nlc->oc\nlc->pc\nkc->qc\nqc->rc\nqc->sc\nqc->tc\nqc->uc\nkc->vc\nvc->wc\nvc->xc\nvc->yc\nvc->zc\nkc->ad\nad->bd\nad->cd\nad->dd\nad->ed\nt->fd\nfd->gd\ngd->hd\ngd->id\ngd->jd\ngd->kd\nfd->ld\nld->md\nld->nd\nld->od\nld->pd\nfd->qd\nqd->rd\nqd->sd\nqd->td\nqd->ud\nfd->vd\nvd->wd\nvd->xd\nvd->yd\nvd->zd\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "The height of the root node is 6, which means that the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node is 6. Here's the calculation:\n\n1. The height of the root node (t) is 1.\n2. The height of u is 2, because it has a child v and v has a child w.\n3. The height of v is 3, because it has a child x, y and z.\n4. The height of ab is 3, because it has children fb, fc and gc, but because fb has a child i it gets an extra height increment of 1.\n5. The height of fb is 3 because it has a child h, which in turn has a child j, which gives it an extra height increment of 1.\n\nSince all nodes are represented by integers, we can use this to calculate the maximum subtree height. If we sum up all the heights from the root to leaf nodes, we get a total of 27 (which is represented by integer numbers in the tree). Since this is greater than or equal to the total number of edges in the longest path (which is 6), we know that the height of the tree is at least 6.\n\nSo, the answer is 6."
