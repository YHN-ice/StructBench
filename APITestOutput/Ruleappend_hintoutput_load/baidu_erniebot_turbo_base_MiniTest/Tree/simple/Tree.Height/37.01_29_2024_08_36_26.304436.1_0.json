        "Question: What is the height of the root node, i.e., the number of edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf nodes? Answer an integer, leaf is of height 0.\nTo answer the height of tree, you need to take a recursive strategy. For each node, you will find its height by first finding its children's heights. Then, the height of node is the maximum subtree heights plus 1. The base case occurs when a node has no children, i.e., its a leaf node. Leaf's height is defined to be 0, without the need of further queries. Then the height the tree is the height of its root node.\n\nInput: \nv->w\nw->x\nx->y\nx->z\nx->ab\nx->bb\nw->cb\ncb->db\ncb->eb\ncb->fb\ncb->gb\nw->hb\nhb->ib\nhb->jb\nhb->kb\nhb->lb\nw->mb\nmb->nb\nmb->ob\nmb->pb\nmb->qb\nv->rb\nrb->sb\nsb->tb\nsb->ub\nsb->vb\nsb->wb\nrb->xb\nxb->yb\nxb->zb\nxb->ac\nxb->bc\nrb->cc\ncc->dc\ncc->ec\ncc->fc\ncc->gc\nrb->hc\nhc->ic\nhc->jc\nhc->kc\nhc->lc\nv->mc\nmc->nc\nnc->oc\nnc->pc\nnc->qc\nnc->rc\nmc->sc\nsc->tc\nsc->uc\nsc->vc\nsc->wc\nmc->xc\nxc->yc\nxc->zc\nxc->ad\nxc->bd\nmc->cd\ncd->dd\ncd->ed\ncd->fd\ncd->gd\nv->hd\nhd->id\nid->jd\nid->kd\nid->ld\nid->md\nhd->nd\nnd->od\nnd->pd\nnd->qd\nnd->rd\nhd->sd\nsd->td\nsd->ud\nsd->vd\nsd->wd\nhd->xd\nxd->yd\nxd->zd\nxd->ae\nxd->be\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "The height of the tree is 6. The longest path from the root node to any leaf node is represented by the following diagram:\n\n* Root -> xb -> zb -> ac -> ec -> fd -> gd -> hd\n* The path has a total of 6 edges.\n\nTo calculate the height of the tree, you need to follow the recursive strategy explained in the question. You start by finding the height of each node's children, and then take the maximum of all subtree heights plus 1.\n\nIn this case, the height of the root node is 1, and the height of each child node is 0 (except for xb, which has a height of 1). The height of xb is 1, and its children have heights of 0. The height of zb is also 1, and its children have heights of 0. The path from root to ec has a height of 2, and its children have heights of 0. The path from ec to fd has a height of 3, and its children have heights of 0. The path from fd to gd has a height of 4, and its children have heights of 1.
