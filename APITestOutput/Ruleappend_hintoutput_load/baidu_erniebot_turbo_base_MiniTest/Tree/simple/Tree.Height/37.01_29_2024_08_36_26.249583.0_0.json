        "Question: What is the height of the root node, i.e., the number of edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf nodes? Answer an integer, leaf is of height 0.\nTo answer the height of tree, you need to take a recursive strategy. For each node, you will find its height by first finding its children's heights. Then, the height of node is the maximum subtree heights plus 1. The base case occurs when a node has no children, i.e., its a leaf node. Leaf's height is defined to be 0, without the need of further queries. Then the height the tree is the height of its root node.\n\nInput: \ne->f\nf->g\ng->h\ng->i\ng->j\ng->k\nf->l\nl->m\nl->n\nl->o\nl->p\nf->q\nq->r\nq->s\nq->t\nq->u\nf->v\nv->w\nv->x\nv->y\nv->z\ne->ab\nab->bb\nbb->cb\nbb->db\nbb->eb\nbb->fb\nab->gb\ngb->hb\ngb->ib\ngb->jb\ngb->kb\nab->lb\nlb->mb\nlb->nb\nlb->ob\nlb->pb\nab->qb\nqb->rb\nqb->sb\nqb->tb\nqb->ub\ne->vb\nvb->wb\nwb->xb\nwb->yb\nwb->zb\nwb->ac\nvb->bc\nbc->cc\nbc->dc\nbc->ec\nbc->fc\nvb->gc\ngc->hc\ngc->ic\ngc->jc\ngc->kc\nvb->lc\nlc->mc\nlc->nc\nlc->oc\nlc->pc\ne->qc\nqc->rc\nrc->sc\nrc->tc\nrc->uc\nrc->vc\nqc->wc\nwc->xc\nwc->yc\nwc->zc\nwc->ad\nqc->bd\nbd->cd\nbd->dd\nbd->ed\nbd->fd\nqc->gd\ngd->hd\ngd->id\ngd->jd\ngd->kd\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "The height of the tree is 5.\n\nThe tree has 13 nodes, and the longest path from the root node to any leaf node is 5 nodes long. The height of a node is the length of the longest path from that node to any leaf node, so the height of the root node is also 5.\n\nHere's the recursive algorithm in pseudocode:\n\n\n```scss\nfunction tree_height(node):\n    if node is a leaf:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        max_height = 0\n        for each child of node:\n            new_height = tree_height(child)\n            max_height = max(max_height, new_height)\n        return max_height + 1\n```\nYou can start from the root node and follow the edges to get the longest path length. Here's how you would calculate the height of the tree:\n\n\n```scss\ntree_height(e) = 2\ntree_height(f) = 3\ntree_height(g) = 4\ntree_height(l) = 3 (note that l has multiple children with different depths)\ntree_height(q) = 3\n\ntotal = 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 1 (for root node)\n```\nTherefore, the height of the tree is 5."
