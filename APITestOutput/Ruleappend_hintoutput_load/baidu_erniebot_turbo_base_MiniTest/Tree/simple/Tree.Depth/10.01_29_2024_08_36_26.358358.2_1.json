        "Question: What is the depth of node mc? Answer an integer, root is of depth 0.\nTo find the depth of a node, you need to find the number of edges from root to node. You have to start from the root with depth 0 and assign the depth for each node recursively. For any given node, it gets depth of current depth. Increment the depth by 1 before go to its subtree and repeat the process until every node gets a depth.\n\nInput: \nt->u\nu->v\nv->w\nv->x\nv->y\nv->z\nu->ab\nab->bb\nab->cb\nab->db\nab->eb\nu->fb\nfb->gb\nfb->hb\nfb->ib\nfb->jb\nu->kb\nkb->lb\nkb->mb\nkb->nb\nkb->ob\nt->pb\npb->qb\nqb->rb\nqb->sb\nqb->tb\nqb->ub\npb->vb\nvb->wb\nvb->xb\nvb->yb\nvb->zb\npb->ac\nac->bc\nac->cc\nac->dc\nac->ec\npb->fc\nfc->gc\nfc->hc\nfc->ic\nfc->jc\nt->kc\nkc->lc\nlc->mc\nlc->nc\nlc->oc\nlc->pc\nkc->qc\nqc->rc\nqc->sc\nqc->tc\nqc->uc\nkc->vc\nvc->wc\nvc->xc\nvc->yc\nvc->zc\nkc->ad\nad->bd\nad->cd\nad->dd\nad->ed\nt->fd\nfd->gd\ngd->hd\ngd->id\ngd->jd\ngd->kd\nfd->ld\nld->md\nld->nd\nld->od\nld->pd\nfd->qd\nqd->rd\nqd->sd\nqd->td\nqd->ud\nfd->vd\nvd->wd\nvd->xd\nvd->yd\nvd->zd\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
