        "Question: What is the depth of node tb? Answer an integer, root is of depth 0.\nTo find the depth of a node, you need to find the number of edges from root to node. You have to start from the root with depth 0 and assign the depth for each node recursively. For any given node, it gets depth of current depth. Increment the depth by 1 before go to its subtree and repeat the process until every node gets a depth.\n\nInput: \ne->f\nf->g\ng->h\ng->i\ng->j\ng->k\nf->l\nl->m\nl->n\nl->o\nl->p\nf->q\nq->r\nq->s\nq->t\nq->u\nf->v\nv->w\nv->x\nv->y\nv->z\ne->ab\nab->bb\nbb->cb\nbb->db\nbb->eb\nbb->fb\nab->gb\ngb->hb\ngb->ib\ngb->jb\ngb->kb\nab->lb\nlb->mb\nlb->nb\nlb->ob\nlb->pb\nab->qb\nqb->rb\nqb->sb\nqb->tb\nqb->ub\ne->vb\nvb->wb\nwb->xb\nwb->yb\nwb->zb\nwb->ac\nvb->bc\nbc->cc\nbc->dc\nbc->ec\nbc->fc\nvb->gc\ngc->hc\ngc->ic\ngc->jc\ngc->kc\nvb->lc\nlc->mc\nlc->nc\nlc->oc\nlc->pc\ne->qc\nqc->rc\nrc->sc\nrc->tc\nrc->uc\nrc->vc\nqc->wc\nwc->xc\nwc->yc\nwc->zc\nwc->ad\nqc->bd\nbd->cd\nbd->dd\nbd->ed\nbd->fd\nqc->gd\ngd->hd\ngd->id\ngd->jd\ngd->kd\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
