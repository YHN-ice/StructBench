        "In the provided input, you have an object with nested fields. To access the value \"i\" from the specified path, you can follow the provided steps:\n\n1.

Inside the \"subs\" field, traverse its nested fields and values until you find the second occurrence of \"subs\".\n3. Inside the second occurrence of \"subs\", you will find the value \"i\".\n\nHere's an example code in Python that follows these steps:\n\n\n```python\ndef get_value(obj, path):\n    for key, value in obj.items():\n        if key == \"subs\":\n            if isinstance(value, dict):\n                new_path = path + \".\" + key + \"[id]\"\n                return get_value(value, new_path)\n            elif isinstance(value, list):\n                new_path = path + \"[0]\"\n                return get_value(value[0], new_path)\n    return None\n\nobj = {\"id\": \"e\", \"Z\": \"j\", \"subs\": [{\"id\": \"f\", \"Y\": \"i\", \"subs\": [{\"id\": \"g\", \"X\": \"h\", \"subs\": []}]}]}\nprint(get_value(obj, \"Z.j.subs[0][id].Y\"))  # Prints: i\n```\nThis code recursively searches the provided object for the specified path. It first checks if it finds a \"subs\" field at the first level. If it finds a dictionary, it adds an additional level to the path and recursively searches inside the nested dictionary. If it finds a list, it assumes that the value of interest is at the first element of the list and recursively searches inside that element. Once it finds the value at the specified path, it returns it. If it doesn't find the value at all, it returns None."
