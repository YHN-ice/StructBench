        "It seems like you want to join these two tables on the 'primeKey' column and filter out those rows where the height is greater than 175. Here's how you can do it in SQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*)\nFROM table1\nJOIN table2 ON table1.primeKey = table2.primeKey\nWHERE table1.height > 175;\n```\nThis query first joins `table1` and `table2` on the `primeKey` column, then filters out the rows where the `height` in `table1` is greater than 175. The result is the count of such rows, which represents the number of people who work in Illinois who are taller than 175cm.The problem statement is asking for the count of people who work in CA and are taller than 167. To solve this, we can use SQL to join the two tables on primeKey and filter based on the conditions. Here is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM table1 t1\nJOIN table2 t2 ON t1.primeKey = t2.primeKey\nWHERE t2.location = 'CA' AND t1.height > 167;\n```\n\nThis query first joins table1 and table2 on the primeKey column. It then filters the results to include only those rows where the location is 'CA' and the height is greater than 167. The final result is the count of such rows."
