        "It seems like you want to join these two tables on the 'primeKey' column and filter out those rows where the height is greater than 175. Here's how you can do it in SQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*)\nFROM table1\nJOIN table2 ON table1.primeKey = table2.primeKey\nWHERE table1.height > 175;\n```\nThis query first joins `table1` and `table2` on the `primeKey` column, then filters out the rows where the `height` in `table1` is greater than 175. The result is the count of such rows, which represents the number of people who work in Illinois who are taller than 175cm.The problem statement is asking for the count of people who work in CA and are taller than 167. To solve this, we can use SQL to join the two tables on primeKey and filter based on the conditions. Here is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM table1 t1\nJOIN table2 t2 ON t1.primeKey = t2.primeKey\nWHERE t2.location = 'CA' AND t1.height > 167;\n```\n\nThis query first joins table1 and table2 on the primeKey column. It then filters the results to include only those rows where the location is 'CA' and the height is greater than 167. The final result is the count of such rows.This problem seems to require a SQL query. However, the question doesn't specify the exact database schema or the name of the table that contains the data. I'll make some assumptions for this solution.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The data is stored in two tables named `employees` and `locations`.\n2. The `employees` table has columns `primeKey`, `gender`, `age`, `name`, `height`, `weight`, `color`, `status`, `salary`, `company`, and `location`.\n3. The `locations` table has columns `primeKey` and `location`.\n4. The `location` column in both tables corresponds to the same location, which we are interested in.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM employees e \nJOIN locations l ON e.primeKey = l.primeKey \nWHERE e.height > 167;\n```\n\nThis query joins the `employees` and `locations` tables on the `primeKey` column, and then counts the number of rows where the `height` is greater than 167. This will give you the number of people who work in HI and are taller than 167.This problem requires joining two tables and filtering based on a condition. We will use SQL (Structured Query Language) for this purpose, which is widely used for managing and manipulating relational databases.\n\nHere's the SQL query to solve your problem:\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*)\nFROM people_height\nWHERE height > 171 AND city = 'GA';\n```\n\nIn this query, `people_height` is the name of the table that contains the height information. The `WHERE` clause filters out rows where the height is greater than 171 and the city is 'GA'. The `COUNT(*)` function then counts the number of such rows, which gives us the total number of people who work in GA and are taller than 171cm.The problem statement is a bit confusing as it seems to be repeating the same table multiple times. However, if we assume that each block of data is a separate question and we need to count the number of 'female' and 'male' in each block, the answer would be:\n\nNumber of female in the first block: 2\nNumber of male in the first block: 1\n\nNumber of female in the second block: 2\nNumber of male in the second block: 0\n\nNumber of female in the third block: 1\nNumber of male in the third block: 1\n\nNumber of female in the fourth block: 1\nNumber of male in the fourth block: 3\n\nNumber of female in the fifth block: 0\nNumber of male in the fifth block: 2\n\nNumber of female in the sixth block: 1\nNumber of male in the sixth block: 2\n\nSo, the total number of female is 6 and the total number of male is 8."
