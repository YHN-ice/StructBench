        "Question: What is the height of the root node, i.e., the number of edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf nodes? Answer an integer, leaf is of height 0.\nTo answer the height of tree, you need to take a recursive strategy. For each node, you will find its height by first finding its children's heights. Then, the height of node is the maximum subtree heights plus 1. The base case occurs when a node has no children, i.e., its a leaf node. Leaf's height is defined to be 0, without the need of further queries. Then the height the tree is the height of its root node.\n\nInput: \ne->f\nf->g\ng->h\ng->i\ng->j\ng->k\nf->l\nl->m\nl->n\nl->o\nl->p\nf->q\nq->r\nq->s\nq->t\nq->u\nf->v\nv->w\nv->x\nv->y\nv->z\ne->ab\nab->bb\nbb->cb\nbb->db\nbb->eb\nbb->fb\nab->gb\ngb->hb\ngb->ib\ngb->jb\ngb->kb\nab->lb\nlb->mb\nlb->nb\nlb->ob\nlb->pb\nab->qb\nqb->rb\nqb->sb\nqb->tb\nqb->ub\ne->vb\nvb->wb\nwb->xb\nwb->yb\nwb->zb\nwb->ac\nvb->bc\nbc->cc\nbc->dc\nbc->ec\nbc->fc\nvb->gc\ngc->hc\ngc->ic\ngc->jc\ngc->kc\nvb->lc\nlc->mc\nlc->nc\nlc->oc\nlc->pc\ne->qc\nqc->rc\nrc->sc\nrc->tc\nrc->uc\nrc->vc\nqc->wc\nwc->xc\nwc->yc\nwc->zc\nwc->ad\nqc->bd\nbd->cd\nbd->dd\nbd->ed\nbd->fd\nqc->gd\ngd->hd\ngd->id\ngd->jd\ngd->kd\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "Given the tree structure, we can see that it is composed of several paths starting from the root node 'e'. To find the height of the root node, we need to find the longest path, which is the maximum number of edges from the root 'e' to any leaf node.\n\nWe can observe that the tree is uniformly structured, with each internal node connecting to four children. This pattern repeats at every level down from the root, resulting in each subtree being of equal height. \n\nGiven that every branch from 'e' has a similar structure and depth, we can calculate the height by checking the depth of one branch:\n\n1. e to any of its direct children, such as f (1 edge)\n2. f to any of its children, such as g (1 edge)\n3. g to any of its children, such as h (1 edge)\n\nThe pattern continues with each subsequent level adding one more edge to the count. Since there are four levels from 'e' to the leaf nodes (e.g., from 'e' to 'f', then 'g', then 'h', and finally to a leaf like 'i'), and each level adds one edge, the height of the root node 'e' is:\n\nHeight = 1 (e to f) + 1 (f to g) + 1 (g to h) + 1 (h to a leaf node like 'i') = 4\n\nTherefore, the height of the root node 'e' is 4."
