        "Question: What is the depth of node wc? Answer an integer, root is of depth 0.\nTo find the depth of a node, you need to find the number of edges from root to node. You have to start from the root with depth 0 and assign the depth for each node recursively. For any given node, it gets depth of current depth. Increment the depth by 1 before go to its subtree and repeat the process until every node gets a depth.\n\nInput: \nh->i\ni->j\nj->k\nj->l\nj->m\nj->n\ni->o\no->p\no->q\no->r\no->s\ni->t\nt->u\nt->v\nt->w\nt->x\ni->y\ny->z\ny->ab\ny->bb\ny->cb\nh->db\ndb->eb\neb->fb\neb->gb\neb->hb\neb->ib\ndb->jb\njb->kb\njb->lb\njb->mb\njb->nb\ndb->ob\nob->pb\nob->qb\nob->rb\nob->sb\ndb->tb\ntb->ub\ntb->vb\ntb->wb\ntb->xb\nh->yb\nyb->zb\nzb->ac\nzb->bc\nzb->cc\nzb->dc\nyb->ec\nec->fc\nec->gc\nec->hc\nec->ic\nyb->jc\njc->kc\njc->lc\njc->mc\njc->nc\nyb->oc\noc->pc\noc->qc\noc->rc\noc->sc\nh->tc\ntc->uc\nuc->vc\nuc->wc\nuc->xc\nuc->yc\ntc->zc\nzc->ad\nzc->bd\nzc->cd\nzc->dd\ntc->ed\ned->fd\ned->gd\ned->hd\ned->id\ntc->jd\njd->kd\njd->ld\njd->md\njd->nd\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
