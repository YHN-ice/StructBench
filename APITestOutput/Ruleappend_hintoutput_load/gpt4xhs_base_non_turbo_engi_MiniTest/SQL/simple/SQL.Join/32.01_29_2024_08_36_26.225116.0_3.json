        "The question does not provide actual data tables or additional context, making it impossible to provide a numerical answer. The steps to solve this would involve joining the tables on the 'primeKey', then filtering for rows where 'location' is 'IL' and 'height' is greater than 159. You would then count these filtered rows. However, without actual data, these steps can't be performed to provide a specific answer."
