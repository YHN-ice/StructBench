For example, height might be recorded in different units (centimeters vs. inches).\n\n2. Missing Values: Some entries might have missing information, such as a missing city or height, which would require handling to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: The presence of duplicate rows for the same individual (same primeKey) can lead to overcounting if not addressed properly.\n\n4. Data Quality Issues: There might be errors in the data, such as typos or incorrect values, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n\n5. Large Datasets: If the dataset is very large, performance could be an issue. Efficient algorithms and data structures would be needed to handle the data efficiently.\n\n6. Complex Join Conditions: Sometimes the join condition could be more complex than a simple equality check, requiring additional logic to accurately merge the tables.\n\n7. Data Privacy and Access: If the dataset contains sensitive information, there might be privacy concerns or restrictions on which parts of the data can be used or shared.\n\n8. Ambiguity in Query: The query might be ambiguous in terms of what constitutes \"working in WA\" (e.g., physically located in WA vs. having an employer based in WA).\n\nBefore addressing these challenges, it's crucial to understand the structure of the input files and any constraints or assumptions that apply to them. Once you provide the datasets, I can help you with parsing and analyzing the data according to your query."
