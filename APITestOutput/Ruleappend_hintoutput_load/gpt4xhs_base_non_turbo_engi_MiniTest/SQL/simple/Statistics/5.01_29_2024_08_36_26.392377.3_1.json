Missing or Incorrect Data: Rows may have missing salary data or incorrect entries that could lead to inaccurate counts unless handled properly.\n\n3.

Multiple Tables: If the data is spread across multiple tables, it might be necessary to join or cross-reference these tables correctly using the primeKey or another identifier.\n\n7.
