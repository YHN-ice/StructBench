Duplicate Entries:\n   - There might be duplicate rows for the same person with the same primeKey, which could lead to counting the same female multiple times.\n\n4. Inconsistencies Across Tables:\n   - If there are multiple tables with gender information, they might have different structures or inconsistent use of the primary key.\n\n5.
