This requires normalization of data before comparison.\n\n3. **Data Parsing Errors:** There might be parsing errors due to unexpected data types or corrupt data entries that could cause the parser to fail or produce incorrect counts.\n\n4. **Large Data Sets:** If the table is very large, performance issues could arise. Efficient algorithms and data structures would be needed to handle the data volume without excessive processing time.\n\n5. **Missing or Incomplete Data:** Some rows might have missing salary information, which would require handling for such cases to ensure they don't incorrectly influence the count.\n\n6. **Incorrect Threshold Interpretation:** The parser needs to correctly interpret the threshold value as an exclusive bound (i.e., strictly greater than 230884), to avoid including those who earn exactly the threshold amount.\n\n7. **Data Access Issues:** Depending on the data source, there may be accessibility issues with the file or database that contains the salary information.\n\n8. **Human Error:** Manual errors, such as misreading the threshold or incorrectly counting the number of qualifying entries, could lead to an inaccurate result.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a systematic approach to data parsing and validation is necessary, along with careful verification of results.
