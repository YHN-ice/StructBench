Inconsistent Data Formats: The height might be recorded in different units (feet, inches, meters) or formats across the data entries, requiring conversion to a consistent unit for comparison.\n\n3. Data Errors: There might be errors in the data, such as typos or incorrect values (e.g., a height of '1700' instead of '170'), which could lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. Multiple Entries for the Same Person: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, it's essential to ensure that each person is only counted once, even if they appear in multiple rows after joining the tables.\n\n5. Performance Constraints: If the dataset is very large, performance could be an issue, and efficient parsing and searching algorithms will be needed to process the data in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n6.
