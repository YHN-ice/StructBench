        "Without the actual data and the ability to perform the required join operation and filtering, it's impossible to provide a specific numerical answer to this question. However, the process has been thoroughly explained in the question itself: joining the tables based on the primeKey, and then filtering for the conditions of location (HI) and height (greater than 167). This will provide the count of individuals meeting these criteria. If done correctly, taking into account the potential difficulties and obstacles discussed above, the end result should be accurate."
