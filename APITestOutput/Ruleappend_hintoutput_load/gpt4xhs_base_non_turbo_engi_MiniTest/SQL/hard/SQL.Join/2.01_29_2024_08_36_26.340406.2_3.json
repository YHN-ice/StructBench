This includes making sure that `primeKey` values match correctly across tables, and that height and city values are formatted consistently.\n\n3. **Handling of missing or null values**: If there are missing values in either of the key columns (`primeKey`, `City`, or `Height`), this could affect the accuracy of the join operation and the subsequent filtering.\n\n4. **Data types and comparison**: Ensuring that the data types for height are numerical so that a comparison to a numerical threshold (175) can be made.
