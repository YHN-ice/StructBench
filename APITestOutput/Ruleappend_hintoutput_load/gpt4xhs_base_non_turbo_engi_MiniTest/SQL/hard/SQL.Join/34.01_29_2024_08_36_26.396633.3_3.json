Ensuring that each person is only counted once is crucial.\n\n3. **Missing Data**: If there are missing values in either the primeKey or the fields of interest (city or height), this could complicate the joining process and the filtering of the results.\n\n4. **Large Dataset**: If the tables are very large, there could be performance concerns when joining the data and filtering it. Efficient algorithms and possibly data indexing might be needed to handle large datasets.\n\n5. **Data Type Mismatch**: Different data types for what should be similar columns between tables (e.g., height as a string in one table and an integer in another) could cause errors during the join or comparison operations.\n\n6. **Case Sensitivity**: The names of cities may be case-sensitive. This means that 'GA' and 'ga' would be considered different, so care must be taken to ensure that case sensitivity does not affect the result.\n\n7. **Data Errors**: There might be errors in the data, such as invalid or unrealistic values for height which need to be handled properly.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Conditions**: The threshold for height is specified as strictly greater than 171, but the units of measurement for height aren't specified. If the units in the datasets differ, additional processing might be needed to ensure accurate comparisons.\n\n9. **Multiple Data Formats**: Height could be represented in different units or formats across different rows (e.g., centimeters vs inches), which would require conversion to a consistent unit before comparison.\n\n10. **Sorting and Grouping**: Depending on how the data is structured, sorting or grouping might be necessary to accurately count unique individuals who meet both conditions.\n\nAddressing these potential obstacles requires careful inspection of the data, possibly cleaning and standardizing it, efficient algorithms for joining and filtering, and attention to detail in understanding and applying the conditions specified in the query."
