We need to ensure we only count each person once.\n\n3. **Data Type Conversion**: Salaries might be stored as strings and need to be converted to a numeric type for comparison.\n\n4. **Missing Data**: Some rows could have missing or null salary values, which we need to handle appropriately.\n\n5. **Currency Differences**: If the table contains salary data in different currencies, converting them to a single currency before comparison might be necessary.\n\n6. **Data Size**: If the dataset is very large, performance considerations may be important.\n\n7. **Filtering Non-Numeric Values**: Ensuring that non-numeric values (like text labels or error messages) are not mistakenly counted or cause errors in the process.\n\n8. **Decimal Points and Comma Separators**: Handling decimal points and comma separators correctly, as some regions use commas to denote thousands, which could lead to misinterpretation of the salary values.\n\n9. **Updates and Synchronization**: If the data table is updated in real-time or frequently changes, making sure that the data is synchronized and up-to-date when performing the count.\n\n10. **Accuracy of Data**: The data itself might have inaccuracies or typos, which could affect the outcome of the count if not addressed.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties would require careful implementation of data parsing logic, including validation, type checking, error handling, deduplication of entries, and perhaps normalization of values if necessary."
