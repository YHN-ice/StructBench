The parser needs to account for these variations.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures per Line**: There may be multiple `\\includegraphics` commands on a single line. The parser should be able to extract all filenames even when they are concatenated in this manner.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. If the `\\includegraphics` command is commented out, it should not be considered. So comments need to be handled correctly.\n\n6. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics`. These cases are harder to detect since the parser must understand custom macros expansions.\n\n7. **File Path with Spaces or Special Characters**: Filenames or paths containing spaces or special characters might be enclosed in curly braces `{}`. The parser should properly handle these cases.\n\n8. **Regex Limitations**: Regular expressions used for parsing might not perfectly match the LaTeX command syntax, leading to false positives or negatives.\n\nDealing with these challenges requires a robust parsing approach that understands the syntax and semantics of LaTeX commands and can handle a variety of scenarios that might occur in real-world LaTeX documents."
