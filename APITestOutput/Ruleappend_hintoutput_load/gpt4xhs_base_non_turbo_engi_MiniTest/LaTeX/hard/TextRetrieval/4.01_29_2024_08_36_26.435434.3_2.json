Different users might use different syntax styles, including optional arguments for image scaling, rotation, etc.\n\n2. **File extension omission**: In LaTeX, it's common to omit the file extension of the image being included, as LaTeX can figure out which file to use based on the available files and their extensions. The parser should be prepared to deal with file names without extensions.\n\n3. **Relative and absolute paths**: The file path specified in the `\\includegraphics` command can be either relative to the document directory or an absolute path. The parser should correctly interpret both types.\n\n4. **Path with spaces**: File paths with spaces can be included in LaTeX using quotes or other methods. The parser should handle these cases correctly.\n\n5. **Multiple includegraphics in one line**: There could be multiple `\\includegraphics` commands in a single line, and the parser needs to extract each file name separately.\n\n6. **Comments and commented out includegraphics**: Sometimes, `\\includegraphics` commands may be commented out in the LaTeX source code, and these should not be confused with actual commands that include images.\n\nNow let's see the input file for a more specific parsing task."
