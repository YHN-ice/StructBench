For example, `\\textbf{bold with {inner} braces}` should extract \"bold with {inner} braces\" as bold text.\n\n2. Escape characters: In LaTeX, a backslash before a special character (like a curly brace) escapes it. The parser should recognize escaped characters and not treat them as delimiters. For example, `\\textbf{bold\\} text}` should extract \"bold} text\" rather than terminating at the escaped brace.\n\n3. Other commands within bold text: LaTeX allows other formatting commands within `\\textbf{...}`. The parser must be able to handle cases such as `\\textbf{bold \\emph{and} italic}` and extract the correct text.\n\n4. Split macros: The `\\textbf` and its opening brace might be split across lines or by comments in the LaTeX source, like `\\textbf %comment \\n{bold text}`. The parser should reassemble these.\n\n5. Multiple `\\textbf` instances: The LaTeX file might contain multiple instances of `\\textbf`. The parser must be able to handle all occurrences.\n\n6. Variants of bold commands: Aside from `\\textbf`, there might be custom commands or different ways to indicate bold text in LaTeX that the parser won't catch if it's only looking for `\\textbf`.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, the parser must be robust against these complexities and be able to handle a variety of LaTeX formatting scenarios."
