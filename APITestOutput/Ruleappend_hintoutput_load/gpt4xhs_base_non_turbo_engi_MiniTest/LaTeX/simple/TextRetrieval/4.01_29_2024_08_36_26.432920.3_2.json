For instance, it could be written as `\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{filename}` or `\\includegraphics {filename}`, with different spaces and optional arguments.\n\n2. **File paths and extensions**: The filenames included may contain relative or absolute file paths and might include file extensions (e.g., .png, .jpg, .pdf) or not. Parsing the correct filename requires accounting for these variations.\n\n3. **Line breaks and comments**: The LaTeX commands might be broken over multiple lines or commented out using the `%` symbol, which may make naive pattern matching fail.\n\n4. **Custom commands**: The document may define custom commands that internally use `\\includegraphics`, and thus the pattern to match may not be straightforward.\n\n5. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes, LaTeX users utilize a single \\includegraphics command to include multiple figures side by side, especially within a figure environment with subfigures. These cases need special handling.\n\n6. **Environment variations**: The `\\includegraphics` command could be nested inside other environments, such as `figure`, `minipage`, or `tabular`, which may affect how the command is written and should be parsed.\n\n7. **Brace matching**: Since LaTeX uses braces `{}` for command parameters, accurately identifying the boundaries of the filename requires correctly parsing nested brace levels.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, one would need to write a parser that is robust to these variations and capable of recognizing the relevant patterns regardless of how they are presented in the LaTeX source code."
