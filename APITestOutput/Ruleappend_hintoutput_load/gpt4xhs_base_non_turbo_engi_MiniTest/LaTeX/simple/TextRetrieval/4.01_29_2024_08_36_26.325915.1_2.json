These arguments are placed inside square brackets before the curly braces that contain the filename. The parser must be able to handle these optional arguments without mistaking them for part of the filename.\n\n3. **Path in Filename**: The TARGET can include directory paths, which means the parser should be able to extract the full path as part of the filename.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: LaTeX also supports subfigures or multiple files included in a single command through custom commands or packages like `subfig` or `subcaption`. These would require more complex parsing to extract each filename separately.\n\n5. **Comments and Line Breaks**: The LaTeX file could have comments (`%`) that could potentially \"comment out\" an include command, or there could be line breaks within the `\\includegraphics` command that split the command over several lines. The parser needs to ignore commented lines and handle line breaks correctly.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Users can define custom commands that wrap around `\\includegraphics`, or create custom environments that include graphics. The parser would need to be able to recognize these custom commands and environments as well.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: In LaTeX, it's not mandatory to include the file extension of the image, so the parser should be prepared to extract filenames without extensions as valid targets.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties, we can proceed with parsing once we have access to the LaTeX file content in order to extract all included figure files."
