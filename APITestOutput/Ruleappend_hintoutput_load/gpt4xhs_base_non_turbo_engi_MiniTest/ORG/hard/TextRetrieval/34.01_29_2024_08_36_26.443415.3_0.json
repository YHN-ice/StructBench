These should not be considered as formatting markers for bold text.\n\n6. **Non-Text Characters**: The inclusion of non-text characters or symbols within the bold text might affect the accuracy of the extraction.\n\n7. **Overlapping Formats**: There might be overlapping formatting markers where a section of text is both bold and another format which could make the parsing logic more complex.\n\n8. **Consistent Formatting**: Assuming that the file follows a consistent formatting pattern is key. Inconsistencies in how bold is applied could lead to missed or improperly extracted text.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be able to handle complex regular expressions or use a state machine to track the occurrences of asterisks and determine when they are used as formatting markers versus when they are part of the text.
