While `[[TARGET]]` might be a standard format, there could be variations such as `[[PATH][DESCRIPTION]]` or the inclusion of additional attributes, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Embedded Links:** Sometimes, image files could be part of a larger embedded structure, like a table or a list, which might make it harder to isolate the image links from surrounding text.\n\n4. **Text Similar to Links:** There may be text within the ORG file that resembles the link syntax but isn't an actual link to an image file. We need to discern between actual links and similar-looking text patterns.\n\n5. **Path Resolution:** If the image file paths are relative, we may need additional context to resolve them to actual filesystem paths. However, if only the file names are needed, this might not be an issue.\n\n6. **Multiple Links in One Line:** There might be multiple links in a single line, so ensuring that we capture all image file names without duplication is important.\n\n7. **Non-Image File Links:** There could be links to non-image files in the ORG file. We must ensure that our pattern only captures image files and not other types of files.\n\nBy anticipating these challenges, we can more accurately parse the ORG file for image links and extract the correct file names."
