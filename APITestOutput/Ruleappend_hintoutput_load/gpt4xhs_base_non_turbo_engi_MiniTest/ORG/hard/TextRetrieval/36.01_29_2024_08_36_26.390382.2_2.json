The parser needs to distinguish between these two possibilities.\n\n4. **Relative versus Absolute Paths**: Image file paths could be relative or absolute. The parser should correctly identify the filename in both scenarios.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: File names might contain special characters or spaces that need to be handled properly.\n\n6. **Multiple Links in One Line**: If multiple links exist on the same line, the parser should be able to identify and separate each one.\n\n7. **Non-Image Links**: There may be other non-image links in the file. The parser must differentiate between image files and other types of links.\n\n8. **File Size and Performance**: If the ORG file is large, performance might become an issue, especially if the parser is not optimized for efficiency.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parsing logic should:\n\n- Understand and follow the ORG file syntax rules.\n- Use regular expressions or string parsing techniques that are robust enough to handle variations in link formatting.\n- Filter out only relevant links that point to image files, typically indicated by file extensions like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.\n- Be efficient and manage resources well, especially for large files.\n- Handle edge cases, such as escaped characters or brackets within filenames."
