This can cause confusion and requires careful attention to ensure the correct heading is identified.\n\n3. **Inconsistent formatting:** If the ORG file does not strictly adhere to the expected formatting conventions (i.e., the correct number of asterisks and whitespaces before headings), it may be difficult to accurately identify and parse the different levels of content.\n\n4. **Embedded content:** Within a subsection or subsubsection, there could be various types of content embedded, such as code blocks, lists, or tables. This could make it difficult to extract only the required text without including unrelated content.\n\n5. **Content spread across multiple lines:** The content of the subsubsection may not be confined to a single line and could span multiple lines or paragraphs, which requires careful extraction to include all relevant information.\n\n6. **Nested sub-sections:** If there are other levels of nesting within the subsubsection (e.g., further sub-sub-subsections), it might be challenging to determine where the queried content ends.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful attention must be paid to the structure and formatting of the ORG file, and a methodical approach must be taken to navigate through the hierarchy to extract the correct content."
