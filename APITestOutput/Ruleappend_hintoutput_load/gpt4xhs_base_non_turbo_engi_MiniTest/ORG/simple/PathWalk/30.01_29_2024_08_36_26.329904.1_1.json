I need to ensure I'm extracting the content from the correct section as specified by its ordinal position (e.g., 1st section).\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the ORG file is very large, parsing it efficiently to find the specified section without consuming too much time or resources could be challenging.\n\n5. **Incomplete Structures**: The given ORG file might have incomplete or improperly formatted structures, such as a section heading without corresponding content or missing asterisks.\n\n6. **Character Encoding**: If the ORG file contains characters with special encodings or is not in a standard text format, additional processing might be required to interpret the content correctly.\n\n7. **Inquiry Ambiguity**: The inquiry might lack clarity. For example, if it is not clear whether subsections are included in the query when asking for a section's content, it could lead to providing too much or too little information.\n\nTo handle these potential obstacles, I need to parse the file systematically, maintain flexibility in interpreting formatting variations, keep track of hierarchical structures, and ensure clarity in understanding the query.
