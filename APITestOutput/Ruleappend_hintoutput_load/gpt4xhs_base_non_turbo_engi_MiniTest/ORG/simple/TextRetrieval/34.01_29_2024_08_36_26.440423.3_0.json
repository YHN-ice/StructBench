It's important to correctly identify the bold text without accidentally including surrounding formatting.\n\n2. **Escaping characters**: Sometimes asterisks might be escaped within the text, which means they are not meant to denote bold text but are part of the actual content. The parser must differentiate between actual formatting asterisks and escaped asterisks.\n\n3. **Line breaks and whitespace**: Bold text might span across multiple lines or contain leading or trailing whitespace that should be ignored when extracting the content.\n\n4. **Partial formatting**: There may be instances where an asterisk is intended for formatting but the closing asterisk is missing, which could lead to incorrect extraction or ignoring the text that should have been bold.\n\n5. **Multiple instances of bold text**: The file might contain multiple bold texts following each other without any non-bold text in between. The parser should handle these cases correctly and not merge them into a single bold section.\n\n6. **Consistency in markup usage**: The ORG file might not consistently use a single asterisk for bold text, or it might use it for other purposes like list items or headings. The parser must be strict about the context in which the asterisk is used.\n\n7. **Overlapping formatting**: There might be overlapping formatting, such as when a section of text is both bold and italic. These cases need special attention to ensure correct extraction.\n\n8. **Asterisks within words**: Sometimes asterisks are used within words, like in footnotes or to denote action (e.g., *shrugs*). These should not be confused with formatting marks.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it is essential that the parser is designed with careful consideration of the ORG file's syntax and semantics to ensure accurate extraction of bold texts.
