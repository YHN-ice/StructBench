Nested Markup: ORG files can contain complex nested markup, such as bold text within italicized sections or vice versa.

Markup Similarity: ORG files use asterisks (*) for both bold text and list items, among other things. The parser must distinguish between these uses based on context.\n\n3. Escaped Characters: Asterisks used in the text might be escaped (e.g., \\*) and should not be treated as markup for bold text. The parser needs to correctly handle escaped characters.\n\n4. Incomplete Markup: The input file might contain errors or incomplete markup (e.g., a missing closing asterisk). The parser should be robust enough to handle or report these issues.\n\n5. Multi-line Bold Text: Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser must be able to detect and extract such occurrences correctly.\n\n6. Overlapping Markup: There could be overlapping markup where an asterisk is meant to close one bold section and start another. Handling such cases without errors can be tricky.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I will apply the necessary logic to handle these cases if they arise, and extract the bold texts accordingly."
