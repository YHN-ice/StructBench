Nested Formatting: If the bold text contains other formatting symbols or nested bold tags, it could complicate the extraction process. For example, a line may contain a mixture of italics, underlining, or other ORG mode specific formatting within the bold text.\n\n2. Escaped Characters: In some cases, the asterisk (*) character may be escaped (e.g., \\*) within the text, which means it should not be treated as a formatting marker. Properly distinguishing between escaped and unescaped asterisks is necessary.\n\n3. Multiline Bold Texts: Bold text that spans multiple lines in the ORG file may require a multi-line parsing strategy, which can complicate the parsing logic.\n\n4. Inconsistent Formatting: Users may accidentally misuse formatting characters or leave unclosed formatting tags, resulting in inconsistent formatting that can lead to difficulties in correctly identifying the start and end of bold text.\n\n5. Overlapping Formats: There may be overlapping formatting where a bold section starts within another bold section. Handling such cases requires careful parsing to ensure that all bold text is extracted correctly without duplication or omission.\n\n6. Non-standard Usage: Some users may use the asterisk in non-standard ways, such as for bullet points or other custom uses, which are not intended to indicate bold formatting.\n\n7. Large Input Files: Very large ORG files may introduce performance considerations when parsing and extracting text, requiring efficient algorithms and possibly streaming the file content.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parsing algorithm would need to correctly implement the rules of the ORG file format regarding how bold text is indicated and handle edge cases and exceptions appropriately."
