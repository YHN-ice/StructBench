It would be necessary to correctly identify the bold text without being confused by other markers.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: The asterisk (*) used for bold formatting might be escaped in the text (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which means it should not be treated as a formatting marker.\n\n3. **Inline Codes or Links**: There might be inline codes or links that include asterisks which are not meant for formatting. For example, links with asterisks in the URL or code snippets that contain asterisks as part of the code.\n\n4. **Multiple Bold Sections on the Same Line**: There could be multiple bold sections within a single line, separated by non-bold text.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold text that spans multiple lines could present challenges if the parser is designed to read line by line without considering multiline formatting.\n\n6. **Overlapping Formatting**: There might be overlapping formats such as a section of text that is both italic and bold. The parser will need to handle such cases without confusing the start and end markers for different formatting styles.\n\n7. **Consistent Delimiters**: Ensuring the start (*) and end (*) delimiters for bold text consistently appear in pairs without any missing or extra asterisks.\n\n8. **Text with Asterisks Not Related to Formatting**: Some texts might naturally contain asterisks for reasons other than formatting, such as bullet points or to denote footnotes.\n\n9. **Whitespace Handling**: There may be whitespace immediately following or preceding the asterisk, which could be part of the formatting or accidental.\n\n10. **File Encoding and Line Endings**: The file encoding and line endings (LF vs CRLF) could affect how the text is read and should be handled appropriately.\n\nBy anticipating these challenges, we can approach parsing the ORG file with caution to ensure accurate extraction of bold text."
