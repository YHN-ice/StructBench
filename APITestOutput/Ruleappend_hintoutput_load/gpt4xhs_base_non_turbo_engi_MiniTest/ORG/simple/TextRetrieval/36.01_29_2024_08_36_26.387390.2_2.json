Identifying image file links within such structures might require careful parsing.\n\n2. **Different Link Formats**: Image links could be presented in different formats or surrounded by various markup elements. Consistency in link format must be established to ensure correct extraction.\n\n3. **Embedded vs. External Images**: Images can be either embedded directly into the document or linked from external sources. The parser needs to differentiate between the two.\n\n4. **File Path Variations**: File paths can be absolute or relative, and they might include various directories. The parser must correctly interpret these paths to identify the file names.\n\n5. **Markup Variations**: There could be variations in markup before and after the `[[TARGET]]` pattern, including spaces, different bracket types, additional attributes, or even line breaks that can complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Non-Image File Links**: The ORG file might contain links to other types of files or URLs. The parser must be careful not to extract non-image file names.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters or Special Symbols**: File names might include escaped characters or special symbols that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n8. **Multiple Links on One Line**: There could be lines with multiple links, and the parser must be able to handle and extract all image links from such lines.\n\n9. **Comments or Inactive Links**: Some links might be commented out or inactive, and depending on the requirements, the parser may need to ignore these.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: Character encoding issues might cause problems when reading the file or interpreting certain characters within file names.\n\nCrafting a robust extraction process requires addressing these challenges to avoid incorrect or incomplete extraction of image file names."
