It's essential to handle each type correctly to access the data required.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues:** If the JSON file includes special characters or is encoded in a non-standard format, it may cause parsing issues.\n\n6. **Array Indexing:** Since JSON arrays are zero-indexed, it's important to remember to access the first element with index `0`.\n\n7. **Key Sensitivity:** JSON keys are case-sensitive. It's important to use the exact key as per the file to access the correct value.\n\n8. **Missing or Null Values:** The required data might be missing or set to null; handling such cases without errors is crucial.\n\n9. **Multiple or Inconsistent Data Formats:** If there are multiple objects with different structures or inconsistent formats within the JSON file, it can complicate parsing.\n\n10. **Software/Library Limitations:** Depending on the tools or libraries utilized for parsing, there might be limitations or peculiarities in handling JSON data that could affect retrieving the desired information.\n\nTo overcome these potential obstacles, one must ensure proper handling of all possible edge cases and verify that the JSON file is well-formed.
