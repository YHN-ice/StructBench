Missing or Inconsistent Data:\n   - The \"subs\" list might be empty or not exist at all, so there would be no first object or id to retrieve.\n   - The objects within the \"subs\" list might not have an \"id\" field, or the field name might vary (e.g., ID, Id, identifier), causing inconsistency.\n\n4. Data Type Issues:\n   - The id of the first object in the \"subs\" list could be of a different data type than expected (e.g., integer instead of string), possibly requiring type conversion or handling.\n\n5. Size and Performance Concerns:\n   - The JSON file could be very large, which might impact the performance of the parser or the system's memory capacity.\n   - If an application requires real-time parsing of the JSON data, performance optimization might be necessary.\n\n6.
