It would require careful handling to avoid excessive memory usage or long processing times.\n\n3. **Nested Structures**: JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays. The level of nesting could be deep, and one must understand the structure well to navigate to the correct element.\n\n4. **Key Names**: If the key names are not consistent or if there's a typo in the key 'subs', it could lead to not finding the required list.\n\n5. **Empty or Missing 'subs' List**: If the 'subs' list is empty or missing from the outermost object, it would be impossible to find the first object's id within it.\n\n6. **Data Types**: JSON supports different data types (string, number, object, array, boolean, null). The parser must handle each type correctly; for example, it should not assume that an id is necessarily a string.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the file has encoding issues, some characters may not be read correctly, leading to potential misinterpretation of the data.\n\n8. **Access Permissions**: If the file is on a remote server or in a protected directory, there might be access permission issues that prevent reading the file.\n\nTo address these obstacles, a robust JSON parser would validate the format, handle large files efficiently, navigate nested structures accurately, manage different data types effectively, and deal with encoding and permission issues smoothly."
