This means we must differentiate between an empty \"subs\" and a \"subs\" containing further nestable objects.\n\n3. **Recursive Parsing**: To find the most deeply nested objects, a recursive approach is often required. This must be implemented correctly to avoid infinite loops or missing out on certain branches of the JSON structure.\n\n4. **Multiple Most Deeply Nested Objects**: There might be multiple objects that are the most deeply nested. We need to make sure to identify all of them and not just stop at the first one found.\n\n5. **Identifying Exact Structure**: Preserving the exact structure of the most deeply nested object as it appears in the JSON file might be a challenge, as the process of extracting these objects might manipulate the original formatting.\n\n6. **Performance Issues**: If the JSON file is extremely large, running a recursive search could potentially lead to performance issues, including high memory consumption or long processing times.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: Ensuring that errors in the JSON structure (like missing fields or incorrect types) are handled gracefully in order to still output the correct result.\n\n8. **Correct Output Formatting**: Presenting the extracted most deeply nested objects in the required format, separated by \\n\\n, while maintaining their original JSON structure and formatting.\n\nTo address these potential difficulties, one would need to carefully design the algorithm to handle recursion, maintain accurate tracking of depth, process each node correctly based on its content, and output results in the specified format."
