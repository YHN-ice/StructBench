Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of giving the correct answer:\n\n1. **Missing Commas**: JSON elements should be separated by commas. A missing comma between elements can result in a syntax error.\n\n2. **Trailing Commas**: JSON does not support trailing commas at the end of lists or objects, which could lead to an error.\n\n3. **Mismatched Braces and Brackets**: Each opening curly brace `{` must be paired with a closing curly brace `}`. Similarly, each opening bracket `[` must be paired with a closing bracket `]`. Unmatched braces or brackets can cause parsing to fail.\n\n4. **Improper Quotation Marks**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double-quotes. Single quotes, unquoted keys, or mismatched quotes can result in errors.\n\n5. **Incorrect Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types like string, number, object, array, boolean, and null. Assigning an incorrect data type to a value could lead to issues.\n\n6. **Extra Characters**: Any characters outside of the JSON structure, such as leading or trailing text, can cause a parsing error.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains characters that are not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), it might lead to parsing errors.\n\nDetecting these errors typically involves running the JSON through a parser and looking for exception messages that indicate the type of syntax issue encountered. If there's an error, the parser should specify where in the JSON the error occurs to aid in troubleshooting."
