A common error is the inclusion of an extra comma after the last element or omission of a comma between elements.\n\n2. **Mismatched Brackets**: JSON uses curly braces for objects and square brackets for arrays. An error could be an opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket or vice versa.\n\n3. **Improper Quotes**: JSON requires double quotes for strings and for the keys in objects. Missing quotes or the use of single quotes can cause an error.\n\n4. **Invalid Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Using an unsupported data type or incorrect formatting (e.g., unquoted strings) would be an error.\n\n5. **Unescaped Characters**: Certain characters in strings need to be escaped with a backslash (e.g., quotation marks inside a string).\n\n6. **Trailing Commas**: Although some parsers allow it, trailing commas after the last element in arrays or objects are not permitted in strict JSON.\n\n7. **Nested Structures**: Errors can occur in the nesting of arrays and objects if they are not properly opened and closed.\n\n8. **Key-Value Pair Structure**: Every key must be followed by a colon and then a value. Errors can include missing colons or key/value pairs.\n\n9. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8, and encoding errors could lead to parsing problems.\n\nTo accurately identify structural errors, one must systematically check for all of these potential issues within the JSON file."
