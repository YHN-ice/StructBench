Arrays: If the structure includes arrays, we need to determine the correct index to access the desired element, which may require iterating through the array.\n\n3. Similar Keys: The JSON might contain multiple keys with the same name at different levels or within arrays, which complicates identifying the correct path to the specific value we are interested in.\n\n4. Large JSON Files: A very large JSON file may cause performance issues or make it harder to manually trace the path, especially if the search is not optimized.\n\n5. Dynamic Structures: If the JSON structure is dynamic and changes frequently, it might be hard to write a generic parser that can reliably find the value for different variations of the structure.\n\n6. Error Handling: The parser must handle various potential errors such as missing keys, null values, or unexpected data types.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we need to:\n\n- Implement a recursive search function that keeps track of the path as it traverses the object.\n- Check for the presence of keys before trying to access their values to avoid errors.\n- Use conditional statements and loops to handle arrays and iterate through possible indexes.\n- Keep track of visited paths to avoid infinite loops in case of circular references within the JSON structure.\n\nNow that we have considered potential issues, please provide the JSON file so we can proceed with finding the path to access the value \"wy\"."
