Missing or extra commas: Each key-value pair should be separated by a comma, except for the last pair in an object or array. An error could be caused by a missing comma between pairs, or an extra comma after the last pair.\n\n2. Missing quotation marks: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Missing quotes around these can cause a parsing error.\n\n3. Incorrect Brackets: Curly braces `{}` should enclose objects, and square brackets `[]` should enclose arrays. Mismatched or incorrectly nested brackets can cause errors.\n\n4. Trailing commas: A comma after the last key-value pair in an object or array is not allowed in JSON.\n\n5. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types like string, number, object, array, boolean, and null. Inserting an unsupported data type or incorrectly formatting a value can result in an error.\n\n6. Unescaped characters: Special characters in strings need to be escaped using a backslash `\\`. Unescaped characters can break the JSON structure.\n\nWhen checking for structural errors, I will look for these potential issues. If any of these errors are present, I will report them accordingly.
