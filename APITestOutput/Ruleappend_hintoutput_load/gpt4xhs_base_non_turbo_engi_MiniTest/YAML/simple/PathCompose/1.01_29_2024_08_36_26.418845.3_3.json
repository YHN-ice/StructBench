Understanding how these references work is vital for correct value access.\n\n6. **Recursive Structures**: If the YAML structure has recursive elements, it could be difficult to programmatically determine the correct path without ending in an infinite loop.\n\n7. **Field Exclusion**: If the instructions require ignoring certain fields like 'subs' while searching, the parser must have logic to skip these during the search.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: The parser should gracefully handle errors such as missing keys or indices out of range, which might occur if the file is not structured as expected.\n\nOnce we have the input YAML file, we'll have a better understanding of the specific challenges presented by its structure and content."
