It's important to properly traverse these structures to reach the desired element.\n\n3. **Aliases and anchors:** YAML allows the use of aliases and anchors which can create references to other parts of the document. If used within the file, the parser must be able to resolve these references.\n\n4. **Data types:** YAML supports various data types (strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, etc.). Ensuring that data is correctly interpreted and handled is crucial, especially when accessing specific object properties like `id`.\n\n5. **Large files and performance:** For very large YAML files, there might be performance considerations. Efficient parsing is important to ensure timely retrieval of information.\n\n6. **Variability in object keys:** The keys used in YAML objects might vary or be unexpected. The parser must handle cases where keys are different from what's anticipated.\n\n7. **Multiple documents in one file:** A single YAML file can contain multiple documents, separated by `---`. The parser needs to know which document to process if this is the case.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust YAML parsing library or tool that can handle these complexities should be used. Furthermore, the parser should have error handling mechanisms to deal with potential issues in the YAML structure or content."
