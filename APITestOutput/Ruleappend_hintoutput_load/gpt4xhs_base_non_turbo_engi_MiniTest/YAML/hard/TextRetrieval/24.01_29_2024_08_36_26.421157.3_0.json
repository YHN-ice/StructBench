Ensuring that the search algorithm correctly handles these types without errors is crucial.\n\n4. **Aliases and anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors, which can lead to multiple references to the same object. It is important to handle these correctly to avoid infinite loops or incorrect results.\n\n5. **Large files**: If the YAML file is particularly large, it might be difficult to process efficiently, especially if the entire file needs to be loaded into memory.\n\n6. **Syntactical correctness**: YAML syntax must be correct; any syntax errors could prevent successful parsing of the file.\n\n7. **Matching criteria**: The criteria for matching the object need to be clear—whether it's just the id field or if other attributes should also be considered for identifying the object.\n\nTo address these issues, a robust recursive search algorithm that can handle different data types, check for unique identifiers, and efficiently process potentially large files must be implemented.
