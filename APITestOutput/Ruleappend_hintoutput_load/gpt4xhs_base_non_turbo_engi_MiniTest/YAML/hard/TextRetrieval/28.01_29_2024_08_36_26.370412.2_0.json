Recursion or a stack-based approach may be needed to navigate through the levels.\n\n2. **Multiple Objects with the Same ID**: If the YAML file contains multiple objects with the same `id`, it is important to clarify whether to return the first occurrence or all occurrences.\n\n3. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be resource-intensive to parse and search through the entire structure. Memory management and efficient searching algorithms would be crucial.\n\n4. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types (strings, numbers, arrays, etc.), so ensuring correct handling of these when parsing and comparing values is necessary.\n\n5. **Aliases and References**: YAML supports aliases and anchors which can create references to other parts of the document. This can complicate the search as it may be necessary to resolve these references correctly.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: While YAML aims to be human-friendly, inconsistent formatting or indentation might lead to parsing errors or difficulties in interpreting the structure.\n\n7. **Syntactic Validity**: Invalid YAML syntax could result in parsing errors, so it's important that the input file is syntactically valid.\n\n8. **Key Names**: The search relies on consistent naming of keys (such as `id` and `subs`). If these keys vary in naming or capitalization, it could complicate the search process.\n\n9. **Missing Information**: If there is no object with the specified `id`, handling the absence of a result must be considered.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, it's important to have a robust parser that can handle various edge cases, ensure that the YAML syntax is valid, potentially provide mechanisms for large file handling, and clearly specify how to handle scenarios with multiple matches or missing information."
