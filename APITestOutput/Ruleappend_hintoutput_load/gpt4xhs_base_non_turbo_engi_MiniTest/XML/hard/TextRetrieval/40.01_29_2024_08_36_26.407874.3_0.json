Content within tags might include these escaped characters, which must be interpreted correctly.\n\n7. **Whitespace and Formatting**: XML files can contain whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) that may not be relevant to the content but need to be handled during parsing.\n\n8. **Encoding**: The XML encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1) should be handled correctly to ensure that characters are interpreted as intended.\n\n9. **Comments and Processing Instructions**: The XML may contain comments (`<!-- ... -->`) or processing instructions (`<? ... ?>`) that should not be mistaken for content.\n\n10. **CDATA Sections**: Content within CDATA sections (`<![CDATA[...]]>`) is not parsed by the XML parser and should be extracted as-is.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust XML parsing approach is needed that can handle these issues gracefully while extracting the desired content accurately."
