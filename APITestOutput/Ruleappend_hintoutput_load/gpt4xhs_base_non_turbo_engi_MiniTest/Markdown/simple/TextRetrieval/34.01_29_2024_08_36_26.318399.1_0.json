We need to determine whether to include these as part of the bold text or to strip them out.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows the escaping of special characters using a backslash (\\). If a user has escaped the double asterisks (\\**text\\**), it should not be treated as bold.\n\n3. **Incomplete Tags**: In some cases, there might be unmatched or incomplete bold syntax (e.g., **bold without closure). Deciding how to handle these cases can affect the output.\n\n4. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text in Markdown can span across multiple lines. While searching for bold patterns, one must consider multiline scenarios.\n\n5. **Nested Bold Tags**: It's possible to have nested bold tags within each other. Careful parsing is required to ensure correct extraction.\n\n6. **Alternative Syntax**: Besides double asterisks (**), Markdown also supports double underscores (__) for bolding text. The parser should consider both syntaxes if instructed.\n\n7. **Overlapping Bold and Italic**: In Markdown, you can have overlapping bold and italic by using triple asterisks (***bold and italic***). Parsing out just the bold part could be tricky in such scenarios.\n\n8. **Code Blocks**: Text within code blocks (indented with 4 spaces or between triple backticks) should not be interpreted as formatted text.\n\n9. **List and Blockquote Interruption**: Lists and blockquotes can interrupt the flow of paragraphs and may contain bold text that needs to be parsed correctly.\n\n10. **Performance**: Depending on the size of the Markdown file, parsing performance can be a concern, especially if we're dealing with a very large document.\n\n11. **Invalid Markdown**: Users might make mistakes in their Markdown syntax that could lead to ambiguous or invalid formatting, making it challenging to decide what constitutes bold text.\n\n12. **Special Cases and Ambiguity**: Markdown does not have a strict specification, so different implementations might handle edge cases differently, leading to potential ambiguity in parsing.\n\nGiven these challenges, a robust parsing strategy must be flexible enough to handle a wide variety of Markdown formatting edge cases."
