When parsing, we need to ensure that we can handle such nested structures properly without confusion.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters:** Double asterisks (`**`) could be escaped to display literal asterisks in the text rather than for emphasis. Our parser needs to recognize escaped sequences to avoid false positives.\n\n3. **Inline Code Blocks:** Text within inline code blocks (enclosed with backticks `) should not be parsed as formatted text. Bold markers within these blocks should be ignored.\n\n4. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks:** Similar to inline code blocks, content within code blocks (indented by four spaces or tab) or fenced code blocks (enclosed by triple backticks or tildes) should not be parsed for formatting.\n\n5. **Incorrectly Paired Markers:** The Markdown might contain incorrectly paired asterisks which do not form a valid bold marker. We must ensure that we only consider valid pairs.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Sections on the Same Line:** There may be multiple bold sections within a single line, each enclosed by double asterisks. The parser needs to identify each section separately.\n\n7. **Line Breaks Within Bold Text:** Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser should concatenate these correctly.\n\n8. **Asterisks Within URLs or as Bullet Points:** Asterisks are also used for other purposes in Markdown, such as for creating bullet points or within URLs. These should not be confused with bold markers.\n\n9. **False Positives with Single Asterisks:** Markdown uses single asterisks for italic text (`*italic*`). The parser should not misidentify these as bold.\n\n10. **Variations in Markdown Flavors:** Different implementations of Markdown may have slight variations in how they interpret the syntax, so the parser should ideally be aligned with the specific flavor being used.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, our parser must account for these potential issues and correctly interpret the Markdown syntax to discern when text is intended to be bolded between the double asterisk pairs."
