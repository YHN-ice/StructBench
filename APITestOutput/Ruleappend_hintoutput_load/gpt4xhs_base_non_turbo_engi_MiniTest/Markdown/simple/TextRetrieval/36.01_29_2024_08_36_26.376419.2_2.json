While the basic syntax is `![alt text](URL \"Title\")`, there might be variations such as missing alt text, title, or different use of quotation marks.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: The TARGET part in the image syntax can be a relative path to a file within the same repository or an absolute URL pointing to an external resource. Identifying which image files are local and which are external might be required.\n\n3. **Reference-style links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL part of the image is not included inline but is instead referenced at a different place in the document. This requires correlating references with their definitions.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax might be escaped to prevent them from being parsed, which could potentially obscure the presence of an image file.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown elements**: An image link could be nested within other Markdown elements, such as within a list item or a blockquote, which might complicate extraction.\n\n6. **Non-standard extensions**: Some Markdown processors support non-standard extensions that could affect how images are embedded or formatted.\n\n7. **Errors in the Markdown**: The file might contain typos or errors in the Markdown syntax, which could lead to images not being properly displayed or detected.\n\n8. **Performance and efficiency**: If the Markdown file is exceptionally large, parsing it efficiently while still accurately extracting all image files could be a challenge.\n\nTo ensure an accurate extraction of image filenames, the parser needs to be robust enough to handle these potential issues."
