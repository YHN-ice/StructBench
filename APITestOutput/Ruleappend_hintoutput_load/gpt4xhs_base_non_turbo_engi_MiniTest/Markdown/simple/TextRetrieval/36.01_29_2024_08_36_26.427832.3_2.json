For example, some might use different characters to denote alt text or the title text, or some might omit the title text altogether.\n\n2. **Complexity in Image URLs**: Image filenames can have complex URLs, with parameters and anchors, or they could be simple filenames. The parser must be able to handle both simple and complex cases.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might use inline HTML tags for images. These would not match the Markdown image syntax and may require a different parsing strategy.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Some filenames might include characters that are typically used as escape characters in Markdown, such as backslashes or Markdown-specific characters like parentheses and brackets that aren't part of the filename but rather part of the Markdown formatting.\n\n5. **False Positives**: There might be text that looks like Markdown image syntax but isn't actually meant to be an image reference (for example, it could be within a code block or quoted text).\n\n6. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There may be multiple images on one line, so the parser must be able to handle multiple matches within a single line of text.\n\n7. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support non-standard extensions, which could affect how images are parsed and recognized.\n\n8. **Incorrect Syntax**: Users might make mistakes in the Markdown syntax, which could lead to potential errors in parsing if not accounted for.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser will need to be robust, with a good understanding of possible variations in Markdown syntax, and it will need to handle edge cases appropriately. It should ignore false positives and be able to extract filenames correctly even from complex URLs or non-standard syntax."
