While the most common syntax is `![alt text](URL \"Title\")`, some users may omit the title, the alt text, or use different quotation marks, which can complicate the parsing.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links can be relative to the location of the Markdown file or absolute URLs. It would be important to distinguish between these and decide if only local image files should be considered or if all image references need extraction.\n\n3. **Inline vs. Reference Style Links**: Markdown allows for inline links (where the URL is directly in the link) and reference style links (where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document). Handling both styles could be challenging.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Image paths or alt text might include escape characters that need to be properly handled or stripped out during parsing.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown**: Images may be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or tables, which may complicate parsing if not accounted for.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: It might be necessary to verify file extensions to ensure that what is being extracted is indeed an image file and not some other type of file.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors extend the standard syntax, so a parser would need to be aware of these to handle such cases correctly.\n\n8. **Handling Errors or Irregularities**: There may be errors or irregularities in the Markdown file such as missing parentheses, brackets, or incorrect nesting, which would need to be robustly handled. \n\n9. **Performance Concerns**: If dealing with very large Markdown documents with many images, performance considerations may become important when implementing a parser.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties will inform the approach taken to accurately extract image filenames from the given Markdown file."
