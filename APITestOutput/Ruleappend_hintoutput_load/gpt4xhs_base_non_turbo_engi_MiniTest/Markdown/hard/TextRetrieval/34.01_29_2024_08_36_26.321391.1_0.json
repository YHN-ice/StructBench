Nested Emphasis: Markdown syntax allows for nested emphasis, e.g., **bold *italic* text**. Care must be taken to ensure that only the outermost bold markers are used to identify the bold text.\n\n2. Escaped Characters: Users might escape the double asterisk characters with a backslash to display them literally (e.g., \\**not bold\\**). These should not be counted as bold markers.\n\n3. Inline Code Blocks: Text within inline code blocks (using backticks `) should not contain any Markdown formatting, so any bold markers within code blocks should be ignored.\n\n4. Multiple Bold Segments on One Line: A single line may contain multiple bold segments, each of which needs to be captured independently (e.g., **bold1** some text **bold2**).\n\n5. Overlapping or Unclosed Markers: In the case of malformed Markdown where double asterisks are not properly closed or overlapping, it's necessary to determine how to handle these instances, as they may not represent intentional bold formatting.\n\n6. Code Fences: Code blocks fenced by triple backticks (```) should be treated as preformatted code and any Markdown syntax within them should be ignored.\n\n7. False Positives: Asterisks used in bullet lists or other contexts could potentially be mistaken for emphasis markers.\n\n8. Multiline Bold Text: Bold text that spans across multiple lines needs to be considered, ensuring that the entire bold passage is extracted.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parsing logic must be robust enough to differentiate between actual bold syntax and other uses of the double asterisk characters. It also needs to respect the context in which the double asterisks appear, such as within code blocks or as escaped characters."
