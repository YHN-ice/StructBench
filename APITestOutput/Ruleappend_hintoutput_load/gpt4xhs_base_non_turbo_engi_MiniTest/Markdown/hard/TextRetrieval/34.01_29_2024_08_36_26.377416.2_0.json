For example, `**bold _and_ italic**`.\n\n2. **Escaped characters**: If the asterisks are escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold**`), they should not be interpreted as formatting markers, but as literal asterisks.\n\n3. **Incomplete markers**: Text might have an odd number of asterisks, which could lead to incorrectly identifying bold text. For instance, `**bold text** with a stray **asterisk*`.\n\n4. **Multiple paragraphs**: Bold text might span across multiple paragraphs or list items, which requires the parser to handle multiline strings.\n\n5. **Overlapping ranges**: Occasionally, there may be overlapping bold ranges. To correctly interpret these, the parser must track the start and end markers accurately.\n\n6. **Inconsistent formatting**: Users might not always use Markdown formatting consistently, leading to edge cases where bold text is not marked up correctly (e.g., `** bold**` with a space after the opening asterisks).\n\n7. **Alternative syntax**: Markdown supports alternative syntax for bold text such as using `__` (double underscores) instead of `**` (double asterisks). The parser needs to accommodate alternative syntax as well.\n\n8. **Code blocks**: Text within code blocks should not be parsed as formatted text. For example, in ```` ``` **not bold** ``` ```` the content should not be treated as bold.\n\n9. **Links or images**: Bold markers might be found within the syntax for links or images, which might need special handling to avoid extracting non-bold text.\n\n10. **Performance considerations**: For very large files, the efficiency of the parsing algorithm could be a concern, needing optimizations for quicker processing.\n\nEach of these potential issues requires careful consideration in the design of the Markdown parser so that it can accurately identify and extract all bold texts."
