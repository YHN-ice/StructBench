This nesting may affect how we search for and extract the image filenames.\n\n3. **Non-Standard Characters**: Filenames may contain a variety of characters, including spaces, hyphens, underscores, and periods. The parser must be flexible enough to correctly identify these filenames.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: The Markdown may use escape characters that could affect parsing, such as `\\!` which would indicate that the `!` should be treated as a regular character rather than part of an image link.\n\n5. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links could be relative or absolute paths, and the parser must be able to correctly extract the filename in each case.\n\n6. **Additional Attributes**: Markdown or its extensions might allow additional attributes for images (such as classes, ids, or styles). These should not be confused with the filename.\n\n7. **Links Without Images**: There might be links in the Markdown that are not images (regular hyperlinks), so the parser needs to differentiate between these and image links.\n\n8. **Invalid Markdown**: The file could contain errors or non-standard usage that doesn't strictly follow Markdown rules, which could complicate parsing.\n\nTo overcome these potential issues, the parser should strictly adhere to the specified pattern `![*](TARGET \"*\")` where `TARGET` is the filename and consider the variations that might occur within this pattern."
