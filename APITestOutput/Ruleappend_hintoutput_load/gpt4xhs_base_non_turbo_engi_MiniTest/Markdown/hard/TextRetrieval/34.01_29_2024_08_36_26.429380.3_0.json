Markdown syntax is designed to be simple, but when dealing with real-world documents, several issues may arise:\n\n1. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might contain other elements such as links, italic text, inline code, or even other bold markers. It will be necessary to ignore the nested markers and only focus on the outermost bold markers.\n   \n2. **Escaped characters**: Markdown allows escaping of special characters using a backslash `\\`. If a user wants to include literal double asterisks in their text, they would escape it like `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to recognize and not treat escaped asterisks as bold markers.\n\n3. **Unbalanced markers**: In some cases, there might be unbalanced bold markers (e.g., three asterisks in a row `***` or a single asterisk `*` used instead of double `**`). It's important to define how to handle such cases.\n\n4. **Incorrectly formatted Markdown**: Sometimes the intended bold text is not properly formatted (e.g., there's whitespace between the asterisks and the text `** not bold **`). The parser must decide whether to be strict about the syntax or allow some flexibility.\n\n5. **Multiple bold sections**: A document may have multiple bold sections. All instances must be identified and extracted.\n\n6. **Newlines within bold sections**: Bold text may span multiple lines, so the parser should be able to handle multiline bold text correctly.\n\n7. **Overlapping formatting**: There might be overlapping formatting where italic and bold syntax overlaps (e.g., `***bold and italic***`). The parser needs to decide which formatting to prioritize or how to handle the overlapping.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll need to apply these considerations when extracting the bold text."
