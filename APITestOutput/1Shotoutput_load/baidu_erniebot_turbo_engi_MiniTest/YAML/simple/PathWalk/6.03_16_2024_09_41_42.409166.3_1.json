If the file is not properly indented, it may not be parsed correctly.\n2. **File Size**: If the YAML file is very large, it may be difficult to locate the relevant section without proper navigation or search capabilities.\n3. **Complex Structure**: The YAML file might contain nested structures that can be complex to navigate. Understanding the hierarchy is crucial to correctly identify the requested object.\n4. **Ambiguity**: If there are multiple `subs` sections or the term `subs` is used in different contexts, it might not be clear which one is being referred to without additional information.\n5. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If the `subs` section is not in the first document, this could be overlooked.\n6. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors which can create references within the file. If used, resolving these references might be necessary to answer the question accurately.\n7. **Data Types**: The `id` could be a string, number, or another data type, and I will need to report it in its correct form.\n\nPlease provide the YAML content or further details so that I can assist you with your query about the first object's `id` within the `subs` array."
