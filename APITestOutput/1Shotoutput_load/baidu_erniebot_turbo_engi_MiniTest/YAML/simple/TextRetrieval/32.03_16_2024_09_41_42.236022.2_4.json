Identifying the most deeply nested objects requires careful tracking of the current depth as we traverse the structure.\n\n2. **Aliases & Anchors**: YAML supports the use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) which can create references to previously defined nodes. This can complicate parsing as the referenced node may need to be considered in multiple contexts.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Indentation**: While YAML typically uses indentation to denote structure, inconsistent indentation can lead to parsing errors or incorrect interpretation of the depth of nested objects.\n\n4. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. Each document needs to be parsed separately.\n\n5. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types including sequences (lists), mappings (dictionaries), scalars (strings, integers, etc.), and complex types like timestamps or custom user-defined types. The parser needs to handle these correctly.\n\n6. **Implicit vs Explicit Typing**: YAML has rules for implicit typing based on the value's format. For instance, a value that looks like a number will be interpreted as a number unless explicitly quoted to be a string. We need to ensure that the values are correctly interpreted according to their intended types.\n\nTo overcome these challenges and accurately identify the most deeply nested objects that are not of type list or dict, we will need to parse the file while keeping a stack or a counter to know the current depth at all times and appropriately handle the aforementioned YAML features."
