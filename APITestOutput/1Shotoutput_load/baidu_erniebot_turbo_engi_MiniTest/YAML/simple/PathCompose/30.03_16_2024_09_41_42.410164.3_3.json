You must understand the hierarchy and how to navigate through nested dictionaries and lists.\n\n2. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and booleans. Ensuring the correct data type is being accessed or converted is important for accurately retrieving values.\n\n3. **Key Sensitivity**: YAML keys are case-sensitive, which means that `key`, `Key`, and `KEY` would be considered different. Accurate key names are crucial for retrieving the correct value.\n\n4. **Hyphen Usage**: In YAML, a hyphen is used to create items in a list. It's important not to confuse a hyphen indicating a list item with a hyphen within a key or string value.\n\n5. **Whitespace Sensitivity**: Indentation is significant in YAML and is used to denote structure. The number of spaces used for indentation must be consistent throughout the file.\n\n6. **Special Characters**: Keys or values containing special characters or reserved indicators (such as colons, commas, or brackets) might need special handling, especially if they aren't quoted properly.\n\n7. **Aliases & References**: YAML allows defining aliases and anchors, which can be referenced elsewhere in the document. Understanding these references is important to get the correct data.\n\n8. **Comments**: Comments (starting with `#`) should be ignored when parsing, but they can sometimes obscure the structure if not clearly separated from the actual data.\n\n9. **Multiline Strings**: Handling multiline strings or folded text (`>`) can be tricky, especially when trying to preserve the intended formatting.\n\n10. **Variable Substitution**: Some YAML parsers support variable substitution within the file, which could affect the value being accessed if not properly handled.\n\nEach of these could affect how you access a specific value in a YAML document.
