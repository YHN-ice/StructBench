If the object with id `y` is nested within other structures, it can be tricky to trace its path correctly.\n\n3. **References & Aliases**: YAML allows the definition of aliases using `&` and references using `*`. If the object with id `y` is referenced via an alias, one must resolve this reference to get the actual content.\n\n4. **Data Types**: YAML automatically determines data types, and sometimes the data might not be interpreted as expected (e.g., a yes/no value being interpreted as boolean when it's intended as a string).\n\n5. **Multiple Documents in One File**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. Ensuring that the search for the object with id `y` spans across the correct document is important.\n\n6. **Inclusion of Other Files**: Some YAML files may reference external files or include content from them using tags. If such functionality is expected, it could complicate extracting information from just one file.\n\n7. **Comments**: YAML allows comments, which might contain misleading information or identifiers that are not actual parts of the data structure.\n\n8. **Large Files and Performance**: If the YAML file is very large, parsing it and finding a specific object might be resource-intensive and slow.\n\nThese are just a few challenges that might arise.
