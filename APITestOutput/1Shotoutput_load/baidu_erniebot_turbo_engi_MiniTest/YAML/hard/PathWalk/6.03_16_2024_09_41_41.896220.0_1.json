Understanding and navigating through nested objects and arrays could be challenging if the structure is deeply nested or complex.\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors to reuse content across the document. If used, it may require additional logic to resolve these references correctly.\n\n5. **Non-Standard Extensions**: Some YAML files might use non-standard extensions or custom tags which are not part of the core YAML specification. Handling these might require special consideration.\n\n6. **Large Files**: Large YAML files with a lot of data might pose performance challenges or make it harder to quickly find the relevant section of data.\n\n7. **Special Characters**: Special characters in keys or strings may need to be handled carefully, especially if they have a specific meaning in YAML syntax (like colons, commas, etc.).\n\n8. **Variations in Versions**: Different versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) might have slightly different rules or features, so ensuring compatibility with the version at hand is necessary.\n\nOnce we have the actual YAML input, we would need to carefully parse it keeping in mind these potential issues to extract the required information accurately."
