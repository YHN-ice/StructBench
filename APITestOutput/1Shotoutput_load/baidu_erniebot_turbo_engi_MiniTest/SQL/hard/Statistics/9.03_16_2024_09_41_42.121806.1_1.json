Inconsistencies such as different formats for salary values (e.g., with or without commas or currency symbols) might complicate the parsing process.\n\n2. **Large Dataset**: If the datatable is exceptionally large, it may take significant time and computing resources to process the information.\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries**: The same individual might be listed more than once if the table contains multiple entries per person (as indicated by the same primeKey). Care must be taken not to count these duplicates in the total.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the salary field is treated as a numerical value rather than a string is crucial. If not, comparing the salaries to a numerical threshold may not work as expected.\n\n5. **Missing Data**: If there are any missing or null values in the salary field, they will need to be handled appropriately during the analysis.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structures**: If the datatable has a complex structure, such as nested tables or non-standard formats, extracting the relevant data can be difficult.\n\n7. **Performance Issues**: For large datasets or complex queries, performance may be an issue, especially if using less efficient methods of filtering or searching through data.\n\n8. **Incorrect Data**: There is always the possibility that the data may contain incorrect entries which could lead to inaccurate results.\n\nUnderstanding and mitigating these potential issues in advance can help ensure that the process of extracting the required information is as smooth and accurate as possible.
