Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows might be missing crucial information, such as the state where the person works or their height.\n\n3. Duplicate Records: There may be duplicate rows with the same primeKey that need to be identified and handled correctly to avoid counting the same person more than once.\n\n4. Data Format Variation: The height could be stored in various formats that might require normalization (e.g., \"168cm,\" \"1.68m,\" \"66 inches\").\n\n5.
