When parsing datatables to answer questions about individuals who work in NY and are taller than 163 cm, several difficulties and obstacles could potentially arise:\n\n1. Data Format Consistency: The data may not be consistently formatted across records, which could make it difficult to accurately compare heights or determine job locations.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some records might have missing information regarding height or location of work, which would make it challenging to determine if they meet the criteria.\n\n3. Duplicates: There may be duplicate records for the same individual, and if not handled properly, this could lead to overcounting people.\n\n4. Unit Consistency: The units of measurement for height must be consistent throughout the datatable. If some records are in inches while others are in centimeters, conversions will be necessary.\n\n5. Data Spread Across Rows: Since the same primeKey indicates the same person, their information might be spread across multiple rows. It is essential to correctly link these rows to consolidate information about an individual.\n\n6. Error Handling: The datatable might contain errors or outliers that could affect the accuracy of the analysis, such as improbable heights or mistyped location codes.\n\n7. Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, it could be computationally intensive to process, potentially requiring optimization techniques for efficient querying.\n\n8. Complex Criteria: The question's criteria require a combination of two factors (location and height). Both factors must be checked for each individual, necessitating a multiple-condition filter.\n\n9. Data Privacy/Security: Depending on the sensitivity of the data, there might be privacy or security concerns that place restrictions on how it can be processed.\n\n10. Ambiguous Location Identifiers: The term \"NY\" might refer strictly to New York City or more broadly to anywhere in New York State, so it's important to understand the context.\n\nBefore we proceed with parsing the datatable, addressing and planning for these potential difficulties can help ensure a more accurate and efficient analysis."
