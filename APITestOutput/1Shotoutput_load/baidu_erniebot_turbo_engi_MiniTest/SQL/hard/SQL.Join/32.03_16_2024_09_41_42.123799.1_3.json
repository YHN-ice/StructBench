Here are some potential challenges:\n\n1. Inconsistent Data: The data might be inconsistent, with variations in how locations (WA) or heights are recorded. For example, WA could be referred to as Washington, W.A., or by a different name entirely in some entries.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some entries may not have complete information regarding the place of work or height, making it difficult to determine if the person meets the criteria.\n\n3. Data Format: Heights could be provided in different units (centimeters, meters, feet, inches, etc.) or formats, requiring conversion for accurate comparison.\n\n4. Duplicate Records: If the same person appears multiple times in the datatable with the same primeKey but with conflicting information, it needs to be resolved which record to consider.\n\n5. Ambiguity in Height Measurement: There may be ambiguity in whether 164 is included as \"taller than\" or if it strictly means taller than but not equal to 164.\n\n6. Errors in Data Entry: The datatable might contain errors due to incorrect data entry (e.g., typos, wrong categorization), which would lead to inaccurate results.\n\n7. Size of Data: If the datatable is very large, the process of filtering and sorting through the data to find the relevant records could be computationally intensive.\n\n8. Multiple Tables: The information might be spread across multiple tables, requiring a join or lookup to get all necessary information about individuals.\n\n9. Data Access and Processing Limitations: Depending on the data access methods and processing tools available, it might be more challenging to perform the necessary queries or computations.\n\n10. Unique Identification: Ensuring that the primeKey is indeed a unique identifier for individuals is crucial; otherwise, there could be confusion between records.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties would require careful examination of the data and possibly some preprocessing steps to standardize and clean the data before attempting to answer the question."
