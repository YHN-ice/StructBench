If the data is not consistently formatted in terms of case (i.e., 'A' vs 'a'), this could lead to missed matches.\n\n6. **Multiple Records with Same primeKey**: If there are multiple records with the same primeKey due to data duplication or representing different pieces of information, determining which one to report could be challenging.\n\n7. **Data Processing Errors**: Errors could arise during the data parsing process due to incorrect assumptions about data types, encoding issues, or software bugs.\n\nOnce we have the input file and understand its structure, we can approach these difficulties systematically to provide the correct answer."
