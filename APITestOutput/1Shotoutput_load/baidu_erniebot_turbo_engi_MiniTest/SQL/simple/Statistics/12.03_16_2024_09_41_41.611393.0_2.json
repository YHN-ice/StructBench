Inconsistent Data Entry: There could be inconsistencies in data entry, such as typos or different spellings for gender (e.g., \"Female\" vs. \"F\" vs. \"female\"), which may necessitate data cleaning or normalization before counting.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: The dataset might contain duplicate entries for the same person with different gender markers, leading to confusion about the actual gender.\n\n5. Complex Data Structure: If the data is structured in a complex way, with gender information spread across multiple tables or rows, careful parsing will be required to ensure accurate counting.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: The system might be case-sensitive, and gender identifiers could be in various cases (e.g., \"FEMALE\", \"Female\", \"female\"). This would require the parser to handle case-insensitive comparisons.\n\n7.
