However, as you mentioned, there are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process, such as nested commands, line breaks, custom commands, comments, and optional arguments.\n\nTo handle these issues, you can use a more sophisticated approach, such as using a parser or lexer to scan the LaTeX file line by line and identify bold text based on its structure and context. This approach can be more accurate and reliable than using regular expressions alone.\n\nIf you are familiar with LaTeX and its syntax, you can also manually identify bold texts by examining the document text line by line and identifying text enclosed within `\\textbf{}` commands.
