This can make parsing more complicated if we need to account for all possible inclusion commands.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: File paths in the include statements can be given in various formats, such as relative paths, absolute paths, or using variables for directory names. File names may also omit extensions, which the LaTeX compiler resolves based on the file types it supports.\n\n3. **Commented Out Lines**: Sometimes, lines including figures might be commented out using the `%` symbol. These lines should not be considered when extracting figure file names.\n\n4. **File Extension Omission**: Often LaTeX users will omit the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command because LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type. The parser should either infer the most common file types or ignore the extensions altogether.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: There could be lines where multiple figures are included within a single command, for example with subfigures.\n\n6. **Custom Commands or Environments**: If the document defines custom commands or environments to include figures, it can complicate the extraction process as these would not follow the standard LaTeX syntax for including graphics.\n\n7. **Complex File Names**: File names may contain spaces, special characters, or be constructed dynamically with LaTeX commands, complicating their extraction.\n\n8. **Option Clutter**: The `\\includegraphics` command can include several options for image scaling and rotation, etc., which could clutter the file name extraction if not properly parsed and separated from the actual file name.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a LaTeX file parser must be designed to accommodate a wide range of inclusion commands and syntax variations, handle comments appropriately, and deal with complex file names and paths while ignoring nonessential options."
