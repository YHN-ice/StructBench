Filenames within commented lines should not be considered as included figures.\n\n5. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command and similar commands allow for optional arguments (e.g., to set width, height, or rotation) which might appear before the actual filename making it necessary to correctly parse these to get to the filename.\n\n6. **Figure environments**: Figures might be included within different environments like `figure`, `minipage`, or custom-defined environments. Proper parsing of these environments is necessary to locate the figure filenames.\n\n7. **Custom commands**: The document could define custom commands that wrap standard figure inclusion commands, altering the expected patterns.\n\n8. **Text encoding and special characters**: Depending on the text encoding of the LaTeX file and the use of special characters in filenames, correctly interpreting these filenames can be an issue.\n\n9. **Commands spread over multiple lines**: LaTeX commands can be spread over multiple lines, which can make regex matching or line-by-line parsing challenging.\n\n10. **String concatenation**: File paths can sometimes be constructed using string concatenations or LaTeX commands (like `\\graphicspath`), complicating simple extraction.\n\nThese are just a few potential difficulties one might encounter, and the specific challenges would depend on the structure and complexity of the given LaTeX document."
