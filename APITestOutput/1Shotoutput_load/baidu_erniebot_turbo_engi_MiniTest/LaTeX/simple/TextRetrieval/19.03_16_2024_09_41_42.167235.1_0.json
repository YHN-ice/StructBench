Without access to these definitions, it could be hard to interpret them correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold commands might be nested within other formatting commands, such as italics or underlining. This nesting might make it difficult to extract only the bold text without also capturing the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Comments**: If there are comments in the LaTeX file (denoted by `%`), these could contain the string `\\textbf{...}`, but they should not be considered since they don't produce output in the final document.\n\n4. **Environment-Based Formatting**: Some environments might inherently produce bold text (like headings in certain document classes). If bold text is not explicitly marked with a bold command but is rather implied by the environment, it will be harder to detect.\n\n5. **Different Document Classes or Packages**: Depending on the document class or additional packages used, there could be alternative ways to achieve bold text that are non-standard or less common.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Instances where `\\textbf{}` is written as part of a code example and is escaped (e.g., `\\$textbf{}`) should not be considered as formatting commands.\n\nGiven these potential issues, a robust parsing strategy would involve checking for the most common commands while handling nested structures and ignoring comments and escaped characters, potentially with the aid of a LaTeX parser if available."
