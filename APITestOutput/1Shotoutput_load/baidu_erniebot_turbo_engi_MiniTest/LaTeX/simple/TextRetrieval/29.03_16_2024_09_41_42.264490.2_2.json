These lines should not be considered when extracting figure file names.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: LaTeX allows for including multiple figures in one command, such as within a `minipage` environment or using subfigure packages. This can complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **Custom Commands**: A LaTeX document might define custom commands that internally include a figure. Without the definition of these custom commands, it would be difficult to know which files are being included.\n\n8. **Multiple File Names**: In the case of image files, sometimes multiple file names are provided for the same image in different formats; we'll need to ensure that we extract all variants if present.\n\n9. **File Names Containing Special Characters**: LaTeX may include file names with special characters, which should be handled correctly during extraction.\n\n10. **Environment Parsing**: Figures might be embedded within different environments, such as `figure`, `center`, or user-defined ones, and the parser needs to understand the context to extract the file names properly.\n\nThese challenges mean that parsing a LaTeX file accurately requires careful consideration of the LaTeX syntax and the possible variations in which figures may be included."

        "Based on your input, the included figure files are:\n\n* `hj.png`\n* `oops.png`\n\nTo extract all included figure files from a LaTeX file, you can use a text parser such as Python's `re` module to search for specific patterns in the LaTeX code. In this case, you can search for any occurrence of `\\includegraphics[options]{filename}` where `filename` is the actual figure file name. You can use the following Python code to extract the file names:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open(\"input.tex\", \"r\") as file:\n    text = file.read()\n\n# Search for includegraphics commands with the correct format\nfig_pattern = r\"\\includegraphics\\[options\\]\\{(.*)\\}\"\nfig_names = re.findall(fig_pattern, text)\n\n# Print the file names separated by \\n\nfor name in fig_names:\n    print(name)\n```\nMake sure to replace \"input.tex\" with the actual LaTeX input file you're working with. This code will search for all occurrences of `\\includegraphics[options]{filename}` and extract the file names from the LaTeX code.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the LaTeX input is formatted correctly and follows the expected syntax for including figures.
