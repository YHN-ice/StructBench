This might complicate the extraction process if we need to maintain the document's structure or context.\n\n4. **Comments and non-printing characters**: The LaTeX file may contain comments (preceded by `%`) or non-printing characters that are not intended to be part of the final output, which need to be disregarded during extraction.\n\n5. **Custom macros or styles**: The document might define custom macros that handle text bolding, which would require awareness of those macros' definitions to properly extract bold texts.\n\n6. **Escape characters**: If any special LaTeX characters are used within the bold text, they may need to be handled or processed differently (e.g., `\\&` for an ampersand).\n\n7. **Environment-specific bolding**: Text might be made bold by being placed within a certain environment rather than by a direct command, so understanding the scope of environments is important.\n\n8. **Inconsistencies in formatting**: There might be inconsistencies in how bold text is formatted throughout the document (e.g., some using `\\textbf`, others using deprecated `\\bf`).\n\nGiven these potential challenges, it would be necessary to see the input file to determine the precise method for extracting bold texts and to apply any specialized handling required by the file's content and structure."
