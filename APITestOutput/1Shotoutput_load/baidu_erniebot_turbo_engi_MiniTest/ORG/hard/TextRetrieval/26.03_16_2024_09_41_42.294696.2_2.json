When trying to extract image file names from an ORG file, we might encounter the following challenges:\n\n1. **Format Variation**: Image links in ORG files can be included in various formats. We'll need to be familiar with all the possible formats in which images can be referenced.\n\n2. **Path Complexity**: Image paths could be absolute, relative, or even URLs. Parsing these correctly to extract just the file names might require some logic to handle different path structures.\n\n3. **Link Variations**: Images can be linked directly or may be embedded within other objects or descriptive text.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: We need to distinguish between different file types and ensure we're only extracting the ones for images (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif).\n\n5. **Markup Syntax**: ORG files use their own markup syntax that could include additional characters or formatting around the file names which we would need to strip out to get clean file names.\n\n6. **Handling Errors**: The ORG content might have broken links, incomplete file names or other errors that could make it difficult to parse correctly.\n\n7. **Embedded Images**: Sometimes images are not referenced as files but are included as base64 encoded strings directly in the file. These would not have traditional file names but could still represent image data.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help us to parse the ORG file more accurately and provide the correct answer.
