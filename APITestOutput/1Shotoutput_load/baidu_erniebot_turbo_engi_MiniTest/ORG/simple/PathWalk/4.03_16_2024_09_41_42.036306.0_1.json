Hierarchical Structure - ORG files are typically structured hierarchically with sections and subsections denoted by asterisks (*). Ensuring that we correctly identify the 1st subsection under the 1st section requires understanding this structure.\n\n2. Text Formatting - ORG files can contain various text formatting elements such as bold, italic, links, or code blocks. The parser needs to handle these correctly when returning the raw text as it appears.\n\n3. Metadata - ORG files can contain metadata like TODO status, tags, and properties. The parser should decide whether this metadata is considered part of the content and how to represent it in the output.\n\n4. Nested Content - Subsections can have their own nested content or sub-subsections. The parser must correctly identify the end of the 1st subsection without including content from deeper levels.\n\n5. Incomplete Structures - If the ORG file is not well-formed (e.g., missing asterisks or inconsistent indentation), it may be challenging to accurately determine the structure and extract the correct content.\n\n6. Large Files - If the ORG file is exceptionally large, performance considerations may come into play when parsing and traversing the content.\n\n7. Special Blocks - ORG files can include special blocks such as quotes or source code blocks. Parsing these might require special handling to ensure that they are displayed correctly.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties and establishing a strategy to address them, I can proceed with parsing the ORG file once it is provided."
