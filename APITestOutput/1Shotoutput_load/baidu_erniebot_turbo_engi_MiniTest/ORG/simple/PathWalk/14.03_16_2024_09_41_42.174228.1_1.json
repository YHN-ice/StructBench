Identifying the correct section especially when there are similarly named sections could be challenging.\n\n4. **Large File Size:** If the ORG file is very large, it might be difficult to process it efficiently to extract the relevant section.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Malformed Data:** If the ORG file is incomplete or has malformed sections, it might not be possible to parse the content accurately.\n\n6. **Embedded Content:** ORG files can contain embedded content such as code blocks, tables, or even links to external resources. Parsing and presenting this content correctly might require additional processing.\n\n7. **Access to File Content:** In order to parse the file, I need to have access to the content of the ORG file.
