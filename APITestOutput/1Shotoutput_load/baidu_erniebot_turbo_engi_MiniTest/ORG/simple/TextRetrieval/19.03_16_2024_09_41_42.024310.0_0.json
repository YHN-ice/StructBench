Typically, this is done using asterisks or plus signs (e.g., `*bold*` or `+bold+`). Parsing errors could occur if the syntax is not consistently used or recognized.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting (like italic, underlined, or code blocks), which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text may span multiple lines in the ORG file, and ensuring that multiline bold text is extracted correctly can be challenging.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Users might have escaped the bold syntax to display the asterisks or plus signs literally, rather than to indicate bold formatting.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users may unintentionally use incorrect or inconsistent formatting which doesn't follow the standard ORG mode conventions for bold text, leading to missed extractions.\n\n6. **File Structure and Metadata**: ORG files may contain structural elements like headlines, lists, and links, as well as metadata (tags, properties), which need to be parsed correctly to avoid including non-bold text in the extraction.\n\n7. **Mixed Content**: Bold text might be mixed with other textual elements, such as hyperlinks or footnotes, which could make extraction non-trivial.\n\nTo provide a correct answer, my parsing logic would need to accurately identify and handle the above scenarios.
