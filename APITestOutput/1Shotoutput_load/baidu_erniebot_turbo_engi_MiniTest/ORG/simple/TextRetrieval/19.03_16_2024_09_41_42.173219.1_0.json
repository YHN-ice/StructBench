However, asterisks could also be used for other formatting or be present in the text for other reasons, so the parser must correctly identify only those asterisks that indicate bold formatting without false positives.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underlined, or code blocks. The parser must handle these nested formats correctly and still identify the bold text.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: If a user wants to include literal asterisks in their text, they might use escape characters. The parser must differentiate between escaped asterisks and those used for bold formatting.\n\n4. **Multiple Bold Segments**: An ORG file might contain multiple bold segments. The parser must be able to identify and extract all of them, not just the first one it encounters.\n\n5. **Line Breaks within Bold Text**: There might be line breaks within bold text segments. The parser should correctly handle these and include the full text that is meant to be bold.\n\n6. **Variations in ORG Mode Versions**: Different versions of ORG mode might have slight variations in how bold text is marked up. The parser would ideally be able to handle these variations.\n\nTo extract all bold texts accurately, the parser needs to systematically scan the ORG file content, correctly interpret the markup according to ORG mode's syntax rules, and cleanly separate the extracted bold texts with newlines as requested."

        "Extracting bold texts from the input ORG file involves parsing the file content and identifying bold text based on the ORG mode syntax rules. Here's an example Python script that can be used to extract bold texts from the input ORG file and print the raw texts separated by \\n:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Read the input ORG file\nwith open(\"input.org\", \"r\") as file:\n    content = file.read()\n\n# Extract bold texts using regular expression\nbold_texts = re.findall(r\"[*]{3}(.*?)[*]{3}\", content)\n\n# Print the raw texts separated by \\n\nfor text in bold_texts:\n    print(text.strip())\n```\nThis script uses a regular expression to match bold text based on the pattern `[*]{3}(.*?)[*]{3}` where `[*]{3}` matches three consecutive asterisks and `(.*?)` captures the bold text between the asterisks. The script then iterates over the extracted bold texts and prints each raw text separated by a newline character.\n\nNote that this script assumes that the input ORG file follows the expected formatting rules for bold text in ORG mode. If the input file contains variations or other formatting elements that are not handled by the regular expression, the script may not accurately extract all bold texts."
