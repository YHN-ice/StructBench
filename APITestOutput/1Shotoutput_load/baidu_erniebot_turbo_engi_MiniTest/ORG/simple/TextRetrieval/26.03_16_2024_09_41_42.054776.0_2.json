The parser must handle different syntaxes used for embedding images such as links or specific markup.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Images can be included using either relative or absolute paths. The parser must correctly interpret these paths to extract the file names.\n\n3. **File Extensions:** Not all image files will have standard `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif` extensions. Some may use less common image formats or have no extension at all. The parser should be robust enough to handle these cases.\n\n4. **Inline Images vs. Links:** Images can be directly displayed inline or linked so that they are not displayed but are just referred to. The parser must differentiate between these types.\n\n5. **Comments and Non-Image Links:** ORG files may contain comments or links to non-image files. The parser should ignore irrelevant links and comments.\n\n6. **Embedded Base64 Images:** Sometimes images are embedded directly in the file as Base64 encoded strings rather than links to files. These would need a different handling strategy.\n\n7. **Multi-line Links:** If an image link is broken up across multiple lines, the parser needs to be able to recognize and reconstruct it.\n\n8. **Malformed Links:** Improperly formatted links might exist, and the parser might need rules to either correct them or ignore them based on the requirement.\n\n9. **Multiple Images on One Line:** There could be multiple image links on a single line, and the parser should be able to handle this without confusion.\n\n10. **Textual References:** There could be textual mentions of image files that aren't actual links or embeds, which should not be confused with actual image references.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges can help in developing a parser that accurately extracts the required information from an ORG file."
