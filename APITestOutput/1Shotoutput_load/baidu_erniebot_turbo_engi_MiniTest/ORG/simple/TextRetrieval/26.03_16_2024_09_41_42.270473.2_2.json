        "Based on the provided input, the ORG file contains image files in different formats and locations. The parser should be able to identify these images based on their format and location. Here's a potential approach for extracting image file names from the ORG file:\n\n1. Identify possible image file formats: Determine the different image file formats used in the ORG file, such as .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.\n2. Parse the ORG file: Use a parser to parse the ORG file and extract image file names based on the identified image formats and locations.\n3. Filter out non-image files: Remove any non-image files from the output using appropriate criteria, such as file extension or textual content.\n4. Extract image file names: Separate the image file names using a newline character (\\n) to ensure they are printed one per line.\n\nTo address potential difficulties and obstacles mentioned in the post, it's recommended to consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Identify multiple image formats: Ensure the parser can handle multiple image formats by testing different formats and patterns in the ORG file.\n2. Account for reference styles: Account for absolute or relative paths and various protocols used to reference images in the ORG file.\n3. Recognize file extensions: Ensure the parser can recognize relevant image file extensions by testing different file extensions in the ORG file.\n4. Differentiate between embedded images and links: Differentiate between actual image file links and other embedded objects or links using appropriate criteria, such as location or textual content.\n5. Handle syntax variations: Ensure the parser can handle different syntaxes used to include images in the ORG file, such as using brackets or not.\n6. Filter out textual noise: Remove any non-image related text that includes strings that resemble image filenames but aren't relevant using appropriate criteria, such as location or textual content.\n\nBased on the provided input, it appears that an appropriate parser would be able to extract all included image files and print their names separated by \\n. However, it's important to carefully test and validate the parser to ensure it meets your requirements and addresses any potential obstacles and difficulties."
