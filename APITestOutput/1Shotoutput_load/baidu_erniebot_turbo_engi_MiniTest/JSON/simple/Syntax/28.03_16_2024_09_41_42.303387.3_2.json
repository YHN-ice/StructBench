A common error is forgetting a comma or adding an extra one where it's not needed.\n\n2. Incorrect use of quotes: In JSON, keys and string values must be wrapped in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and keys without any quotes will cause an error.\n\n3. Braces and brackets mismatch: Every opening curly brace `{` and opening square bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing brace `}` or bracket `]`. Mismatches can lead to parsing errors.\n\n4. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Placing the wrong type (like an unquoted string where a number is expected) can result in errors.\n\n5. Trailing commas: While some programming languages and parsers tolerate trailing commas in lists and objects, standard JSON does not allow them.\n\n6.
