Object members must consist of key-value pairs, with keys being strings and values being valid JSON data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null).\n4. All keys (names) in an object should be within double quotes `\" \"`.\n5. Values in key-value pairs are separated by a colon `:`.\n6.
