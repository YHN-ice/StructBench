        "To access the value \"o\" in the JSON object, you can follow the same approach as you did for accessing \"X\" in the previous example. You can use the same nested key-path to traverse through the JSON structure and access the desired value.\n\nHere's an example of how you can access the value \"o\":\n\n\n```python\nobj = {\n    \"id\": \"m\",\n    \"Z\": \"o\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"n\",\n            \"Y\": \"n\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"o\",\n                    \"X\": \"m\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nanswer = obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"id\"]  # Accessing \"o\" value\nprint(answer)\n```\nIn this example, you can follow the same nested key-path to access the value \"o\". You start with `obj[\"subs\"]` to access the first level of nested objects, then access the second level with `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"]` and so on. Finally, you can access the desired value by traversing through the keys until you reach the desired object.\n\nPlease note that this approach assumes that the JSON structure is consistent and follows the provided key-path. If there are any changes or additional nested structures, it might be necessary to adjust the key-path accordingly. Additionally, it's always a good practice to validate the JSON structure and syntax before accessing values to avoid any parsing errors."
