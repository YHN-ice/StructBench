It's crucial to ensure you're accessing the right key at the right nesting level.\n\n3. **Array Indexing**: JSON arrays are zero-indexed. When accessing elements, it's important to use the correct index, or you might retrieve the wrong item.\n\n4. **Dynamic Structure**: If the structure of the JSON is dynamic and changes frequently, it can be challenging to write a consistent path to a value.\n\n5. **Type Errors**: JSON supports different data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring that you're handling the types correctly is important to avoid errors.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it can be cumbersome to parse and navigate through it to access a specific value.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: A missing comma, brace, or bracket can lead to parsing errors which can halt the process of reading a JSON file.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: JSON files are typically encoded in UTF-8. Any deviation from this encoding can lead to issues while parsing.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one must be meticulous in understanding the structure of the JSON file, use correct keys and indices, handle different data types properly, and pay attention to the syntax and encoding standards.

        "I understand your question and the potential difficulties encountered while accessing values in a deeply nested JSON structure. Based on your input JSON, here's an example code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to access the value \"j\" using a nested dictionary approach:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Input JSON\njson_str = '''\n{\n  \"id\": \"v\",\n  \"Z\": \"j\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"w\",\n      \"Y\": \"i\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"x\",\n          \"X\": \"h\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n'''\n\n# Parse JSON string to dictionary\njson_obj = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Access value \"j\" using nested dictionary approach\nvalue_j = json_obj[\"Z\"]\nprint(value_j)\n```\nOutput:\n\n\n```arduino\nj\n```\nIn this example, I'm using the `json.loads()` function to parse the JSON string to a dictionary object. Then, I can access the value \"j\" by traversing the nested dictionary structure using the desired key path (e.g., `\"Z\"`). Note that it's crucial to follow the correct keys and indices to avoid accessing the wrong value.\n\nThis approach ensures that you can easily navigate through deeply nested JSON structures to access specific values without encountering any potential difficulties or obstacles.
