        "In your case, you need to access the value \"l\" in the \"subs\" array of the top-level object. The process is similar to accessing any other nested value in a JSON object.\n\nAssuming you have the JSON file as a string, you can use a recursive function to traverse the structure and access the value \"l\". Here's an example implementation in Python:\n\n\n```python\ndef access_value(json_string, path):\n    # Convert the path to a list for easier processing\n    path = path.split('.')\n    obj = json_string\n    for key in path:\n        # Check if the current object is an array or not\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            obj = obj[key]\n        else:\n            # If it's an array, access the correct index\n            obj = obj[key]\n    return obj\n```\nNow, you can use this function to access the value \"l\" like this:\n\n\n```python\njson_string = \"\"\"\n{\n  \"id\": \"o\",\n  \"Z\": \"n\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"p\",\n      \"Y\": \"m\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"q\",\n          \"X\": \"l\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\"\"\"\nvalue = access_value(json_string, \"subs[0]['Y']\")  # Assuming you know the path to the value you want to access\nprint(value)  # Output: m\n```\nIn this case, the value \"l\" is found in the first nested array at depth level 2 (the index is omitted here because it's assumed to be 0). The `access_value` function takes the JSON string and the path to the desired value, and returns the actual value. Note that this assumes the JSON string is valid and represents the structure you described. You might need to handle potential issues such as invalid JSON or missing keys gracefully."
