Large files may require streaming or chunking methods to process without running out of memory.\n\n2. **Deeply Nested Structures**: JSON can contain highly nested structures that make it hard to navigate and identify the deepest levels.\n\n3. **Variability in Structure**: Different sections of a JSON file might have different structures, which complicates the process of determining the nesting level universally across the file.\n\n4. **Mixed Data Types**: JSON objects can contain mixed data types (strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, arrays, and objects). When traversing, we need to handle arrays and objects differently since they can contain more nested data.\n\n5. **Recursion Complexity**: To find the most deeply nested objects, a recursive approach is often used. However, recursion can be complex to implement correctly and can lead to issues such as stack overflows if not managed correctly.\n\n6. **Circular References**: In some cases, JSON might contain circular references (an object referencing itself directly or indirectly), which can cause infinite loops if not handled properly.\n\n7. **Identifying Objects without List or Dict Values**: We need to write logic that specifically identifies objects that do not contain any list or dict as values since these are considered to be the most deeply nested objects according to your criteria.\n\n8. **Multiple Most Deeply Nested Objects**: There may be multiple objects at the same maximum depth. The algorithm needs to correctly identify and return all such objects.\n\n9. **Output Format**: The requirement to separate excerpts by `\\n\\n` means that we need to ensure proper formatting in the output, which adds an additional layer of string manipulation.\n\n10. **Performance**: If the file is very complex, iterating through all elements to check their depth and content could be time-consuming and we might need to optimize for performance.\n\nOnce presented with the JSON file, I will parse it to find the most deeply nested objects that do not contain any list or dict as values and provide their excerpts separated by newlines as requested."
