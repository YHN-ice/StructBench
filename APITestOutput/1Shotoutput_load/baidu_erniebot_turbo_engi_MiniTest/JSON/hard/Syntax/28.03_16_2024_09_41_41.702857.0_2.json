Errors can occur if the wrong data type is used for a given value.\n\n3. **Nesting and Hierarchy**: Incorrectly nested objects or arrays could lead to structural issues.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: If the file has characters that are not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), it may not be parsed correctly.\n\n5. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is exceptionally large, it could potentially cause memory issues or long processing times which might hinder the parsing process.\n\n6. **Key Duplicates**: JSON objects should not have duplicate keys, but if they do, it might lead to ambiguity or overwriting of values during the parsing process.\n\n7. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, so their presence would be considered an error.\n\n8. **External References**: JSON doesn't support references to external files or resources.
