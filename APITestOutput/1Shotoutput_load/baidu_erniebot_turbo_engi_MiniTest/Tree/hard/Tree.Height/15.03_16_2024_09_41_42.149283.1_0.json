        "The height of the root node is 7.\n\nTo calculate the height of the root node, we need to follow the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. In this case, the longest path is from the root node (p) to the leaf node (z).\n\nThe path from p to z includes the following nodes: p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. There are 9 nodes on this path, so the height of the root node is 9 - 1 = 8.
