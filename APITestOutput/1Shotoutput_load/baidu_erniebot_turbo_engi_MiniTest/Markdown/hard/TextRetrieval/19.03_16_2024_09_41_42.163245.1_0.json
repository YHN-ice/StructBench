The parser must be able to recognize all variations.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can include other Markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, code spans `` `code` ``, or even other bold or italic markers. Ensuring that only the bold text is extracted without unwanted nested elements can be tricky.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows characters like asterisks and underscores to be escaped with a backslash to be treated as literal characters rather than formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should not mistakenly extract these as bold text.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes users may forget to close the formatting markers properly, which could lead to confusion as to what text is actually meant to be bold.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Characters that appear to be bold markers but are actually part of a different context (e.g., within a code block where they should not be treated as formatting) should be ignored.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Some Markdown variations allow for bold text to span multiple lines. The parser must correctly handle such cases if they are supported by the Markdown variant in use.\n\n7. **Adjacent Bold Sections**: If there are bold texts immediately next to each other without spacing, the parser needs to distinguish them as separate instances.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is large with lots of bold text, the parser's efficiency may come into question, and it must perform well without consuming excessive resources.\n\nEach of these issues requires careful consideration to ensure that the parser correctly identifies and extracts all bold text from the Markdown input provided."
