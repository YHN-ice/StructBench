For instance, headers can be indicated with `#`, `##`, etc., or with underlines made of `=` or `-` for level 1 and 2 headers, respectively.\n\n2. **Nested Structures**: Markdown allows for nested structures such as lists within lists or blockquotes within lists. Parsing these correctly to maintain the hierarchy is essential.\n\n3. **Link and Image References**: Links and images can be included inline or as reference-style, with the actual URL stored elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Code blocks and inline code have their own formatting rules and are separate from the regular text content. They must be handled differently, particularly if they contain characters that might otherwise be interpreted as Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **HTML Blocks**: Markdown supports inline HTML, which might complicate parsing since HTML tags will need to be treated differently from Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Tables**: Markdown tables have a specific syntax that needs to be recognized and parsed correctly.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of the Markdown syntax could be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted, which affects how the text should be parsed.\n\n8. **Identifying Sections and Subsections**: Identifying which part of the text corresponds to the \"1st subsection under 1st section\" requires an understanding of the hierarchical structure based on headings.\n\nOnce I have access to the input Markdown file, these are some of the challenges I would need to consider in order to parse it correctly and provide an accurate excerpt."
