Typically, bold text is denoted by `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`.\n\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text may have other formatting nested within it, such as italic (`*italic*` or `_italic_`), code (`code`), or even hyperlinks (`[title](URL)`). You'll need to extract just the bold text without any nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escape characters:** The Markdown syntax may include escape characters that are meant to be displayed rather than interpreted, like `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be treated as bold.\n\n4. **In-line versus block formatting:** Bold text may appear inline within a paragraph or as part of a larger block element, like a list or header. The parser needs to recognize bold text within these different contexts.\n\n5. **Partial formatting errors:** Sometimes, Markdown files may contain errors where the bold formatting is not properly closed, such as `**bold text`.
