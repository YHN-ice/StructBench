The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. However, images might be included without alt text, titles, or using reference-style links.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files may include images using HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax (e.g., `<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"description\" />`). Detecting these requires parsing HTML within the Markdown.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute paths**: Image sources can be either relative to the document or absolute URLs. It is necessary to identify which type of path is used to correctly list the file names.\n\n4. **Encoded and special characters**: File names in the URLs can contain URL encoded characters or special characters that need to be decoded or processed to get the actual file name.\n\n5. **Link references elsewhere in the document**: Markdown allows for defining link references that can be used multiple times in the document. These references may be defined at the bottom of the document or inline.\n\n6. **Non-image links**: It is important not to confuse image syntax with link syntax, as they are very similar in Markdown.\n\n7. **Comments and escaped characters**: Comments or escaping characters in Markdown might hide image syntax or alter how it is parsed.\n\n8. **File names with spaces**: Spaces in file names might be represented differently, such as with `%20` for URL encoding, and would need to be handled.\n\nTo accurately answer this question, I will need to parse the provided Markdown file, identify all the image syntaxes, handle any of the above difficulties if they are present, and list the file names of the images included in the document."
