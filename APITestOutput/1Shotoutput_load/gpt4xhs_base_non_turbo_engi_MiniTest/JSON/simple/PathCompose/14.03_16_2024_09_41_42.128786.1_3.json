The type of data being accessed may not be as expected, leading to issues when attempting to use the value.\n\n6. **Complexity of JSON File**: Depending on the complexity and size of the JSON file, it might be difficult to manually trace the key path without making errors.\n\n7. **Dynamic Keys**: Sometimes JSON objects might have keys that are dynamically generated and not known beforehand, making it challenging to write a predetermined path to access a value.\n\n8. **Encoding and Escaping**: Special characters in keys or strings may need proper encoding or escaping to be correctly interpreted by the parser.\n\n9. **Updates to the JSON Structure**: If the structure of the JSON file changes (e.g., due to an update in the API or file format), then the hard-coded path to a value might become invalid.\n\nFor a parser or a person navigating a JSON file, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of its structure and to handle potential errors gracefully.
