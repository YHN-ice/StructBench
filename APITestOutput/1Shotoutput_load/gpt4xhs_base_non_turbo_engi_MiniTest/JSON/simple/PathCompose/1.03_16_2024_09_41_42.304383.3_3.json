Ensuring that the correct type is being accessed (e.g., not trying to index into a number) is important.\n\n5. **Index Out of Bound**: When accessing arrays, an index that is out of bounds can lead to errors.\n\n6. **Dynamic Structure**: If the structure of the JSON file is dynamic or not well-known in advance, it may be difficult to programmatically access a value without conditional checks.\n\nTo avoid these issues, it's essential to carefully analyze the JSON structure, ensure you are using the correct key names and indices, handle different data types appropriately, and write code that can handle unexpected or dynamic structures gracefully.
