Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of correctly identifying errors:\n\n1. **Missing or Extra Commas:** In JSON, objects and arrays use commas to separate elements. Missing or extra commas can lead to parsing errors.\n\n2. **Mismatched Brackets and Braces:** JSON uses square brackets for arrays and curly braces for objects. Mismatched or improperly nested brackets and braces can corrupt the structure.\n\n3. **Improper Quotes:** JSON requires double quotes for strings and property names. Single quotes, absence of quotes, or incorrect use of quotes can cause errors.\n\n4. **Data Types Issues:** JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). Assigning an incorrect data type to a value can result in a structural error.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas:** While some JSON parsers are lenient with trailing commas after the last element in an object or array, the JSON standard does not allow them.\n\n6. **Encoding Problems:** Non-standard characters or encoding issues can cause problems during parsing.\n\n7. **Invalid JSON Keywords:** Using invalid keywords or values (e.g., undefined) that are not part of the JSON specification can lead to errors.\n\n8. **Unescaped Special Characters:** Special characters in strings need to be properly escaped with a backslash (\\).\n\n9. **Key Duplication:** Duplicate keys within an object may lead to undefined behavior depending on the parser's implementation.\n\nTo accurately determine if the JSON file is free from structural errors, the JSON content must be carefully examined while considering these potential issues."
