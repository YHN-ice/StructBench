However, since I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and not a JSON file parser program, I cannot execute code or directly interact with files. Instead, I can provide guidance on how you might approach this task in a programmatic way. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when identifying the most deeply nested objects in a JSON file:\n\n1. **Identifying Deeply Nested Objects**: We need a systematic way to traverse the JSON structure to identify which objects are the most deeply nested. This usually involves recursive traversal or using a stack/queue to manage the traversal process.\n\n2. **Defining \"Most Deeply Nested\"**: The definition of \"most deeply nested\" must be clear. Are we considering depth based on the number of levels, or is there another criteria? It's also important to consider what qualifies as an object (typically any `{}` in JSON).\n\n3. **Handling Multiple Types**: JSON structures can contain various types (objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null). The logic must handle these types appropriately and understand when an object is not further nestable.\n\n4. **Extracting Exact Excerpts**: To provide an excerpt as it appears in the JSON file, we must retain the original formatting and structure. This means keeping track of the object's original text representation during traversal.\n\n5. **Output Formatting**: The result should be well-formatted and human-readable, which may require additional processing to present the data clearly.\n\n6. **Performance Concerns**: For very large JSON files, performance might be a concern and the algorithm needs to be efficient.\n\n7. **Multiple Occurrences**: If there are multiple objects that are equally deeply nested, the code must handle all such cases.\n\nWithout the actual JSON file, I can only speculate on these challenges. Once you provide the file or its content, I can assist with constructing a pseudo-algorithm or logic that would help in solving the problem."
