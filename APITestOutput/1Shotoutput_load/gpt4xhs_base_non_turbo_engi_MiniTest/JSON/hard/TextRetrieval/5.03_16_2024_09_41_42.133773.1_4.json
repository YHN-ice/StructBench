Distinguishing between these and ensuring that nested elements are not lists or dictionaries can be tricky.\n\n3. **Key Overlaps**: Identical keys at different levels of nesting could lead to confusion if the path to each key is not carefully tracked.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be difficult to process it efficiently without running into memory or performance issues.\n\n5. **Encoding and Format Issues**: JSON files must be properly encoded (typically UTF-8). If there are encoding issues or if the file isn't properly formatted as JSON, parsing it could lead to errors.\n\n6. **Recursive Parsing Logic**: Implementing the logic to recursively parse the JSON file and keep track of the depth might be complex, especially when considering edge cases.\n\n7. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring that the output excerpts appear exactly as they do in the JSON file while preserving their order and indentation could be another challenge.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful planning of the parsing algorithm, proper exception handling, and testing with various JSON structures will be essential.
