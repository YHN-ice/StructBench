Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise during the process:\n\n1. **Syntax Errors**: JSON syntax is fairly strict. The following are common syntax issues:\n   - Missing or extra commas between elements in arrays or objects.\n   - Unquoted keys in objects.\n   - Single quotes used instead of double quotes for strings.\n   - Trailing commas after the last element in objects or arrays.\n   - Use of comments which are not officially supported in JSON.\n\n2. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types, and a mismatch (e.g., a string value when a number is expected) could be considered a structural error depending on the context.\n\n3. **Mismatched Braces and Brackets**: Every opening brace `{` must have a corresponding closing brace `}`, and every opening bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing bracket `]`.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: JSON should be encoded in UTF-8, and any deviation might cause errors during parsing.\n\n5. **Nested Structures**: Deeply nested or complex JSON structures can sometimes lead to confusion about the correct level of nesting or structure.\n\n6. **File Size**: Extremely large JSON files can pose challenges for parsers that have memory limitations or performance constraints.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Special characters like newlines, tabs, quotes, etc., need to be properly escaped with a backslash `\\`.\n\n8. **Data Integrity**: While not a syntactic issue, data within the JSON file could be incorrect or corrupt, which could be mistaken for structural errors if not properly validated.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the given JSON file, they would need to be corrected for it to be parsed successfully."
