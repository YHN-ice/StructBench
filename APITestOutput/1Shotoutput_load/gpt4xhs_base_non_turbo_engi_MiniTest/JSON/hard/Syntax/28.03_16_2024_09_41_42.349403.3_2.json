If there are commas after the last value in an object or array, it's an error.\n\n5. **Encoding Problems**: JSON should be encoded in UTF-8, and any deviation might cause issues.\n\n6. **Duplicate Keys**: JSON objects should not have duplicate keys, as this can cause unpredictable behavior when parsed.\n\n7. **Size Limitations**: If the JSON file is too large, it might exceed the system's capacity to process it effectively, leading to potential errors.\n\nWithout seeing the input file, these are some of the common issues that could potentially be present and would need to be checked to ensure a JSON file is free from structural errors."
