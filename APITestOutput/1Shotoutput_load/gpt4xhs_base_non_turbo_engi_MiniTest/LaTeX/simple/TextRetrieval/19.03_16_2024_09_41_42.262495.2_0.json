Different commands for bold text: LaTeX can use multiple commands to make text bold, such as `\\textbf{}` or `\\bfseries`. Some users may even define custom commands for bold text. The parser must recognize all these possibilities.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands, or it may itself contain other formatting like italics, underlines, or colors. The parser needs to handle nested commands correctly to extract only the bold text.\n\n3. Environment usage: Bold text might be inside different environments, such as `itemize`, `enumerate`, or custom environments. These should be handled properly to extract the bold text.\n\n4. Text broken across lines: Sometimes, the text that is meant to be bold might be broken across lines or paragraphs. The parser should concatenate this text properly.\n\n5. Comments and ignored text: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. Text within comments should not be extracted, as it's not rendered in the final document.\n\n6. Special characters and LaTeX commands: Bold text may include special characters that need to be interpreted or escaped (like `&`, `%`, `{`, `}`, and so on) and LaTeX commands that should be either interpreted or stripped out in the output.\n\n7. Multiple bold sections in a single command: There might be multiple bold text segments within a single `\\textbf{}` command, separated by other commands or plain text.\n\nAddressing these issues would require the parser to have a robust understanding of LaTeX syntax and the ability to differentiate between different formatting contexts."
