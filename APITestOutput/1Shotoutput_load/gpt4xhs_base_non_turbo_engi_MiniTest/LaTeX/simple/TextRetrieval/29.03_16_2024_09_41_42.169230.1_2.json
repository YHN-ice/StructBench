Each command might have different syntaxes that need to be correctly identified.\n\n2. **File Paths**: The file names for the figures could have relative or absolute paths. The parser must handle both types and extract just the file names if required.\n\n3. **Options in Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have options like scale, width, height, etc., that precede the file path, which means the parser cannot simply look for the first set of curly braces to find the file name.\n\n4. **Commented Code**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` character. If a figure inclusion command is commented out, it should not be counted.\n\n5. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX files may include the file extension in the figure file name, while others may leave it out, relying on LaTeX to find the correct file type. The parser should be capable of recognizing both scenarios.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, LaTeX users include subfigures within a figure environment, possibly with multiple `\\includegraphics` commands in a single environment.\n\n7. **File Name with Spaces**: Rarely, but possibly, there might be file names with spaces enclosed in double braces `{{...}}` or quotes `\"...\"`.\n\n8. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments for including figures which would require parsing these new definitions as well.\n\nTo handle these difficulties, a robust LaTeX parser will need to correctly recognize figure inclusion commands while ignoring comments and options, extract file names with or without extensions, and manage both relative and absolute paths.
