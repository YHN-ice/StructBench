Identifying all the possible ways bolding can occur is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands such as italic (`\\textit{}`), underline (`\\underline{}`), etc. Properly parsing nested commands to extract only the bold text could be challenging.\n\n3. **Braces Handling**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to define the scope of commands. It's important to correctly handle these braces to accurately extract the desired text.\n\n4. **Custom Environments**: If the document defines custom commands or environments that result in bold text, recognizing these would be necessary to extract all bold texts.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Text that appears to be bold within comments (`%`) or inactive code blocks should not be extracted as they are not part of the compiled document.\n\n6. **Text Spread Across Lines**: Sometimes the bold text might be spread across multiple lines or include line breaks. This must be taken into account to ensure the integrity of the extracted text.\n\n7. **Multiple Bold Segments in One Command**: A single `\\textbf{}` command might contain multiple segments of text intended to be bold, separated by other commands or plain text.\n\n8. **Environment-Based Formatting**: Some environments, like `theorem` or `section`, might inherently format text in bold. Recognizing these environments is important to extract text correctly.\n\nIt's important that I see the input file to identify which of these challenges are present and need to be addressed to extract the bold texts accurately."
