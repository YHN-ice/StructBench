These would be harder to detect without knowing the definitions.\n\n4. **Parameterized commands:** Some bold commands might take parameters that affect how the text is processed, which could impact the extraction logic.\n\n5. **Comments and inactive code:** Comments in LaTeX (using `%`) or conditional code might contain bold text commands that are not actually used in the final document, which should probably be ignored.\n\n6. **Different document classes and packages:** The behavior of certain commands might change depending on the document class or packages used, which could influence how bold text is to be identified.\n\n7. **Escape characters and special cases:** LaTeX syntax includes various escape characters and special cases that might be part of the bold text, complicating its extraction.\n\n8. **Line breaks and whitespace management:** LaTeX is tolerant of whitespace and line breaks, so the bold command and the enclosed text might not be on the same line, creating challenges for a simple parsing approach.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, the parser must be able to handle all these cases correctly.
