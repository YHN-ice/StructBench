Correctly identifying the commands for sections (`\\section`) and subsections (`\\subsection`) is crucial.\n\n2. **Correct Sectioning**: LaTeX documents can have multiple sections and subsections. It is necessary to navigate to the correct section and subsection as specified (first section, first subsection).\n\n3. **LaTeX Commands**: The content within the subsection may include various LaTeX commands that affect formatting (such as `\\textbf`, `\\textit`, etc.). Depending on your requirements, these may need to be interpreted or left as-is.\n\n4. **Environment Content**: If the subsection includes different environments like figures, tables, or equations, it could complicate extracting the plain text content.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX files may contain comments (denoted by `%`) that should not be included in the output content unless specifically requested.\n\n6. **Nested Content**: Subsections can contain nested content, such as subsubsections or paragraphs. Clear rules should be established about how to handle such content.\n\n7. **Incomplete Code**: The snippet of the LaTeX file provided may be incomplete or missing context, making it difficult to parse correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser needs to be able to interpret LaTeX structure commands accurately and maintain state about the current position within the document hierarchy. It should also handle text content with consideration of LaTeX formatting commands and environments.
