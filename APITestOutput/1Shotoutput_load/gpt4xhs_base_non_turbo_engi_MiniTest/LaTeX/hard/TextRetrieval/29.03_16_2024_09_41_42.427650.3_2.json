Use of variables for file names: LaTeX allows the use of commands and variables to specify file names, which may require additional parsing to resolve the actual file name.\n\n4. Commented code: Parts of the LaTeX code might be commented out using the `%` symbol. Such lines should be ignored when extracting figure file names.\n\n5.
