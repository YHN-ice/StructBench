I need to handle all possible ways of denoting bold text.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting commands or environments. For example, `\\textbf{\\emph{...}}` would result in bold and italicized text. Extracting just the bold portion requires parsing the nested structures correctly.\n\n3. **Braces matching**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to group content, but not every brace necessarily indicates the start or end of bold text. I'll need to ensure that braces are properly matched and that only those associated with bold commands are considered.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Characters that might denote LaTeX commands could be escaped (e.g., `\\textbackslash textbf\\{...\\}`), which means they should not be treated as commands. I need to differentiate between escaped characters and actual commands.\n\n5. **Comments**: Text within comments (e.g., `% this is a comment`) should not be considered part of the output, even if they contain what looks like formatting commands.\n\n6. **Custom commands**: The document might define custom macros or commands that result in bold text, which won't be recognized without analyzing the command definitions.\n\n7. **Incomplete or malformed commands**: In case of an error in the LaTeX source, such as an incomplete command or missing braces, it might be difficult to accurately extract the intended text.\n\nKeeping these potential difficulties in mind, I am ready to see the input file and attempt to extract the bold texts according to the instructions."
