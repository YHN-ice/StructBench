For example, if there is `<book>` there should be a corresponding `</book>`.\n\n2. **Improper Nesting**: Tags must be properly nested; for example, `<outer><inner></outer></inner>` is incorrect because the `inner` element is not properly closed before closing the `outer` element.\n\n3. **Missing Quotes in Attributes**: Attribute values must be enclosed in quotes, either single (`'`) or double (`\"`), e.g., `<element attribute=\"value\">`.\n\n4. **Unescaped Characters**: Special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, etc., should be escaped as entities (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`).\n\n5. **Duplicate Attributes**: An element must not have two attributes with the same name.\n\n6. **Missing Root Element**: There should be only one root element that encloses all other elements.\n\n7. **Incorrect Header**: The XML declaration, if present, must be at the start of the document (`<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>`) and properly formed.\n\nTo determine if an XML file is free of structural errors, it would typically be validated against these rules using an XML parser or validator.
