Variations in Image Links: Image links can come in various forms – they might be local file paths or URLs, and they could vary in terms of how they are formatted within the text.\n\n3. Filtering Non-Image Links: The parser needs to differentiate between links to images and links to other types of content or files to ensure only image filenames are extracted.\n\n4. Diverse Image Formats: There are multiple image file formats (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser will need to recognize all the possible image file extensions.\n\n5. Handling Relative and Absolute Paths: Image paths could be given as absolute paths, relative paths, or even without any path if they are in the same directory as the ORG file.\n\n6. Capturing Filenames Only: Depending on the requirement, it might be necessary to extract just the filenames and not the full paths, which can involve additional string processing.\n\n7. Dealing with Embedded Base64 Images: In some cases, images might be embedded directly in the file using Base64 encoding instead of being linked as separate files.\n\nBy considering these potential challenges ahead of time, we can better prepare to parse the ORG file accurately and extract the required information."
