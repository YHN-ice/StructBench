Images might be included as links or with specific syntax. Understanding this format is crucial to correctly identify image file names.\n\n2. **Image Link Variations**: Images can be linked in multiple ways within an ORG file, such as using local file paths, URLs, or possibly inline base64-encoded images. The parser must handle all potential variations to extract image names.\n\n3. **Link Syntax Variations**: In ORG files, links could be expressed with different syntaxes or within descriptive brackets. The challenge lies in accurately recognizing and parsing these syntax variations to find the image file names.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image files could be referenced using absolute or relative paths, and the parser needs to distinguish between these to print only the file names, not the entire path.\n\n5. **Embedded vs. Linked Images**: Images might not be directly linked but embedded in some cases, which means the actual file name might not be present in the text, making extraction impossible without additional context.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Knowing which file extensions are considered images (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) is important, as the parser should only list files that are indeed image formats.\n\n7. **Text Ambiguity**: The ORG file could contain non-image links or text that looks like an image file but isn't. The parser should be able to differentiate actual image links from other content.\n\n8. **Escape Characters and Formatting**: Certain characters may be escaped or formatted in a way that makes it difficult to recognize them as part of a file name without proper parsing logic.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing strategy needs to be employed that can handle different syntaxes and file path formats, differentiate between image and non-image content, and manage escape characters and formatting nuances."
