It's important to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped markers.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Bold text that spans multiple lines could be tricky to handle if the parser is line-based and does not account for multi-line formatting.\n\n7. **Embedded Links or Inline Footnotes**: An ORG file might contain links or footnotes within bold text, which could affect the parsing process.\n\n8. **Contextual Parsing**: Some bold texts might only be considered as such based on the context they appear in, such as within specific header levels or list items.\n\nTo handle these challenges effectively, the parser needs to be robust and flexible, capable of handling variations in formatting, dealing with nested structures, and recognizing escape sequences correctly."
