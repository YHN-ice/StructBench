If the syntax used is non-standard or if there are typos, it might be more difficult to correctly identify all the included images.\n\n2. **File Path Formats**: Images can be included with absolute, relative, or even remote file paths. Ensuring that each type is handled correctly may be a challenge.\n\n3. **Link Formats**: Images can be inserted as plain links or as part of a descriptive link. The parser must be able to extract image file names from both formats.\n\n4. **Embedded Base64 Images**: If images are included as base64 encoded strings directly in the ORG file, identifying and extracting the information about these images could be more complex.\n\n5. **Commented-Out Lines**: Some lines including image links might be commented out. Depending on the requirements, it may or may not be necessary to filter out these occurrences.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Identifying what constitutes an image file may require checking for common image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.). However, some image files may have non-standard extensions or no extensions at all.\n\n7. **Multiline Links**: In rare cases, an image link might be broken up across multiple lines, which would require more complex parsing to correctly identify the image file.\n\nOnce the input ORG file is provided, I can apply the appropriate extraction logic to identify and list the image file names."
