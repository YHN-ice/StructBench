Typically, it is denoted by wrapping the text with asterisks (e.g., `*bold*`), but this could vary.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold text may be embedded within other text or inline with other formatting styles (like italic, underline, strike-through, etc.), which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other bold blocks or other types of formatting blocks, leading to a need for careful parsing to extract only the correct level of emphasis.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: There may be escape characters that prevent asterisks from being interpreted as bold markers, which need to be considered so they are not mistakenly extracted as bold text.\n\n5. **Multiple Bold Sections in a Single Line**: A line might contain multiple bold sections, and each of these will need to be individually recognized and extracted.\n\n6. **Non-text Content**: The ORG file might contain non-text content (like links, code blocks, or images) where the asterisks do not denote bold text but are part of another syntax structure.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Asterisks used for purposes other than denoting bold text (such as for bullet points or other organizational purposes) could lead to false positives if not handled correctly.\n\n8. **Consistency and Edge Cases**: There may be inconsistencies or edge cases in the file where the rules for bold text are not followed strictly, leading to challenges in accurately identifying all instances of bold text.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser must have robust pattern recognition capabilities designed to specifically identify and handle the nuances of ORG file syntax for bold text formatting. It should ignore false positives and properly handle nested formatting and escape characters."
