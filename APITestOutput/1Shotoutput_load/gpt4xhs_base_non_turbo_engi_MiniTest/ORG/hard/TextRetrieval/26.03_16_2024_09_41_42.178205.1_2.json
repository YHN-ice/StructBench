Here are potential difficulties that might occur:\n\n1. **Parsing Syntax**: ORG files have their own syntax for embedding or linking to images. If the parser is not well-versed with this syntax, it might miss some embedded or linked images.\n\n2. **Image Formats**: The ORG file could include images in various formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.). The parser has to recognize and extract all the different types of image formats.\n\n3. **Links vs Embedding**: Images can be either directly embedded into the ORG file or linked from external sources. The parser must distinguish between these two cases.\n\n4. **File Paths**: Image files could be referenced with absolute or relative paths, and they could be located in different directories or online URLs.\n\n5. **Textual Ambiguity**: Sometimes, text within an ORG file could resemble a file path or URL but isn't an actual image file reference. The parser needs to correctly identify actual image references.\n\n6. **Markup Variations**: Depending on the version of ORG mode and user preferences, the markup used to include images can vary, which can affect the parser's ability to identify them accurately.\n\n7. **False Positives/Negatives**: The parser might incorrectly identify non-image file names as images (false positives) or miss actual image file references (false negatives).\n\n8. **Hidden or Commented References**: Images that are commented out or hidden within the document should typically not be extracted, and distinguishing these from valid references may be tricky.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll be better able to address these challenges and extract the image file names accurately."
