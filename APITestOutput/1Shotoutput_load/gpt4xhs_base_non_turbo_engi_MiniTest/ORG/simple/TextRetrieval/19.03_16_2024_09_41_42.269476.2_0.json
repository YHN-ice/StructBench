However, there might be variations or errors in markup, such as uneven asterisks (e.g., `*bold**`), which could complicate extraction.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underline, or code blocks. It will be important to correctly parse the nested structures to extract only the bold text.\n\n3. **Non-standard extensions**: If the ORG file uses non-standard extensions or a custom configuration that changes the way bold text is marked up, it could affect the extraction process.\n\n4. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which would require handling line breaks and continuity of the bold formatting.\n\n5. **Escaped asterisks**: Asterisks used in the document for other purposes might be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), and these should not be confused with actual bold formatting.\n\n6. **Asterisks within words**: Sometimes asterisks might be used within words for other reasons (e.g., `aster*isk`), and it's important to distinguish these from bold markup.\n\n7. **Asterisks in code blocks or examples**: Asterisks in code blocks or quoted examples should not be interpreted as bold formatting.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help in accurately extracting the bold texts from the ORG file. Please provide the ORG file content so that I can proceed with extracting the bold texts."
