This diversity requires careful consideration when parsing.\n\n6. **Inclusion of non-image files:** Besides images, an ORG file may contain links to other types of files. It would be important to distinguish between image files and other files.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it will be important to understand the syntax used for including images in the ORG file and apply the appropriate regex or parsing strategy to identify and extract the relevant file paths. Once you provide the input file, I'll be able to proceed with a more focused strategy."
