However, there may be variations or inconsistencies in how bold is applied, such as extra spaces (e.g., `* bold *`) or the use of multiple asterisks (e.g., `**bold**`).\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting tags, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. This can complicate the parsing process as the parser needs to distinguish between different formatting layers.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: Bold text may include special characters or symbols that need to be correctly interpreted or could interfere with the parsing logic.\n\n4. **Partial Bold Text**: Sometimes only part of a word or sentence is bolded, which requires the parser to accurately identify partial bold formatting without mistakenly including adjacent non-bold text.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as for bullet points or as multiplication symbols in code blocks. The parser needs to differentiate between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n6. **Contextual Consideration**: Depending on whether the parser needs to understand the context in which the bold text appears, it may require more sophisticated logic to determine the relevance of the bold text within the document's structure.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Characters that are meant to represent literal asterisks rather than formatting may be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`). The parser must handle these correctly.\n\n8. **File Corruption or Errors**: The ORG file might have corruption or errors that could lead to incorrect parsing, such as missing closing asterisks for bold sections.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file content you'd like me to parse so I can proceed with extracting the bold texts."
