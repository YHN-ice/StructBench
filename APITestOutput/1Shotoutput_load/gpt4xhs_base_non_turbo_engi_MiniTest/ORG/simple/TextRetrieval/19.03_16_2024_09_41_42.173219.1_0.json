Identifying the syntax for bold text in ORG files: Bold text in ORG files is typically marked up with asterisks or equal signs. For example, `*bold text*` or `=bold text=`. Knowing the exact syntax is crucial.\n\n2. Handling nested markup: An ORG file may contain nested formatting, where bold text could also include other styles such as italic, underlined, or code. It's important to extract only the bold text while ignoring other nested styles.\n\n3. Dealing with multiline bold text: Sometimes, bold formatting may span across multiple lines. Ensuring that the parser can handle multiline formatting without losing context is important.\n\n4. Differentiating between markup and content: Asterisks and equal signs might be used in the content for purposes other than formatting (e.g., in lists or mathematical expressions). The parser needs to distinguish between these uses.\n\n5. Handling incomplete or incorrect formatting: The ORG file may contain errors or incomplete formatting which could make parsing difficult. For example, a missing closing asterisk could lead to incorrect extraction.\n\n6. Parsing performance: If the ORG file is large, parsing performance could be an issue and may require optimized algorithms or streaming methods to handle the data efficiently.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I can proceed with extracting the bold texts considering these potential obstacles."
