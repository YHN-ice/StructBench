Embedded images could be base64 encoded or stored in a binary format, which would complicate their extraction.\n\n4. **Non-Standard Syntax**: If the ORG file uses non-standard or custom ways to include images, it might be hard to identify these without specific rules.\n\n5. **Markup Variability**: ORG files can contain a lot of markup and special characters, so parsing the correct filenames requires handling this complexity.\n\n6. **Multiple File Types**: Image references might not be limited to a single file type (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), so the parser must recognize various image file extensions.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file content so I can proceed with extracting the image file names."
