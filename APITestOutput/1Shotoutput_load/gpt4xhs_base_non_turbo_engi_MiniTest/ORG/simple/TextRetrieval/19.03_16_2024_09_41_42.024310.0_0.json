However, variations or errors in syntax (e.g., mismatched asterisks, additional spaces) could lead to missed instances or incorrect extractions.\n\n2. **Embedded formatting**: Bold text might be embedded within other formatting options, such as links, code, or italic text. This can complicate the extraction process if the parser is not designed to handle nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users might escape asterisks (\\*) that are meant to represent the literal asterisk character rather than denote bold formatting. The parser must differentiate between escaped and unescaped asterisks.\n\n4. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text could span multiple lines. The parser must be able to recognize bold formatting that is not confined to a single line.\n\n5. **False positives from other uses of asterisks**: Asterisks are used in ORG mode for other purposes, such as for list items or headings. The parser must accurately identify when asterisks are used for bold formatting versus other functions.\n\n6. **File format and encoding issues**: If the ORG file uses a specific encoding or contains special characters, the parser must be able to handle these correctly to avoid misinterpretation of the text.\n\nAssuming that we will encounter a well-formed ORG file, the parser will need to be robust enough to handle these potential issues to accurately extract and print all bold texts separated by a newline character."
