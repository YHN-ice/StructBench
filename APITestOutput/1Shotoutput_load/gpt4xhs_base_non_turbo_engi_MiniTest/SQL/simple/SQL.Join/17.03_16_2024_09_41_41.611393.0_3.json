However, there could be several difficulties and obstacles during this process:\n\n1. **Data formatting issues:** The datatable might have inconsistencies in data formatting, which could affect the parsing process. For example, heights could be recorded in different units (centimeters, meters, inches) that need to be standardized before comparison.\n\n2. **Missing data:** Some records could have missing or incomplete information regarding height or location of work which would require a decision on how to handle these cases (e.g., exclude from count, estimate based on other data, etc.).\n\n3. **Duplicate entries:** If the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there may be duplicate entries that need to be identified and handled correctly to avoid counting the same person more than once.\n\n4. **Data accuracy:** The data provided could contain errors or inaccuracies that could lead to incorrect results, such as typos in the height or work location fields.\n\n5. **Complex data structure:** The way the data is structured might require complex queries or algorithms to correctly identify and count the people who work in WA and are taller than 168.\n\n6. **Performance issues:** If the datatable is very large, performance could be an issue and it might be necessary to utilize efficient parsing and querying techniques.\n\n7. **Variations in location representation:** The location \"WA\" could be represented in multiple ways (e.g., Washington, WA, W.A., etc.), and all variations would need to be accounted for to accurately identify all relevant records.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties in advance can help in preparing to overcome them when parsing the datatable to answer the given question."
