Large Data Size: If the datatable is very large, it might take a long time to process or require special techniques to handle efficiently.\n\n3. Inconsistent Data: There may be inconsistencies in how salary data is recorded (e.g., different currencies, including or excluding bonuses, etc.), which could complicate comparisons.\n\n4. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows might have missing salary information, which would make it difficult to determine whether those individuals should be counted.\n\n5. Duplicate Records: There could be duplicate records for the same person with varying salaries, and it would be necessary to determine which record correctly represents their salary.\n\n6. Data Type Issues: Salary data could be stored as strings with currency symbols or commas, requiring conversion to numerical values before comparison.\n\n7. Ambiguous PrimeKey: If the primeKey is not clearly defined or there are errors in the primeKeys, identifying unique individuals may be challenging.\n\n8.
