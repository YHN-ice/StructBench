Data Format: The format of the data table might not be standardized, necessitating preprocessing to make it uniform for parsing.\n\n5. Ambiguous PrimeKey: If the primeKey (unique identifier) is not well-defined or has duplicates that are not supposed to be there, it could complicate identifying unique individuals.\n\n6. Complex Data Structures: The data table might be in a complex, nested, or hierarchical format that requires advanced parsing techniques.\n\n7.
