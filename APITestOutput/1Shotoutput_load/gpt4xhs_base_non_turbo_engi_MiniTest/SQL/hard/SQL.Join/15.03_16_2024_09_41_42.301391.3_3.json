Variations in how heights or state codes are recorded could complicate the analysis.\n\n2. **Missing or Incomplete Data:** If some rows are missing height information or do not specify the state where individuals work, it may be difficult to include them in the count.\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries:** There might be duplicate entries for individuals (rows with the same primeKey), which have to be identified and handled correctly to avoid overcounting.\n\n4. **Data Volume:** If the dataset is exceptionally large, it might be challenging to process it efficiently.\n\n5. **Unit of Measurement:** The height data could be in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches), and it would need to be standardized to one unit for accurate comparison.\n\n6. **Data Types and Parsing Errors:** Ensuring that the data types are correctly interpreted (e.g., numerical data for height) is crucial. Parsing errors might lead to incorrect data being read.\n\n7. **Filtering and Sorting Logic:** Implementing the correct logic to filter for people working in TX and sorting or comparing heights accurately is vital.\n\n8. **Reporting of Height:** The way height is reported (e.g., 180, 180cm, 1.80m) will affect how the data is parsed and compared.\n\nOnce these potential issues are addressed, parsing the data should yield an accurate count of people working in TX who are taller than 180."
