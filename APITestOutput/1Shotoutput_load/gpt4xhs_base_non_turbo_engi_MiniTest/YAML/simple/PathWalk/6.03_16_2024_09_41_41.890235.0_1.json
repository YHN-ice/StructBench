If these documents have their own `subs` arrays, identifying which one is being referred to might be difficult.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is exceptionally large, performance considerations may come into play when parsing it.\n\n6. **Ambiguity**: If there are multiple instances of `subs` arrays at different hierarchy levels or within different objects, it may be unclear which one is being referred to.\n\n7. **Inconsistencies**: If the file has inconsistencies such as mixed data types for IDs or unexpected structures within the `subs` array, accurately extracting the first object's id may be challenging.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, I will need to see the input YAML file and understand its structure.
