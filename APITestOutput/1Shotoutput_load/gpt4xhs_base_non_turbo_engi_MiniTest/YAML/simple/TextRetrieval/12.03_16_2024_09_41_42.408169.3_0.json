If these are used in the document, understanding the referenced values could complicate the extraction of information.\n\n5. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If the object with id 'p' is not in the first document, it would be necessary to parse through multiple documents within the file.\n\n6. **Similar Keys**: There can be multiple objects with similar keys or ids. Identifying and extracting the correct object would require careful attention to the hierarchy and context.\n\nNow that we've identified potential difficulties, please provide the YAML content for the specific question about the object with id 'p' so that I can attempt to parse it and provide the relevant excerpt."
