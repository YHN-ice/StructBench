Tabs are not allowed for indentation.\n2. **Incorrect Key-Value Pairs**: Keys and values are separated by a colon followed by a space. Errors can occur if the colon or space is missing.\n3. **Sequences/Lists Errors**: Lists items are denoted by a leading hyphen and space. Items must be at the same indentation level to belong to the same list.\n4. **Mappings/Dictionaries Errors**: Incorrectly structured mappings where nested keys do not have proper indentation can cause issues.\n5. **Scalar Formatting**: Errors can occur if multiline strings or other scalar values are not formatted correctly.\n6. **Incorrect Use of Quotes**: Single or double quotes need to be used consistently and closed properly.\n7. **Duplicated Keys**: In a map/dictionary, keys must be unique. Duplicated keys are not allowed.\n8. **Invalid Characters**: Some characters have special meanings, and their improper use can cause a structural error.\n\nPlease provide the YAML input so I can check for any structural errors."
