Here are some of the challenges that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Nested Structures**: YAML allows for deeply nested structures which can be complex to navigate. Correctly identifying the path through nested dictionaries and lists is essential.\n\n2. **Lists vs Dictionaries**: YAML supports both lists (arrays) and dictionaries (hashes). Distinguishing between these and using the correct index or key is crucial.\n\n3. **Key Names**: YAML keys are case-sensitive and may include special characters or spaces. It's important to use the exact key name, including the correct case and any special characters.\n\n4. **Aliases & Anchors**: YAML allows defining anchors and using aliases to reference those anchors. If \"c\" is referenced through an alias, it would be necessary to resolve the alias to locate the actual value.\n\n5. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types, including strings, numbers, boolean values, etc. Ensuring that the data type is correctly interpreted when accessing the value is important.\n\n6. **YAML Versioning**: There are different versions of YAML, and some features may vary between versions. The parser needs to adhere to the correct version specifications.\n\n7. **Indentation**: YAML relies heavily on indentation to denote structure. Incorrect indentation could lead to misinterpreting the structure of the document.\n\n8. **Duplicate Keys**: If a YAML file has duplicate keys at the same level, it may be ambiguous which one should be accessed.\n\n9. **File Size and Complexity**: Large and complex YAML files can be harder to parse and may require more resources or time to process correctly.\n\n10. **Interpreting Scalars**: Scalars (single values) in YAML can be plain or quoted, which might influence how they are parsed and accessed.\n\n11. **Comments**: While comments do not affect the structure, they might be present near the value of interest and could potentially cause confusion if not ignored properly by the parser.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, careful consideration of these potential obstacles will be important for accurately determining how to access the value \"c\"."
