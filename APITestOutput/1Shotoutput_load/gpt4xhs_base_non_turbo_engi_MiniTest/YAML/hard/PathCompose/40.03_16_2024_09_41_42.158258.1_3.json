For instance, in Python, you would use `obj['key1']['key2']...`, but in other languages or contexts, the syntax might differ.\n\n6. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows defining complex data structures using anchors and aliases. Resolving these might be necessary to access the correct value.\n\n7. **Variations in Implementations**: Different parsers might have slightly different rules or support different subsets of YAML features, potentially leading to inconsistencies.\n\n8. **Non-Standard Extensions**: Some YAML files might use non-standard extensions or tags that are not universally supported by all parsers.\n\nBefore proceeding, it would be essential to have access to the actual YAML input to understand its structure and content, which will define the exact way to access the value \"wy\"."
