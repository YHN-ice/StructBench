Mapping Errors: Keys within a map must be unique; if there are duplicate keys, that would be considered an error.\n4. Sequence/List Errors: List items typically start with a dash followed by a space; if the space is missing, it is an error.\n5. Scalar Formatting: If a scalar (a single value) contains special characters or line breaks, it may need to be enclosed in quotes or formatted as a block.\n6.
