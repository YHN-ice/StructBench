Identifying the deepest level requires a recursive or iterative strategy that can handle any depth.\n\n2. **Mixed Content Types:** Lists or dictionaries may contain mixed types, including scalars, other lists, or dictionaries. The parser must be able to distinguish these types and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **YAML Aliases and Anchors:** YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors which can create references to other parts of the document. The parser must resolve these references correctly to determine the nesting levels.\n\n4. **Multiline Strings:** YAML supports multiline strings which can affect how content is parsed and presented. It's important that these are handled correctly to ensure accurate representation of the deepest objects.\n\n5. **Duplicate Keys:** While considered invalid in JSON, YAML technically allows duplicate keys within a map. A parser might need to address how to handle such occurrences if they arise.\n\n6. **Implicit Data Types:** YAML has implicit typing, which means it will automatically convert strings to integers, floats, booleans, etc., if they match certain patterns. The parser needs to preserve the original data type as specified in the YAML content.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, my approach when parsing a YAML file will involve systematically traversing the structure, keeping track of the depth, and identifying scalar values that are not part of any list or dictionary, regardless of how deeply they are nested. Once the input YAML content is provided, I'll be able to apply this strategy to extract the required excerpts."
