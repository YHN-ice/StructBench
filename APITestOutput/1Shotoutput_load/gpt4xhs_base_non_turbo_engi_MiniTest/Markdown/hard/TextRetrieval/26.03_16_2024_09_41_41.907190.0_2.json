We'll need to handle all possible syntaxes to ensure we catch every image.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Sometimes, images are included using inline HTML rather than Markdown syntax. This requires parsing HTML within the Markdown to find image sources.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Images might be included using reference-style links, where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: There might be escaped characters that look like image syntax but are not meant to be processed as such.\n\n5. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The image paths could be relative or absolute, and identifying the file names might require distinguishing between the path and the file name.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown**: Images included in nested structures, like lists or blockquotes, could complicate extraction due to additional characters or indentation.\n\n7. **Non-image Links**: Ensuring that we don't mistakenly extract non-image links (like regular hyperlinks) as image files.\n\n8. **Image Titles and Captions**: Some Markdown renderers allow for titles or captions, which could be confused with the image file names if not properly parsed.\n\n9. **Broken Markdown**: We might encounter incorrectly formatted Markdown which could lead to missing some image references or extracting incorrect information.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing approach is needed that can recognize and handle the many variations in how images can be included in Markdown files."
