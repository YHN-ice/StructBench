Tools like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc., might have their own Markdown flavors.\n\n2. **Various ways to denote bold**: In Markdown, bold text can be expressed in multiple ways, typically with double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__`. We need to ensure to catch all possible syntaxes.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**: Bold text in Markdown can have nested formatting, such as italic or code spans within it. The parser must be able to handle nested elements without breaking the extraction.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores could be escaped within the text (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), meaning they shouldn't be treated as formatting characters. The parsing logic must account for backslashes that escape formatting characters.\n\n5. **False positives**: Asterisks and underscores are also used for other formatting (like italics) or within code blocks where they shouldn't be interpreted as bold markers.\n\n6. **Inline code blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (using backticks `) should not be considered, even if they contain what looks like bold markers.\n\n7. **Partial overlap with other formatting**: Situations where bold formatting starts within another formatting element and ends outside of it, or vice versa, could potentially cause issues.\n\n8. **Text across multiple lines**: Bold text in Markdown can span across multiple lines. The parser needs to handle multiline cases properly.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the correct approach to parsing the Markdown file would involve writing or employing a robust Markdown parser that can understand context and differentiate between actual bold text and false positives."
