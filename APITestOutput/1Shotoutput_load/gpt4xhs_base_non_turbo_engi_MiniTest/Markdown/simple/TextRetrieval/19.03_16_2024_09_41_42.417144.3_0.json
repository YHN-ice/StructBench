The most common ones are `**text**` and `__text__`. We need to account for both patterns.\n\n2. **Nesting**: Bold text might be nested within other elements like lists, quotes, or code blocks. It's important to ensure that the extraction process doesn't get confused by such nesting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the markdown characters to prevent them from being parsed, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to recognize and ignore escaped sequences.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (e.g., `` `code here` ``) should not be interpreted as bold, even if it includes `**` or `__`.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: Markdown sometimes allows for text styling to span across multiple lines. This can complicate the matching process.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There may be occurrences of double asterisks or underscores that do not correspond to bold formatting (e.g., mathematical expressions, typographical emphasis, etc.) and should be ignored.\n\n7. **Partial Overlaps**: There might be overlapping formatting markers for bold, italic, or other styles, which could cause incorrect extractions.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the document is very large, the process of parsing and extracting bold text must be efficient to avoid long processing times.\n\nThese challenges would require careful consideration when creating a regular expression or parsing algorithm to correctly identify and extract all the bold texts from a markdown file."
