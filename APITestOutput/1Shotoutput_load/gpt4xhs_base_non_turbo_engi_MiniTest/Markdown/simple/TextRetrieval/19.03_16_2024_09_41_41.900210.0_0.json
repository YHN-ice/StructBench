I'll need to be able to recognize all of these patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like links `[link description](url)` or italicized text `*italic*` or `_italic_`, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: The bold syntax might be escaped with a backslash to display the literal asterisks or underscores, like `\\**not bold\\**`, which should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks using backticks `` `text` `` should be ignored even if they contain what seems like bold syntax.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Text within code blocks (indented by 4 spaces or a tab) or fenced code blocks (enclosed by ````` or `~~~`) should be ignored as formatting inside these blocks is not processed.\n\n6. **List Items and Blockquotes**: Bold text might be part of list items or blockquotes, which could involve additional parsing logic.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Characters that are used for other purposes but can be confused with bold markers, like asterisks in bullet points or mathematical expressions, must not be treated as bold markers.\n\n8. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which would require multiline pattern matching.\n\nOnce the input file is available, I will need to consider these potential issues to accurately extract all the bold texts."
