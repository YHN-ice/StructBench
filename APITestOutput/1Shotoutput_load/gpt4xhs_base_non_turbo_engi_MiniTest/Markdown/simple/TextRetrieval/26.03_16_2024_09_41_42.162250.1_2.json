The potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process include:\n\n1. **Variations in Image Syntax**: Markdown allows for slight variations in the image syntax, such as optional alt text, title text, and even reference-style images where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked via relative paths, which are related to the location of the Markdown file, or absolute paths, which point to a fixed location. It's important to handle both correctly.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax. A parser should be able to recognize both.\n\n4. **Linked Images**: Sometimes an image is not embedded but linked. The parser should differentiate between embedded images that need to be extracted and mere links to images that are not actually included in the file.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: There could be escaped characters that complicate the parsing, such as an exclamation mark that is escaped to prevent it from being interpreted as an image.\n\n6. **Text That Looks Like an Image**: Sometimes there might be text within the document that looks like it could be the Markdown syntax for an image but isn't, such as a commented-out line or an example of the syntax within a code block.\n\n7. **File Formats**: Images can come in various file formats (jpg, png, gif, svg, etc.), and all should be handled.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There could be multiple images on a single line, which should all be extracted separately.\n\n9. **Invalid or Broken Links**: Some images might have invalid paths or URLs that won't resolve to actual images.\n\n10. **Nested Markdown Elements**: In some cases, the image syntax could be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes, which may add complexity to the parsing logic. \n\nThese are some challenges that one may need to consider when attempting to parse images from a Markdown file."
