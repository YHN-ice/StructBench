The parser must be able to recognize all valid bold syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements, like links `[text](url)`, inline code `` `code` ``, or italicized text `*text*`. The parser should be able to handle these nested elements without breaking the bold text extraction.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of the Markdown syntax might be escaped with a backslash (`\\`), like `\\**not bold\\**`, which means they should not be treated as Markdown formatting.\n\n4. **Partial Syntax Matches**: There might be instances where the bold syntax is not correctly closed, for example, `**text`, which can lead to incorrect extraction.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented with spaces) and inline code (enclosed by single backticks) shouldn't be parsed for Markdown formatting like bold text.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: In some flavors of Markdown, line breaks can affect the rendering of bold text. The parser needs to account for this in cases where bold text may span multiple lines.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Texts that look like bold syntax but aren't meant to be, such as when discussing the syntax itself or in quoted blocks, could be mistakenly extracted.\n\n8. **Ambiguous Cases**: There may be ambiguous cases where it's not clear if the text should be bold or not, depending on the interpretation of the Markdown rules.\n\n9. **Performance Issues**: If dealing with large files or large amounts of bold text, performance may be an issue and the parser must be optimized for efficient searching and extraction.\n\n10. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: Different platforms and Markdown processors might have slightly different rules or extensions for what constitutes bold text, so the parser needs to be adaptable or configured according to the specific flavor of Markdown being used.\n\nThe parser needs to be robust enough to handle these scenarios and still correctly extract all bold texts while ignoring false positives and non-bold elements."
