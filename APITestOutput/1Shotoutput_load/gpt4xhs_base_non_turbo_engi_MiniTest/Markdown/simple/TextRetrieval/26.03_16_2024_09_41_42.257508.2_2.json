This would require parsing HTML syntax in addition to Markdown.\n\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images:**\n   - Images embedded directly into the markdown using Base64 encoding will not have a filename as such, but rather a data URI which could be lengthy and needs careful handling.\n\n6. **Comments or Disabled Image Links:**\n   - Sometimes images might be commented out or their links disabled (using characters like `![]()` without a URL or adding characters to make it not-parsed by the Markdown processor).\n\n7. **False Positives:**\n   - Text that looks like an image link but isn't intended to be one (e.g., examples of how to write an image link in a tutorial) could lead to extracting incorrect information.\n\nWhen you provide the input file, I'll try to account for these potential difficulties and obstacles by looking explicitly for common patterns that indicate an image link and extract filenames accordingly."
