The most common is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but there could be variations in the syntax.\n\n2. **Image File Extensions**: We need to look for common image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.). If the Markdown file includes images with less common extensions, they could be missed.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows images to be included using reference-style links, which separates the URL from the image markup. This requires tracking references and might complicate extraction.\n\n4. **Inlined Base64 Images**: Sometimes images are inlined using Base64 encoding directly into the Markdown file. Distinguishing these from external file links and deciding whether to count them as \"files\" could be a challenge.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Users might escape the traditional Markdown image syntax intentionally or by accident, which could present parsing challenges.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images could be nested within other elements, like lists or blockquotes, which may affect how the parser extracts the image filenames.\n\n7. **Relative vs. Absolute URLs**: Images can be linked using relative paths or absolute URLs. We need to decide whether to extract only filenames or full paths for images hosted externally.\n\n8. **Markdown Parsing Libraries**: Depending on if a library is used for parsing, its specific quirks or limitations may affect how images are extracted.\n\n9. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can contain raw HTML, including `<img>` tags with images that need to be extracted as well. \n\n10. **Incorrect Syntax**: Typographical errors in the Markdown file could result in malformed image syntax which might complicate extraction or lead to missing images. \n\nAddressing these challenges will depend on the actual input and requirements of the task at hand.
