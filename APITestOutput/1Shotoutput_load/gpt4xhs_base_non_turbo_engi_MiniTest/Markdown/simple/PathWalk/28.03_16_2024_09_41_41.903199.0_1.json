Identifying the correct section and subsection would require parsing the heading levels correctly.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the Markdown file uses inconsistent formatting for sections and subsections, it may be difficult to programmatically identify them. For example, some subsections might use `###` while others might use `##` or even `*`.\n\n3. **Nested Sections**: There can be multiple nested subsections, and identifying the \"1st subsection under the 1st section\" would involve recognizing the correct nesting level.\n\n4. **Non-sequential Content**: There may be non-content elements like images, links, or lists that need to be correctly handled or ignored depending on the context of the question.\n\n5. **Identifying the Correct Index**: Markdown files do not have an indexing system, so identifying the \"1st\" section or subsection means parsing from the beginning and counting occurrences of headings that define sections or subsections.\n\n6. **Large Files and Performance**: If the Markdown file is very large, performance could be affected when parsing and finding the required content.\n\n7. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: Different flavors of Markdown (like GitHub Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.) might have slightly different rules or extensions which can affect parsing.\n\n8. **Links and References**: Some sections/subsections might contain links or references that need to be resolved or displayed correctly within the excerpt.\n\n9. **Code blocks & Escape Characters**: Sections or subsections might contain code blocks or escape characters that need to be handled properly to maintain formatting.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a systematic approach to parsing the Markdown file would be required, taking into account these potential difficulties."
