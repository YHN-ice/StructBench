        "To access the value \"f\" in the given input, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the root object, `obj`.\n2. Find the first sub-object with `id` equals to \"subs\".\n3. Inside the sub-object, find the first sub-object with `id` equals to \"subs\".\n4. Inside the second sub-object, find the third level sub-object with `id` equals to \"S\".\n5. Finally, you will get the value \"f\" from the third level sub-object with `S` key.\n\nIn your specific case, you have given the path as `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][1][\"S\"]`, which will correctly give you the value \"f\".\n\nIf you want to generalize this process for any given object and any depth of nesting, you can use a recursive function. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\ndef get_value(obj, path):\n    # Split the path into parts and iterate over them\n    for key in path.split(\".\"):\n        # Get the current object from obj\n        current_obj = obj\n        # Iterate over each key in the path\n        for k in key:\n            # Get the current key value from current_obj\n            current_obj = current_obj[k]\n        # If we've reached the desired object, return the value\n        if current_obj == obj:\n            return current_obj\n    # If we didn't find the object, return None or an error message\n    return None\n```\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n\n```python\nobj = {\n    \"id\": \"s\",\n    \"Z\": \"o\",\n    \"Y\": \"n\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"t\",\n            \"X\": \"m\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"u\",\n                    \"W\": \"l\",\n                    \"subs\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": \"v\",\n                            \"V\": \"k\",\n                            \"U\": \"j\",\n                            \"subs\": []\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"id\": \"w\",\n                            \"T\": \"i\",\n                            \"S\": \"h\",\n                            \"subs\": []\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"ab\",\n            \"M\": \"b\",\n            \"L\": \"a\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"bb\",\n                    \"K\": \"zy\",\n                    \"J\": \"yy\",\n                    \"subs\": [\n                        {\n                            \"id\": \"cb\",\n                            \"I\": \"xy\",\n                            \"subs\": []  # This one doesn't have 'S' key.
