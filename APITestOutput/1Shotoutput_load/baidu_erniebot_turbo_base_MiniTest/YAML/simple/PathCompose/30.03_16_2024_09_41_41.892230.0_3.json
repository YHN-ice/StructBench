        "To access the value \"g\" in the given JSON structure, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, you need to get the value \"p\" from the root object.\n2. Then, you need to access the value \"Y\" from the \"p\" object.\n3. Finally, you can access the value \"g\" from the \"Y\" object.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_str = \"\"\"\n{\n    \"id\": \"o\",\n    \"Z\": \"h\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"p\",\n            \"Y\": \"g\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"q\",\n                    \"X\": \"f\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Convert JSON string to Python dictionary\njson_obj = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Get the value \"p\" from the root object\np = json_obj[\"subs\"][0]\n\n# Access the value \"Y\" from the \"p\" object\ng = p[\"Y\"]\n\nprint(g)  # Output: g\n```\nThis code will print the value \"g\". Please note that this assumes that the JSON structure is always the same and that you know the keys to access each level in advance. If you don't know the keys in advance, you might need a more dynamic approach, such as using a recursive function or a data structure that allows for dynamic lookup."
