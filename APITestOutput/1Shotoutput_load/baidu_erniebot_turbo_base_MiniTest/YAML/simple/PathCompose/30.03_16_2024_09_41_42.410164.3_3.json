Retrieve the value \"m\" from the substructure of \"r\" using `obj[key or index 3]`\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n\n```python\n# Assuming obj is your input object\nid = \"p\"\nZ = \"o\"\nsubs = [\n    {\n        \"id\": \"q\",\n        \"Y\": \"n\",\n        \"subs\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"r\",\n                \"X\": \"m\",\n                \"subs\": []\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\n# Retrieve the value \"m\" from the nested structure\nvalue_m = obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"]  # This will give you \"m\"\n```\nNote that you can also use a recursive function to handle nested structures like this, if needed."
