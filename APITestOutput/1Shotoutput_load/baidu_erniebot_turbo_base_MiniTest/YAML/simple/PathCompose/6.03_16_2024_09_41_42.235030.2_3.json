        "To access the value \"v\", you can follow the same pattern as you did for accessing \"o\". You can use the following syntax:\n\n\n```python\nobj[\"subs\"][1][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"]\n```\nIn your provided input, the value \"v\" is stored in the \"X\" key of the second sub-object of the second sub-object of the \"subs\" property. Therefore, you need to follow the same nested structure to access it.\n\nFor your second question, here's how you can access the value \"v\":\n\n\n```python\nobj[\"subs\"][2][\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]\n```\nIn this case, the value \"v\" is stored in the \"Y\" key of the first sub-object of the third sub-object of the \"subs\" property. You need to follow the same nested structure to access it.\n\nMake sure to replace \"obj\" with the actual name of your object variable or with a valid path to your object. You can also adjust the indices or keys as needed to access different values within your object structure."
