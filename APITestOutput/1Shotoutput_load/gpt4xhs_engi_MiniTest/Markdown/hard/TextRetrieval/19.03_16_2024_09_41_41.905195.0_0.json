The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` and double underscores `__bold text__`. Both need to be identified and parsed correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text in Markdown can have nested elements like italic, code, or links. Parsing such text requires recognizing and handling nested formatting correctly without losing the bold formatting.\n\n3. **Partial Matches**: Sometimes text might have an asterisk or underscore that isn't meant to make text bold, such as when used in expressions, bullet points, or to indicate emphasis without bolding.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows escaping of special characters with a backslash (`\\`). For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be treated as bold.\n\n5. **Incorrectly Formatted Bold Text**: Sometimes the Markdown syntax might be incorrect, such as missing a closing asterisk, which would technically not make the text bold according to Markdown rules.\n\n6. **Inline vs. Block Elements**: Bold text can appear either inline with other text or as standalone blocks. The parser must be able to handle both scenarios.\n\n7. **Whitespace Handling**: In some Markdown processors, whitespace immediately after the opening asterisks or before the closing asterisks can prevent the text from being formatted as bold. The parser must decide how strict to be about whitespace rules.\n\n8. **Code Blocks**: Text inside code blocks should not be parsed for formatting, so it's important to distinguish code blocks from other text.\n\n9. **Links Containing Bold Text**: Markdown links with bold text in either the link text or the link title attribute can complicate parsing.\n\n10. **Platform-Specific Flavors**: Different platforms (like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab) may have subtle differences in how they parse Markdown, so understanding the context in which the Markdown is used may be important.\n\nTo successfully extract bold texts, you'll need to consider these challenges and ensure that your parsing logic is robust enough to handle the diverse ways that bold text can appear in a Markdown file."
