Usually, headers of different levels are used, but the parser must correctly identify which headers correspond to sections and which correspond to subsections.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Header Levels**: Different documents may use different levels of headers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to denote sections and subsections. The parser must adapt to these variations.\n\n3. **Nesting Levels**: The parser must correctly understand the nesting level of the subsection to ensure that it is indeed the 2nd subsection under the 2nd section, rather than mistakenly extracting content from a different level.\n\n4. **Markdown Variants**: There are various flavors of Markdown, and some may have unique ways to define sections and subsections. The parser must handle the specific variant used in the input file.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Improperly Formatted Markdown**: If the Markdown is not properly formatted (e.g., missing spaces after `#` for headers), it might be difficult to parse.\n\n6. **Inline Markup**: The content within the subsection might contain inline markup (like links, bold text, italics, etc.), and the parser must retain this formatting while extracting the text.\n\n7. **Embedded Content**: The subsection might contain embedded content such as images, code blocks, or tables that need to be handled differently from plain text.\n\n8. **Content Delimiters**: Depending on how content is separated, the parser needs to know when the content of the subsection endsâ€”whether it's at the next header of the same level or at a higher level.\n\n9. **Linked Sections**: Sometimes sections are linked using anchor tags or TOC (table of contents) which could pose additional parsing challenges.\n\nBy addressing these potential difficulties and obstacles, the parser can accurately extract the desired content from a given Markdown file."
