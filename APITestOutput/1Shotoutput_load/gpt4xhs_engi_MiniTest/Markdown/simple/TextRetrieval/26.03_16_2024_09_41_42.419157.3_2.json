These look like `![Alt text][reference-id]` and require finding the corresponding URL reference elsewhere in the Markdown document.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML image tags**: Markdown allows embedding raw HTML, so some images might be included using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Images linked within other elements**: Images could be nested within other elements, such as links, which could further complicate extraction.\n\n5. **Relative vs. absolute URLs**: The URLs for images may be relative paths to files within a project or absolute URLs to resources on the web. Only file names might be needed, not the whole path or URL.\n\n6. **Non-image URLs**: URLs in the Markdown file might point to non-image files or resources, so care should be taken not to mistakenly extract these.\n\n7. **Encoded URLs**: Some image URLs might include URL encoding that needs to be interpreted correctly to identify the file name.\n\n8. **File extensions**: To identify an image file, you would expect certain file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), but there may be less common ones that could be missed if you're only looking for the most common types.\n\n9. **URLs with parameters or fragments**: Image URLs could have query parameters or fragments that are not part of the file name but appear in the URL.\n\n10. **Multiple images on a single line**: There could be multiple image links on a single line, which would need to be individually extracted.\n\nTo correctly extract all image file names, a parser would need to account for these potential issues and correctly identify and process all valid image syntax forms present in the Markdown document provided."
