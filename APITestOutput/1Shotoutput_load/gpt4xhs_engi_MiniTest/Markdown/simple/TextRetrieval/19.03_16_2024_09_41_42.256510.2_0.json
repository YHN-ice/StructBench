The parser must be able to recognize both forms.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text can have other formatting inside it, like italic (`*text*` or `_text_`), code (`text`), or links (`[link text](URL)`). These nested elements could affect how the bold text is extracted.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users can escape formatting characters by preceding them with a backslash (`\\`). For example, `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*` would not be bold text in Markdown. The parser should be able to discern when asterisks are part of the formatting and when they are escaped.\n\n4. **False positives**: Text that is not meant to be bold could be mistakenly detected as such if it contains pairs of asterisks or underscores that are not used for formatting purposes. For instance, mathematical expressions or casual use of asterisks for emphasis.\n\n5. **Incomplete formatting**: Sometimes users make mistakes and do not properly close their bold formatting, which could result in something like `**bold text without closing asterisks` that might confuse the parser.\n\n6. **Multi-line bold text**: Markdown syntax may allow bold text to span multiple lines. However, this is not consistent across different implementations of Markdown, and the parser may need to handle it according to the specifics of the Markdown flavor in use.\n\n7. **Overlapping formatting**: There might be instances where bold formatting overlaps with other formatting types, creating complex patterns that are harder to accurately parse and extract.\n\nTo handle these challenges effectively, the parser must have a robust parsing algorithm that can accurately interpret Markdown syntax and extract the correct pieces of text that are indicated as bold while ignoring false positives and respecting escaped characters and other formatting nuances."
