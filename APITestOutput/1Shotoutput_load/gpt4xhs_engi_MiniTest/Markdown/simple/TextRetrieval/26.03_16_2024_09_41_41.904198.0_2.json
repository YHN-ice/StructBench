Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles in extracting image filenames from a Markdown file:\n\n1. **Variety of Markdown image syntaxes**: Markdown can include images using different syntaxes.

Determining the actual filename might require different handling for each case.\n\n4. **Images within HTML tags**: Some Markdown files include images using raw HTML tags (`<img src=\"...\">`) rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Link vs image confusion**: Sometimes links can be confused with images if not correctly parsed, as their syntax is quite similar with just the exclamation mark differentiating them.\n\n6. **Escaped characters**: Filenames might contain escaped characters that need to be handled properly.\n\n7. **Possible typos or errors in Markdown**: Human errors in the Markdown file might lead to incorrect or broken image syntax, making it harder to reliably extract filenames.\n\n8. **Nested content**: If images are included within other elements, like lists or blockquotes, this might complicate the parsing process.\n\n9. **Variations in alt text**: Alt text could include special characters or parentheses that might confuse a simple parsing algorithm.\n\n10. **Diverse environments**: The Markdown file might be intended for use in different environments (like GitHub or Jekyll), which may support additional syntaxes or features influencing how images are included.\n\nA robust parsing solution would need to address these potential obstacles to accurately extract image filenames from a given Markdown file."
