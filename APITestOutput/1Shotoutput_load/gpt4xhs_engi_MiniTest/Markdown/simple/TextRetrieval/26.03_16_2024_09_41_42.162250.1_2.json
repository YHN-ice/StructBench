These definitions might be separated from the actual place where the image is displayed.\n\n5. **Image titles**: Some Markdown parsers support titles for images, which are indicated by quotes after the URL. The parser must be able to distinguish these from the URL itself.\n\n6. **Alt text complexity**: The alt text for an image could potentially contain brackets (`[ ]`) or other characters that might confuse a simple parser.\n\n7. **Escaped characters**: Characters like `!` or `[` might be escaped in Markdown (with a backslash `\\`), and the parser will need to handle these correctly.\n\n8. **Comments and other markup**: Markdown files can contain HTML comments or other markup that might include image-like syntax which should not be treated as actual images.\n\nThe key to successfully extracting all included image files is to have a robust parser that can handle these complexities and edge cases."
