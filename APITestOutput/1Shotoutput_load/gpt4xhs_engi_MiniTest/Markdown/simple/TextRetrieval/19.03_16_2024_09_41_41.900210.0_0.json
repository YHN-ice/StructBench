We need to make sure to recognize both methods.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold syntax can be nested within other elements (like links, images, or italic text), which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the bold markers (asterisks or underscores) might be escaped with a backslash to display them literally, rather than to format text as bold. We must differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (denoted with backticks `) should not be formatted and therefore any bold markers within them should be ignored.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are also used for other formatting (like italics or bullet points). It's important to distinguish these from bold formatting.\n\n6. **Partial Formatting**: Sometimes, the syntax might be incorrectly used with only one asterisk or underscore at one end of the text. This is not considered bold formatting and should be ignored.\n\n7. **Multi-line Bold Text**: In some cases, bold text might span multiple lines. The parser should be able to handle multiline formatting correctly.\n\nFor the parser to work correctly, it must account for these potential difficulties and accurately identify when text is intended to be bold within the Markdown file's content."
