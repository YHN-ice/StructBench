The parser must be able to recognize both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might have nested formatting, such as italic, strikethrough, or inline code. The parser must extract only the bold text and handle nested formatting correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash to display them literally rather than as formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser must identify these cases and not treat them as bold.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be cases where the formatting syntax is not properly closed, e.g., `**bold`. It's up to the parser how to handle these cases, whether to consider them as bold or not.\n\n5. **Adjacent Formatting**: There may be instances where bold syntax is immediately followed by another syntax without space, which can cause parsing issues, e.g., `**bold****italic**`.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: In some Markdown flavors, line breaks within bold formatting can be valid, while in others, they may end the bold formatting prematurely. The parser needs to follow the appropriate rules.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Text that appears to be formatted as bold due to the presence of asterisks or underscores but isn't actually intended to be bold as per the context might be a false positive.\n\n8. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Bold syntax inside code blocks (` ``` `) and inline code (`` ` ``) should not be treated as formatted text.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must have robust rules and logic to accurately identify bold text according to the Markdown specification being followed."
