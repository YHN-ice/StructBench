The most common is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`. However, images can also be included without alt text or title, or by using reference-style links. The parser must handle all these variations.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**:\n   Images might be linked using relative or absolute paths. The parser needs to account for both while extracting the image file names.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**:\n   Sometimes Markdown files include raw HTML for more complex formatting. An image can be included using an `<img>` tag, which the parser would need to recognize and handle.\n\n4. **Link Confusion**:\n   Markdown syntax for images is very similar to that for links; the only difference is an exclamation mark before the square brackets for images. The parser must distinguish between links and image references correctly.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**:\n   Markdown allows characters to be escaped, including the exclamation mark and square brackets. This could potentially confuse a parser that does not account for escaped characters when looking for image syntax.\n\n6. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**:\n   More than one image can be included on a single line of Markdown. The parser should be able to handle this and extract all image file names accordingly.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that might be faced when parsing a Markdown file to extract image file names. Now, please provide me with the input file so I can begin parsing it for image filenames."
