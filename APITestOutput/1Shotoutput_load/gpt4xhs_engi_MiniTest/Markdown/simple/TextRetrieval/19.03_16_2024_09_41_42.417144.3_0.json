However, we might face a few challenges along the way:\n\n1. **Different Markdown syntaxes for bold**: There are multiple ways to make text bold in Markdown. The most common ones are by using a pair of double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. We need to ensure that all methods for denoting bold text are accounted for.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text in Markdown can contain other formatted text like italic, which uses single asterisks `*italic*` or underscores `_italic_`. We need to be careful to extract only the bold text and not any nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as Markdown formatting (e.g., `**bold \\*text\\***`). We need to handle escaped characters properly so that they don't interfere with the detection of bold formatting.\n\n4. **False positives**: Asterisks and underscores are also used in Markdown for list items and emphasis. We need to distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n5. **Partial formatting**: Occasionally, there may be errors in the Markdown where the formatting is not properly closed (e.g., `**bold text`). Depending on the requirement, we may or may not consider these cases as bold text.\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text formatted as code with backticks ` `` ` or indented lines should not be treated as formatted text, even if it contains sequences of asterisks or underscores.\n\n7. **Links and images**: The syntax for links `[text](URL)` and images `![alt text](URL)` might include asterisks or underscores that are not meant for text formatting.\n\n8. **Line breaks and paragraphs**: Markdown processors have different ways of handling line breaks and new paragraphs. We need to take into account how this impacts the extraction of bold text.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we will need to carefully parse the input Markdown file with attention to context and Markdown syntax rules to accurately extract the bold texts."
