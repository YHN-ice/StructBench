        "1\n\nExplanation:\nTo determine how many people who work in HI (Hawaii) are taller than 178 cm, we need to cross-reference the two tables using the \"primeKey\" to find individuals who satisfy both conditions: working in HI and having a height greater than 178 cm.\n\nFrom the second table (primeKey, status, salary, company, location), we can identify individuals who work in HI by their \"location\" value. We have the following individuals working in HI:\n- primeKey \"d\"\n- primeKey \"j\"\n\nNext, we need to check these individuals' heights from the first table (primeKey, gender, age, name, height, weight, color). We're looking for heights greater than 178 cm.\n\nChecking the heights for \"d\" and \"j\":\n- primeKey \"d\": height is 131 cm (which is less than 178 cm)\n- primeKey \"j\": height is 156 cm (which is less than 178 cm)\n\nTherefore, the number of people who work in HI and are taller than 178 cm is 0.\n\nHowever, there seems to be an inconsistency. The previous question mentions a person with primeKey \"g\" working in WA, but the second dataset shows the same primeKey \"g\" as working in IL. If we assume these datasets are separate and not continuous, then using only the second dataset provided for the HI query, the answer remains 0. If the datasets are continuous and have an error in continuity, it would be impossible to provide an accurate answer without resolving this inconsistency."
