Duplication: The dataset might contain duplicate entries for the same person (same `primeKey`), which could result in overcounting if not properly deduplicated before counting.\n\n4. Data Format: The format of the dataset might make parsing difficult, such as non-standard delimiters, inconsistent column alignment, or mixed data types within the same column.\n\n5. Large Datasets: If the dataset is very large, it could pose performance issues and require efficient parsing methods to handle large volumes of data without excessive processing time.\n\n6. Data Errors: There might be typographical or data entry errors in the gender field, leading to incorrect categorization of individuals.\n\n7. Sensitivity and Privacy: Depending on the source of the data, there might be privacy concerns or sensitivity around gender data that require careful handling or anonymization.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, one would need to define clear rules for data normalization, implement methods for handling missing data, deduplicate entries based on `primeKey`, and ensure robust and efficient parsing algorithms for data extraction.
