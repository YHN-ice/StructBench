Each object should be properly closed with a curly brace.\n\n2. After the first `subs` array within the object with `\"id\": \"w\"` (which has \"X\": \"n\", \"W\": \"m\"), there is a missing closing square bracket for the `subs` array before starting the next object with `\"id\": \"z\"`.\n\n3. Within the objects with `\"id\": \"x\"` and `\"id\": \"eb\"`, there are extra commas following the `subs` arrays before opening new objects. These should either be removed, or if this indicates that the `subs` array should contain another object, that object is missing.\n\n4. There are missing closing square brackets for the `subs` array within the objects with `\"id\": \"z\"` and `\"id\": \"cb\"`.\n\n5.
