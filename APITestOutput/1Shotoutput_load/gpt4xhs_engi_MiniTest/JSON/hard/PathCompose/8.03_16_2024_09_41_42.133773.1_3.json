Navigating through them requires attention to whether to use keys for objects or indices for arrays.\n\n4. **Dynamic Structure**: If the structure of the JSON file is dynamic or not well documented, it might be challenging to predict the correct path to the desired value without a thorough examination.\n\n5. **Typographical Errors**: Mistyping keys or indices can lead to incorrect answers or failure to access the desired data.\n\n6. **Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive. Accidental case mismatch can prevent access to the correct value.\n\n7. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the data type of the accessed value is correct (e.g., string, number, boolean) is important for interpreting the information correctly.\n\n8. **Missing or Null Values**: The JSON file might have missing values or nulls that need to be handled carefully to avoid errors.\n\n9. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is not encoded in a standard format like UTF-8, it may cause issues with parsing or accessing data.\n\n10. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, there might be performance considerations when parsing and searching for the required data.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful inspection of the JSON structure, attention to detail, and possibly some preprocessing or validation might be required."
