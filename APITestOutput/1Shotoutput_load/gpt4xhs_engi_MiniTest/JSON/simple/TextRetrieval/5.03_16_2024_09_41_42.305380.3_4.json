Determining the depth of each object requires a recursive approach or an effective loop mechanism.\n\n2. **Variety of Data Types**: JSON objects can contain a variety of data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays/lists, and other objects). To find the most deeply nested objects, it will be necessary to distinguish between these types and navigate through them accordingly.\n\n3. **Multiple Deeply Nested Objects**: There might be multiple objects at the same maximum depth level. Identifying and extracting all of these without missing any will be required to completely answer the question.\n\n4. **Key-Value Pairs**: JSON objects are key-value pairs. Identifying only the value part that is most deeply nested while ensuring the key is reported alongside it for context might be needed.\n\n5. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, there could be performance considerations when parsing and iterating through the data.\n\n6. **Encoding and Format Consistency**: The JSON file must be properly encoded and formatted. Any inconsistencies or errors in the file might cause issues during parsing.\n\nWhen encountering these challenges, one might have to employ a JSON parsing library or write custom code to handle each case appropriately. It is also important to ensure that the code robustly handles unexpected or malformed JSON content."
