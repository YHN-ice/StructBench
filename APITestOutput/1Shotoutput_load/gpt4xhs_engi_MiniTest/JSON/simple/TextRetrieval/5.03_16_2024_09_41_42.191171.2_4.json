Identifying all of these and ensuring none are missed could be difficult.\n\n3. **Variably Nested Lists or Dictionaries**: The JSON file might contain lists or dictionaries at different levels of nesting. Determining the nesting level of an object that does not contain any further lists or dictionaries would require recursively checking each object.\n\n4. **Similar Keys at Different Levels**: If the JSON has keys with identical names at different levels of nesting, it could cause confusion when trying to determine the depth of each object.\n\n5. **Circular References**: Although not common and generally not recommended, JSON structures could theoretically contain circular references (which would be non-standard for JSON), which would create an infinite loop if not handled properly during parsing.\n\n6. **Performance and Memory Issues**: For very large files, memory usage and performance could be an issue when parsing and holding the structure in memory, potentially complicating the process of finding the most deeply nested objects.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a systematic approach to recursively traverse the JSON structure would be required. The traversal would need to keep track of the current level of depth and compare it with the maximum found so far, updating the list of most deeply nested objects whenever a new \"deepest\" level is encountered.
