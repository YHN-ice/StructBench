Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and values: In JSON, keys and values should be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and unquoted strings can cause errors.\n\n4. Data types mismatch: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Mismatching data types (like using an object where an array is expected) can lead to errors.\n\n5. Nesting errors: Improperly nested objects or arrays can cause structural issues.\n\n6.
