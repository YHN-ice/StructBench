If there's an expectation mismatch (e.g., expecting an object but finding an array), it might require additional handling.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the file has encoding issues, special characters might not be parsed correctly.\n\n8. **Access Permission**: If the parser does not have the proper access permissions to read the JSON file, it will not be able to parse it.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to ensure that we have a valid and accessible JSON file, understand the structure of the JSON data, and have clear instructions on what data needs to be extracted.
