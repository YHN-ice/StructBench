Some potential challenges include:\n\n1. **Nested Objects and Arrays**: If the JSON structure is deeply nested with many levels of objects and arrays, determining the correct path to the desired value can be complex.\n\n2. **Ambiguous Keys**: If the JSON file contains keys with identical names at different levels of nesting, it may be confusing to identify which key to reference.\n\n3. **Dynamic Structure**: If the structure of the JSON file is not fixed, and it changes dynamically, it might be difficult to hardcode the path to a specific value.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues**: JSON supports different data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring that the correct data type is handled at each level of access is crucial.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, loading and parsing the entire file could lead to performance issues and may require efficient parsing techniques or streaming.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: Any syntax errors in the JSON file can cause parsing to fail, so the file must be correctly formatted.\n\n7. **Indexing Arrays**: When dealing with arrays, you need to know the correct index to access the desired element, which could be problematic if the index is not known ahead of time or if it changes.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the file uses a different encoding than expected, there could be issues with reading and parsing the content correctly.\n\n9. **Security Concerns**: When parsing JSON from untrusted sources, there's a risk of security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks if not handled properly.\n\n10. **Platform or Language Limitations**: The capabilities of the parser or limitations of the programming language or platform being used to parse the JSON file might also impact access to nested values.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful analysis of the JSON structure, good error handling, attention to performance considerations, and security best practices should be employed."
