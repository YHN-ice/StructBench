Using the wrong type of access method will result in an error or incorrect data.\n\n4. **Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive. Accidentally altering the case of a key while trying to access its value will lead to a failure in finding the value.\n\n5. **Type Errors**: Data types are important in JSON. For example, trying to access an index on an object or a key on an array as if the opposite were true would lead to errors.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: The syntax for accessing values in a nested JSON structure must be precise. Any missing brackets, parentheses, or quotes can cause errors.\n\n7. **Dynamic Data**: If the JSON data is dynamic and not well known in advance, it might be more challenging to know which keys or indexes are needed to access a particular value.\n\nOnce we have the JSON input, we will need to carefully navigate these potential issues to accurately access the requested value."
