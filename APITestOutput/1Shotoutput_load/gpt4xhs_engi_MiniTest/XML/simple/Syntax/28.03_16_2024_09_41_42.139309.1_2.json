        "True\n\nIn both of the XML inputs provided, there are multiple structural errors. Here are some of the issues:\n\n1. There are several tags that are opened but not properly closed with a corresponding closing tag. For example, in the first XML:\n   - The `<E>` tag is opened but not closed.\n   - The `<H V=\"u\">` tag is opened but not closed.\n   - The `<J U=\"t\">` tag is opened but not closed.\n\n   And similarly, in the second XML:\n   - The `<D>` tag is opened but not closed.\n   - The `<E Y=\"w\">` tag is opened but not closed.\n   - The `<F X=\"v\">` tag is opened but not closed.\n   - The `<G>` tag is opened but not closed.\n\n2. Text nodes are placed improperly outside of tags in places where they should be within tags or properly separated.\n\n3. Inconsistent nesting of elements, where children tags are not closed before the parent tag is closed.\n\nTo fix these errors, every tag that is opened must have a corresponding closing tag (e.g., `<E>` should be closed with `</E>`), and the tags must be properly nested within their parent elements. Text nodes must also be placed within tags or appropriately structured."
