If the tag \"K\" is in a namespace, it must be handled properly by the parser.\n\n3. **Multiple \"K\" Tags**: If there are multiple tags named \"K\" at different levels of the XML tree or with different properties, it needs to be specified which one is being referred to.\n\n4. **Encoding Problems**: The XML file could be in an encoding that does not match the declared encoding or the parser's default, leading to issues with special characters or non-Latin alphabets.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the XML file is very large, memory issues could arise when trying to parse the file, depending on the parser's implementation (DOM vs. SAX).\n\n6. **CDATAs and Entities**: Content within CDATA sections or entities will be parsed differently from regular tag content.\n\n7. **Attributes vs. Text**: Sometimes the content might be in an attribute of tag \"K\" instead of between the opening and closing tags.
