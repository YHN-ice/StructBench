        "Given the input tree structure, the height of the root node 'j' can be calculated by finding the longest path from 'j' to any leaf node. The height is the number of edges in this longest path.\n\nLet's analyze the tree structure:\n\n- `j->k`: One edge starts from 'j'.\n- `k->l`, `k->q`, `k->v`, `k->ab`: 'k' has multiple children, but we are looking for the longest path, so we follow one child at a time.\n- For each child of 'k', they have their own children (e.g., `l->m`, `q->r`, `v->w`, `ab->bb`), and some of these children have further descendants.\n\nConsidering each path from 'j' through one of its grandchildren (like 'l', 'q', 'v', 'ab'), we see that the maximum height is obtained by adding the edges from 'j' to 'k', from 'k' to one of its children, and from that child to one of its children. Since each level adds one edge, we determine the height by counting these levels.\n\nFrom the provided input structure, we observe that there is no further depth beyond the grandchildren of 'j'. Hence, the height of the root node 'j' is 3 edges, corresponding to the path from 'j' to 'k', from 'k' to one of its children (like 'l'), and from that child to one of its children (like 'm').\n\nThe answer is 3."
