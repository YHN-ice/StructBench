        "To determine the depth of node 'mc', you will need to parse the tree structure provided by the input and create a representation that allows you to calculate the depth of any given node. For this type of problem, it is common to use a hash map (dictionary) to represent the parent-child relationships and then traverse this map to find the depth.\n\nLet's assume we have successfully parsed the tree into a dictionary where each key is a node and the corresponding value is its parent.
