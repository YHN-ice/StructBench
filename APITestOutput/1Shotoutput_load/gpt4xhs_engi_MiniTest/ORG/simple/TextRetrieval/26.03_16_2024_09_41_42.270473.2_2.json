It's essential to recognize all possible patterns that might be used to include images, such as links with file extensions commonly associated with image files (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif).\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The image links could be relative or absolute paths. It would be important to extract the filename correctly regardless of the path type.\n\n3. **Embedded Images**: Images can also be embedded in ORG files using base64 encoding or similar methods. Detecting and handling such cases might prove challenging if you are only required to extract file names.\n\n4. **Markup Variations**: ORG mode supports rich text formatting, which may cause variations in how images are included. For example, there might be additional markup or attributes alongside the image link.\n\n5. **Link Text**: Some images might be linked with descriptive text or alt text. Extracting just the filename might require parsing out this additional information.\n\n6. **Comments or Inactive Links**: The ORG file might contain commented-out links or links that are not meant to be parsed as active content, which should be ignored when extracting image filenames.\n\nOnce the ORG file content is provided, I can parse through it, taking these potential difficulties into account, to extract all included image file names."
