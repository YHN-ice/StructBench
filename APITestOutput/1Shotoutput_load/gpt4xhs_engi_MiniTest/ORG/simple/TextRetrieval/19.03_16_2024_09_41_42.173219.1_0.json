We need to handle all variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underlined, or code blocks. We should parse out the bold text without including other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes characters like asterisks can be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting. We must differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Partial Formatting**: If formatting markers are incorrectly applied (e.g., missing an asterisk), it might not be clear whether the text is meant to be bold.\n\n5. **Multiple Bold Sections**: An ORG file can contain multiple bold segments. We need to extract all instances of bold text.\n\n6. **Inline Code or Verbatim**: Bold markers within inline code or verbatim sections should not be treated as formatting.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: Bold text may span across multiple lines, and we have to decide whether to keep the line breaks in the extracted text or convert them into spaces.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we will be able to apply our understanding of these issues to extract the bold texts accurately."
