Besides the standard double square brackets, there might be other ways images are included which I need to be aware of.\n\n2. Relative vs. absolute paths: Images can be included using relative paths or absolute paths. It's important to capture the full path to accurately identify the image files.\n\n3. Multiple image formats: There could be various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.). I need to consider all potential image formats when parsing.\n\n4. Embedded vs. external images: Some images might not be linked but rather embedded directly into the file. Depending on how these are represented in the ORG file, they might require different parsing strategies.\n\n5. Non-image files: There might be other files linked or included in the ORG file. I'll need to differentiate between image files and other types of files.\n\n6. Syntax errors or unconventional formatting: Any deviations from the standard formatting or syntax errors made by the user when including images could make automatic parsing difficult.\n\n7. Large files and performance: If the ORG file is very large with a lot of content, this could impact performance and require more efficient parsing strategies.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help me approach the task more effectively once I see the input file.
