You'll need to know the exact syntax to look for.\n\n2. **Dealing with nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags, such as italic or underline. The parser must correctly identify the bold text without being confused by other formatting.\n\n3. **Handling multiline bold text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must be able to detect and extract it as a single unit rather than separate lines.\n\n4. **Ignoring false positives**: There might be asterisks or similar symbols used in the document for purposes other than bold formatting, such as lists or headings. The parser needs to distinguish between these uses.\n\n5. **Complex documents**: ORG files can contain a lot of complex structures like tables, links, or export blocks. Bold text inside these elements might be harder to parse properly.\n\n6. **Version differences**: There might be differences in how bold text is represented in different versions of ORG file conventions, so the parser should ideally be aware of these variations.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I can proceed to address these challenges where necessary and extract the bold text as required."
