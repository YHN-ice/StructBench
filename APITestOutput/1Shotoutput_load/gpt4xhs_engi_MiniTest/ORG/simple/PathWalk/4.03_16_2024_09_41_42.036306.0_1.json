Clarification is needed to determine the correct subsection.\n\n4. **Large Content Blocks:** If the subsection contains a large block of content, including additional nested subsections or complex formatting (like lists, links, or code blocks), it could complicate the extraction process.\n\n5. **Non-text Content:** The presence of non-text elements, such as tables or images, would need special handling to be represented accurately in text form as part of the excerpt.\n\n6. **Special Characters or Encoding:** Special characters or encoding within the text might not display correctly if the parser is not equipped to handle them.\n\n7. **Metadata or Properties:** ORG files may contain metadata or properties that are not part of the visible content but could affect how the content should be parsed and displayed.\n\nOvercoming these obstacles would typically involve implementing a robust parsing strategy that can handle hierarchical content structures, ensuring proper handling of special characters and non-text elements, and dealing with any ambiguity in terminology."
