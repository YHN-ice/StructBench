We need to know all the possible syntaxes to correctly identify image files.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be included using absolute paths or relative paths. Handling relative paths will require knowledge of the base directory to resolve the full path.\n\n3. **Different Image Formats**: There are numerous image formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), so the parser must be capable of recognizing all the possible image file extensions.\n\n4. **Links vs Actual Image Files**: Some links might point to online resources rather than actual image files within the file system. Distinguishing between these is crucial for accurately listing image files.\n\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images can also be embedded directly in the ORG file as Base64 encoded text. Decoding this and identifying it as an image could be complex.\n\n6. **Comments and Non-Image Links**: Not every link in an ORG file is an image file. Some might be comments or link to other types of files or web pages, so there needs to be a way to filter out non-image links.\n\n7. **Formatting Errors**: If there are formatting errors in the ORG file, such as incomplete or broken links, it might make parsing for images more difficult.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: If multiple images are included on a single line, the parser must be able to handle this and not mistakenly combine them into a single file path.\n\n9. **Encoded or Escaped Characters**: File paths may include encoded or escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\nTo ensure an accurate parsing process, the parser needs to be robust against these potential issues and designed to handle a variety of ORG file structures and contents."
