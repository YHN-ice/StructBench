Clarification on what constitutes \"most deeply nested\" may be needed.\n\n3. Identifying Types: It's important to differentiate between values that are scalars (strings, numbers, etc.) and those that are compound types (lists, dictionaries).

Inconsistent or incorrect indentation can make parsing difficult or lead to errors in understanding the hierarchy.\n\n5. Anchors and References: YAML supports anchors and aliases, which allow for reuse of content.

Multiple Documents: A YAML file can contain multiple documents, each separated by `---`. This means that there may be multiple structures to analyze within the same file.\n\n7. Block Scalars and Flow Collections: YAML has multiple ways to represent multi-line strings (block scalars) and collections (flow collections).
