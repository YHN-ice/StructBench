This appears to be an attempt to define another key-value pair, but the syntax is incorrect. There should be a key followed by a colon (`:`) and then the value.

Similarly, `:d` is also a malformed entry for the same reasons as described above for `:c`.\n\nHere's how the corrected YAML would look without the structural errors:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"p\"\nZ: o\nsubs: \n  - id: \"q\"\n    Y: n\n    subs: \n      - id: \"r\"\n        X: m\n        subs: []\n# Corrected entries for :m and :n, assuming they were meant to be key-value pairs at the same level as 'id'\nm: some_value # Replace 'some_value' with the actual value for 'm'\nn: some_value # Replace 'some_value' with the actual value for 'n'\n```\n\nIt's important to replace `some_value` with actual values if `m` and `n` were intended to be keys in the dictionary.
