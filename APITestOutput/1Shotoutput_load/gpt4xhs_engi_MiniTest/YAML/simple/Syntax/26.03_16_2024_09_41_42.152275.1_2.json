An incorrect number of spaces can lead to an error.\n\n2. **Tab Characters**: YAML does not allow tabs for indentation; they must be spaces. A tab character would be a structural error.\n\n3. **Key-Value Pair Issues**: A common issue is forgetting the colon after a key or having no space after the colon.\n\n4. **Sequences/Formations**: Errors in lists (sequences) or dictionaries (maps) such as missing dashes for list items or improper nesting.\n\n5. **Data Types**: Incorrectly formatted values (e.g., strings not enclosed in quotes where necessary) can cause issues.\n\n6. **Redundant Key Names**: In YAML, keys must be unique within a map. Duplicate keys are an error.\n\n7. **Syntactical Issues**: Using reserved characters incorrectly or misplacing structural indicators like '---' for document start can cause errors.\n\n8. **Comments**: Incorrect usage of the comment indicator '#' (e.g., not putting a space after it) can result in parsing errors.\n\n9. **Complex Structures**: With more complex structures, such as nested maps and sequences, it's easy to make a mistake with the hierarchy and alignment.\n\n10. **Version and Feature Support**: Depending on the version of YAML and the features supported by the parser, certain structures or syntaxes may not be allowed.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I will parse it and identify any structural errors based on these common issues."
