There are colons (`:`) placed after some `subs: []` lines without any associated keys which are not valid in YAML.\n2.

These should either be removed or corrected to represent valid key-value pairs.\n\nIn the second case, if the intention was to include commas as part of the values, they should be enclosed within quotes to ensure they are treated as string literals.\n\nCorrecting these issues should involve removing the erroneous colons and either removing the commas or enclosing the values with commas in quotes if they are intended to be part of the value."
