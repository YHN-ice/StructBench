Here are some of the common issues that can lead to structural errors in a YAML document:\n\n1. Indentation Errors: YAML relies on indentation to define structure, using spaces (typically two or four per level of indentation). Using tabs or inconsistent spacing can cause errors.\n\n2. Incorrect Use of Colons: In YAML, colons are used after keys to separate them from their values. Missing colons or using them incorrectly can cause parsing errors.\n\n3. Improper Handling of Scalars and Collections: Scalars (e.g., strings, numbers) and collections (lists and maps) need to be formatted correctly. Failure to properly quote strings with special characters or not using the correct syntax for lists and maps can result in errors.\n\n4. Dashes in Lists: When defining a list, each item should start with a dash and a space. If the dash is missing, or there's no space after it, the list won't be parsed correctly.\n\n5. Anchors and Aliases Misuse: Anchors and aliases allow for reuse of content in YAML, but if not used correctly, they can cause confusion or errors.\n\n6. Incorrect Multi-line Strings: YAML supports multi-line strings with special characters `|` for literal blocks and `>` for folded blocks. Incorrect usage can result in formatting errors.\n\n7. Compatibility with Different YAML Versions: YAML 1.1, 1.2, etc., have some differences in how they handle certain features. Using features from a different version than the parser expects can cause issues.\n\n8. Duplicate Keys: YAML does not allow for duplicate keys within the same map; having them can lead to undefined behavior or errors.\n\n9. Complex Structures: Nested structures and complex data types might not be parsed correctly if the structure isn't defined clearly.\n\n10. Special Characters in Keys: Special characters in keys may need to be quoted to be parsed correctly.\n\nIf I encounter a YAML file with these issues, I will identify them based on the actual content provided.
