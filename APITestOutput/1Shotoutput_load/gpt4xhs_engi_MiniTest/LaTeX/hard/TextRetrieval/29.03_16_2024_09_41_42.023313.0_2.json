The figures might also be in different directories or subdirectories.\n\n3. **File Extension Omission**: Sometimes in LaTeX, the file extension might be omitted in the `\\includegraphics` command since LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: There could be LaTeX commands that include multiple figures within a single statement, like `\\includegraphics{fig1,fig2}`.\n\n5. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX file might be commented out with `%`, so any `\\includegraphics` commands within comments should not be considered.\n\n6. **Complex File Names**: Filenames might include spaces, underscores, or other characters that could complicate the parsing.\n\n7. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command might include optional arguments before the file name, which should be properly ignored to extract only the file name.\n\n8. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document could define custom commands or environments that internally include graphics.
