The parser needs to handle all possible commands that can be used for including figures.\n\n2. **File Path Variations:** Figure files can be included with relative or absolute paths and can be located in subdirectories. The parser needs to account for these variations in file paths.\n\n3. **File Extensions:** Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension when specifying the figure filename (e.g., `image.png`), and other times they do not (e.g., `image`). The parser needs to handle both cases and understand that without an explicit extension, LaTeX will search for all supported image file types.\n\n4. **Commented Lines:** Lines that are commented out in the LaTeX document should not be considered when extracting figure filenames.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures per Command:** LaTeX allows for multiple figures to be included within a single `\\includegraphics` command, separated by commas in some custom commands defined by the user. The parser must split these filenames correctly.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments:** Users can define their own macros or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics`. Identifying figures included through such custom commands can be challenging without expanding these macros.\n\n7. **Options in Include Commands:** The `\\includegraphics` command might have options specified in square brackets before the filename, which should not be confused with filenames.\n\n8. **Different Environments:** Figures can be included within different environments, like `figure`, `minipage`, `subfigure`, etc. The parser should not assume that all figures are within standard `figure` environments.\n\nTo properly handle these challenges, the parser needs to be quite sophisticated and possibly context-aware, depending on the complexity of the LaTeX document it is analyzing."
