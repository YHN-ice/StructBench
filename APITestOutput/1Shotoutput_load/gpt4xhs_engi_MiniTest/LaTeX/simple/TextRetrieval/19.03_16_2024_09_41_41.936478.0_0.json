Nested Commands: Bold commands might be nested within other formatting commands or within environments, which can make the parsing process more complex.\n\n3. Braces Matching: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to define the scope of commands. A parser needs to correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the complete text that is intended to be bold.\n\n4. Incomplete or Broken Syntax: If the LaTeX file contains syntax errors, such as missing braces or misspelled commands, it may be difficult to accurately extract the bold text.\n\n5. Custom Commands: The document may define custom commands for making text bold, which would not be recognized without additional information about these commands.\n\n6. Comments: Bold text within comments (i.e., after `%` signs) should not be treated as part of the main document's content and therefore should be ignored.\n\nThese are some of the issues that might need to be addressed when parsing a LaTeX file to extract bold texts.
