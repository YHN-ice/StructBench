Each command might be used differently, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold commands could be nested within other formatting commands or environments, making it harder to isolate just the bold text.\n\n3. **Custom Commands**: The LaTeX document could define custom commands that internally use bold formatting, requiring the parser to understand these custom definitions.\n\n4. **Comments**: Bold text could be commented out within the LaTeX source, which means it should not be extracted as it is not intended to be part of the final output.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Whitespaces**: The text within the bold commands might span multiple lines or contain significant whitespace, which needs to be handled appropriately during extraction.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: LaTeX commands can have optional arguments that might precede the actual content. These should not be confused with the content to be extracted.\n\n7. **Environment-based Formatting**: Bold text might also be applied by environments like `\\begin{bfseries}` and `\\end{bfseries}`, which would require environment-based parsing rather than command-based parsing.\n\n8. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands**: In case of errors or incomplete LaTeX code, such as a missing closing brace, the parser must either handle these gracefully or report them as errors.\n\n9. **Package-Specific Commands**: Some LaTeX packages may introduce their own commands for bold text which are not part of standard LaTeX, thus requiring knowledge of those packages to correctly extract bold text.\n\nThese are some of the potential challenges one might face when trying to extract bold text from a LaTeX file.
