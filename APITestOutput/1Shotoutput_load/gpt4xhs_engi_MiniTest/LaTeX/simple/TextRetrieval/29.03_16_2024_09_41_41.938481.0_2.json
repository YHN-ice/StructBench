In LaTeX, the most common command for this purpose is \\includegraphics, which may appear within a figure environment or without it.\n\nSome potential difficulties and obstacles in parsing a LaTeX file for figure filenames could include:\n\n1. Variations in the syntax: The \\includegraphics command can be used with different options and syntax styles, such as with or without optional arguments (e.g., scale, width, height), and the filename itself might be enclosed in curly braces `{}` or not.\n\n2. File path complexities: The path to the figure file might include directories, which need to be properly extracted along with the filename. Additionally, the file extension might be omitted in the LaTeX command, assuming it's in a format that LaTeX can automatically resolve (like .png, .jpg, .eps, .pdf).\n\n3. Comments and line breaks: The LaTeX file might contain comments (using the `%` symbol) that could include text resembling figure inclusion commands but are not actual code. Also, line breaks and indentation might make the parsing process more complex.\n\n4. Multiple figures in one command: Sometimes, LaTeX users include multiple figures side by side using a single \\includegraphics command inside a figure environment with subfigures.\n\n5. Custom commands or environments: The document might define custom commands or environments that internally use \\includegraphics but are not directly visible in the command itself.\n\n6. Conditional compilation: Some figures might be included conditionally using LaTeX if-then-else constructs, which might make it necessary to understand the logical structure of the document to determine whether a figure is actually included.\n\nThese are just a few examples of potential difficulties.
