The most common command for this purpose in LaTeX is `\\includegraphics`, which is often found within a `figure` environment. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Variations of include commands**: Besides `\\includegraphics`, there could be custom commands defined in the preamble or included packages that wrap around the standard image inclusion command, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n2. **Comments**: Some figure inclusions might be commented out using the `%` symbol, which means they're not meant to be processed by LaTeX. Therefore, it's important to distinguish between active commands and those that are commented out.\n\n3. **File paths**: The filenames might include relative or absolute paths, and they might be nested within directories. The parser should be able to extract the full path if necessary.\n\n4. **File extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX file inclusion commands don't specify the file extension, as LaTeX can automatically determine it. The parser might need to account for this and still extract the correct filename.\n\n5. **Options within includegraphics**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have options specified in square brackets before the filename, and the parser must be able to handle and ignore these options to extract only the filename.\n\n6. **Multiple figures in one command**: In some cases, a single `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple files, separated by commas or other delimiters, which should be properly split and parsed.\n\n7. **Environment variations**: Figures might be included inside different environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), and the parser should recognize these contexts.\n\n8. **Complex file names**: Filenames with spaces, special characters, or multiple dots could present challenges in correct extraction.\n\n9. **File name concatenation**: In some complex LaTeX documents, filenames could be constructed using concatenated strings or commands, which may require more advanced parsing logic to resolve.\n\nTo handle these difficulties, the parser may need to implement comprehensive logic considering LaTeX syntax rules, possible command variations, and robust string manipulation capabilities.
