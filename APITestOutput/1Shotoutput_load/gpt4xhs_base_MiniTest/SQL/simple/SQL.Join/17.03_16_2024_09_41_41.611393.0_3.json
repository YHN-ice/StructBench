        "To determine how many people who work in WA are taller than 168, we need to look for records where the location is WA, the person is employed, and the height is greater than 168. \n\nFrom the provided input:\n\n- Person a (r) is male, 16 years old, has a height of 190 cm, and works for Google in CA, so does not meet the location criteria.\n- Person b (s) is female, 19 years old, has a height of 176 cm, and is unemployed, so does not meet the employment criteria.\n- Person c (t) is male, 31 years old, has a height of 142 cm, and is unemployed, so does not meet the employment or height criteria.\n- Person d (u) is female, 64 years old, has a height of 145 cm, and is employed by NVIDIA in WA. However, she does not meet the height criteria.\n- Person e (v) is female, 50 years old, has a height of 194 cm, and is retired, so does not meet the employment criteria.\n- Person f (w) is female, 28 years old, has a height of 136 cm, and works for Google in CA.
