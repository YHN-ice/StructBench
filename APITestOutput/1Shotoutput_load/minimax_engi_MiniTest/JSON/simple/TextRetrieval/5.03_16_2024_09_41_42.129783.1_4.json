Determining the depth of each object and comparing them can be challenging.\n\n2. **Determining terminal nodes:** We need to identify which objects represent terminal nodes in the hierarchy (i.e., they do not contain any further nested lists or dictionaries).\n\n3. **Variability in structure:** Some JSON files might not have a consistent structure, making it difficult to apply a uniform approach to find the most deeply nested objects.\n\n4. **Large file size:** If the JSON file is very large, it could be difficult to process the entire file efficiently within memory and performance constraints.\n\n5. **Ambiguity in definition:** The definition of \"most deeply nested\" could be interpreted in different ways. For example, there might be multiple objects at the same depth, but with differing numbers of ancestors.\n\n6. **Representation format:** The excerpt must be presented exactly as it appears in the JSON file, which may include proper indentation, line breaks, and other formatting details that need to be preserved in order to fulfill the requirement.\n\n7. **Data types and values:** Some values may initially appear as dictionaries or lists, but upon closer inspection might actually be strings representing complex data structures (e.g., JSON strings).\n\nOnce we start parsing the JSON file, we'll need to address these challenges to ensure we correctly identify and extract the most deeply nested objects as required."
