Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. **Nested Structure Complexity**: JSON files can have a complex nested structure with objects within arrays within objects and so on. It can be challenging to keep track of the current depth and determining when an object is the most deeply nested.\n\n2. **Arrays vs. Objects**: The requirement to find the most deeply nested objects that are not lists (arrays) or other dictionaries (objects) means that the parser has to discern between different types of collections and values.\n\n3. **Multiple Deeply Nested Objects**: There may be multiple objects at the same level of maximum depth, so the parser must be able to handle and return all such instances.\n\n4. **Variable Depth Across Branches**: Different branches of the JSON structure might have different depths, so a comprehensive search across all branches is necessary.\n\n5. **Large File Sizes**: If the JSON file is very large, it might present memory and performance issues for parsing, especially if it cannot be processed incrementally.\n\n6. **Data Types**: JSON supports various data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). The parser must correctly handle these types within nested structures.\n\n7. **Recursion vs. Iteration**: Depending on the approach taken (recursion vs. iteration), stack overflow errors or complexity in managing the current state could be a challenge.\n\n8. **Ambiguous Requirements**: The question specifies \"no value of type list or dict\" which may lead to ambiguities if there are mixed-type arrays containing dictionaries or lists alongside primitive types.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, it is important to use a robust method for traversing the JSON structure that correctly identifies and records the level of nesting, handles all data types appropriately, and collects all instances of the most deeply nested objects as required."
