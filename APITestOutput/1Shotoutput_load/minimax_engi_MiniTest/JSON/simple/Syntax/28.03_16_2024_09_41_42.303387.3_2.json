Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Incorrect Braces and Brackets**: JSON structure relies heavily on curly braces `{}` to denote objects and square brackets `[]` to denote arrays. Missing or mismatched braces or brackets can cause errors.\n\n2. **Commas**: JSON requires commas to separate key-value pairs within an object and elements within an array. Missing or extra commas can cause errors.\n\n3. **Quotes**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes, unquoted keys, or unquoted string values are considered errors.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, `true`, `false`, and `null`. Incorrect use of data types may lead to errors.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas**: A common error is a trailing comma after the last key-value pair in an object or the last element in an array. This is not allowed in JSON.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: The file must be properly encoded (usually UTF-8) without any invalid characters that are not permitted in JSON strings.\n\n7. **Nested Structures**: Improperly nested objects or arrays can create structural issues.\n\n8. **Key Uniqueness**: In a JSON object, each key should be unique within that object. Duplicate keys can cause issues depending on the parser.\n\nIf the given JSON file contains any of these issues, it would be considered to have structural errors. Please provide the JSON file so I can check for structural errors."
