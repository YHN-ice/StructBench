Missing or extra commas: Each key-value pair in an object should be separated by a comma, except for the last pair. Similarly, each element in an array should be separated by a comma, except for the last element.\n\n2. Unquoted keys: In JSON, keys must always be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Single quotes: JSON requires double quotes for strings; single quotes are not valid.\n\n4. Trailing commas: Commas following the last key-value pair in an object or the last element in an array are not allowed.\n\n5. Improper nesting: Objects and arrays must be properly opened and closed with curly braces `{}` for objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays.\n\n6. Data types: Values must be of a valid JSON data type: string, number, object, array, true, false, or null.\n\n7. Encoding: JSON should be properly encoded as UTF-8.\n\nIf I am provided with a textual representation of a JSON structure within this format, I can analyze it and point out any structural issues based on these common errors.
