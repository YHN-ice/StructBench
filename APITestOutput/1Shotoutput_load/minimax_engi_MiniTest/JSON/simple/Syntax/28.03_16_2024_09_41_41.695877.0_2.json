Incorrect brackets: JSON uses curly braces `{}` for objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays. Mismatched or misused brackets will result in an error.\n3. Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and string values: In JSON, all keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes `\"`.\n4. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages, JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an object or array.\n5. Data type issues: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). Mixing these up or formatting them incorrectly can lead to errors.\n6. Nested structures not properly closed: When using nested objects or arrays, each must be properly closed within its hierarchy.\n7. Encoding issues: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8, and any deviations might cause problems.\n\nNow, please provide the JSON file content so I can check for any structural errors."
