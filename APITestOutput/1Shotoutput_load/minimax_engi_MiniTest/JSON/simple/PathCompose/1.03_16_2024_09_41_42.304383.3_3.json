Off-by-one errors are common when dealing with indices.\n\n4. **Data type validation**: JSON supports different data types like numbers, strings, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring the expected data type at each level of the structure is important to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Dynamic structure**: If the structure of the JSON is not fixed or known in advance, it might require conditional logic to handle variability in the data format.\n\n6. **Large files**: Large JSON files can be difficult to navigate manually and might require automated tools or scripts to parse efficiently.\n\n7. **Encoding**: Properly handling encoding is critical, especially if the JSON contains special characters or is in a different language.\n\n8. **Error handling**: Proper error handling is required to gracefully manage missing keys, unexpected data types, or malformed JSON.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties can help us approach the problem systematically and ensure that we access the correct value in the JSON file.
