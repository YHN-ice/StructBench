It can be challenging to navigate through various levels to find the specific \"subs\" array and then extract the \"id\" from the first object.\n\n2. **Key Ambiguity**: The term \"subs\" might refer to multiple arrays or objects within the JSON structure, so it's important to ensure we're looking at the correct one.\n\n3. **Incorrect or Incomplete Data**: The JSON file might be incomplete, corrupted, or contain errors that could prevent successful parsing, such as missing commas, brackets, or quotes.\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it might take time to parse and locate the necessary information or could lead to performance issues.\n\n5. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the \"id\" field is present and that it is the correct data type (e.g., string, number) for interpretation.\n\n6. **Array Indexing**: Arrays in JSON are zero-indexed, so the first object would be at index 0. It's necessary to keep this in mind when looking for the first object of \"subs\".\n\n7. **Encoding**: If the file encoding is not standard (e.g., UTF-8), there might be issues with interpreting certain characters.\n\n8. **Access Permission**: Depending on the system setup, there might be access permissions that prevent reading the file.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help in preparing to accurately parse the JSON file and extract the required information.
