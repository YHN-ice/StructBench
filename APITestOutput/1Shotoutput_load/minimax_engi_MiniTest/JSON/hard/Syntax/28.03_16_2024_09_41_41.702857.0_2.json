Single quotes are not valid, and unquoted keys or values can cause errors.\n\n3. Improper use of data types: JSON supports specific data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, null, objects, and arrays. Using an incorrect type for a value can lead to errors.\n\n4. Trailing commas: Some parsers may not accept trailing commas at the end of lists or objects.\n\n5.
