Using an incorrect or unsupported data type would result in an error.\n\n4. Extra characters: Any characters outside of the JSON structure, such as trailing commas or additional text after the closing brace, can result in errors.\n\n5. Encoding issues: JSON should be encoded in UTF-8. If the file uses a different encoding, it might cause parsing issues.\n\n6. Use of comments: Standard JSON does not support comments.
