Heterogeneous structures can be harder to parse and identify the deepest level.\n\n3. **Determining Depth**: It might be complex to programmatically determine what constitutes the \"most deeply nested\" without ambiguity, especially if there are multiple objects at the same depth.\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be difficult to process it efficiently without consuming too much memory or taking too much time.\n\n5. **Data Types**: Identifying whether a value is of type list or dict might not be straightforward if the JSON contains custom data types or if the parser does not correctly interpret the types.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The requirement to provide excerpts exactly as they appear in the JSON file means that formatting must be preserved during processing, which can be non-trivial.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Instructions**: The term \"most deeply nested objects\" could be interpreted in different ways. It might mean:\n    - Objects at the greatest depth regardless of content.\n    - Objects that themselves do not contain any list or dict types, even if they are not at the maximum possible depth.\n\nOvercoming these obstacles would typically involve writing a recursive function to traverse the JSON structure, keeping track of the current depth, and storing excerpts of objects that meet the criteria.
