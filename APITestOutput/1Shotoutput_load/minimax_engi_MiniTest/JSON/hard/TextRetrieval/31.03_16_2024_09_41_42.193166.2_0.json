This could cause parsing errors.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: Characters encoding issues might arise, particularly if the JSON file contains characters outside the standard ASCII range. Ensuring the correct interpretation of these characters is important.\n\n5. **Multiple Objects with Same ID**: If there are multiple objects with the same ID, determining which one to retrieve could be confusing without additional context.\n\n6. **Data Integrity**: The JSON file might contain errors or missing data, leading to incomplete or incorrect parsing results.\n\n7. **Versioning and Updates**: If the structure of the JSON file changes over time (due to updates or versioning), a parser might need to adapt to these changes to locate the requested object correctly.\n\n8. **Performance Optimization**: If efficiency is a concern, optimizing the parsing process to handle large files or complex queries quickly could be a challenge.\n\nOnce the JSON file is provided, I can proceed to parse it and locate the object with ID 'mb' while keeping in mind these potential obstacles."
