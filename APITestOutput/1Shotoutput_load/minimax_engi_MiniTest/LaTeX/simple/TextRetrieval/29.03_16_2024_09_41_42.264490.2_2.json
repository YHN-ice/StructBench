This can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Commented Lines**: Sometimes figure inclusion commands might be commented out with `%`. We need to ensure that we don't extract figures from such lines.\n\n4. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can include options within square brackets before the file path; these need to be correctly parsed to extract only the file path.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes LaTeX allows for multiple figures to be included within a single command, especially within figure environments or with subfigure packages.\n\n6. **Custom Commands or Environments**: A user might define custom commands or environments which include figures, making it harder to identify without understanding the user's macros.\n\n7. **File Name Special Characters**: Some file names may contain special characters that need to be dealt with, like underscores or spaces.\n\n8. **Cross-referenced Files**: Files included from other directories might refer to a common path set by a macro or LaTeX command (e.g., `\\graphicspath`).\n\n9. **Conditional Inclusion**: There might be conditional statements that include figures only when certain conditions are met (e.g., using `\\if` commands).\n\n10. **Environment Nesting**: Figures might be nested within other environments, which can affect how the figure inclusion line is parsed.\n\n11. **File Name Case Sensitivity**: On some filesystems, file names are case-sensitive, which might not be properly handled when extracting and using the file names.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust LaTeX file parser must correctly handle these cases, ensuring accurate extraction of figure file names."
