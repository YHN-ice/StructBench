Identifying all such commands used in the document is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands:** Bold text might be nested within other commands or environments, making it challenging to isolate just the bold part. For instance, `\\textbf{\\textit{Bold and Italic}}` contains both bold and italic text.\n\n3. **Grouping Braces:** LaTeX often uses braces `{}` to group content. There might be cases where braces are used within the argument of `\\textbf{}` for other reasons, such as in `\\textbf{Bold {Text}}`. Parsing should correctly handle such cases.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Code:** LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. Text within comments should not be considered, even if it appears to contain bold commands.\n\n5. **Custom Macros and Commands:** The document may define custom commands that internally use bold commands, which means the parser must be aware of such definitions to correctly extract the bold text.\n\n6. **Line Breaks and White Spaces:** The LaTeX source may have line breaks and white spaces that can make parsing difficult.\n\n7. **Environment-based Formatting:** Bold text could be inside environments that change text formatting, such as `\\begin{theorem}` which may automatically apply bold formatting to some text.\n\nTo accurately extract bold text, the parser must correctly interpret LaTeX syntax and semantics, taking into account these potential challenges."
