The most common command for including graphics in LaTeX is `\\includegraphics`, which is often part of the graphicx package. The command typically looks like this:\n\n```latex\n\\includegraphics[options]{filename}\n```\n\nWhere `filename` can be a local file path or a relative path with or without the file extension. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract all included figure files:\n\n1. **Variations in the command syntax**: Users might include options within the `\\includegraphics` command that could alter the syntax, such as width, height, scale, etc. These options should be ignored when extracting filenames.\n\n2. **File paths and extensions**: LaTeX can include graphics with or without file extensions, and the file paths can be relative or absolute. The parser should be prepared to handle these variations.\n\n3. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes, users might include multiple figures within a single command, for example within a `figure` environment or using subfigures. The parser should be able to recognize and extract each filename individually.\n\n4. **Comments and whitespace**: Comments in LaTeX start with `%` and everything following this character on the same line is ignored. Also, LaTeX is whitespace-insensitive to an extent, so there could be varying amounts of whitespace around commands and filenames that the parser needs to ignore.\n\n5. **Custom commands and environments**: Users might define custom commands or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics`, which could make it harder to extract just by looking for the standard `\\includegraphics` command.\n\n6. **Multiple includegraphics packages**: There are other packages besides graphicx which provide functionality to include graphics (e.g., `graphics` without the 'x'). The parser should account for these as well.\n\n7. **Conditional inclusion**: Some documents might include figures conditionally using LaTeX conditionals or macros. This could make static parsing inaccurate if it doesn't take into account the conditions under which content is included.\n\n8. **Nested files**: The document might include other LaTeX files using commands like `\\input` or `\\include`, where additional figure files could be referenced. These nested files would have to be parsed as well.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will help in writing a parser that can accurately extract all included figure files from the LaTeX document."
