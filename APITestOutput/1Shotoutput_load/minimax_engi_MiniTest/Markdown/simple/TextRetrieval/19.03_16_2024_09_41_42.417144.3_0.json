The most common are double asterisks `**text**` and double underscores `__text__`. We need to ensure that we can handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, links, or strikethroughs. For example, `**bold _italic_**` or `[**bold link**](url)`. It's important to correctly extract just the bold text without the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks and underscores can be escaped with a backslash `\\`, which means they should not be treated as formatting marks. For example, `\\**not bold**` should not be considered bold text.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be used in a context that is not meant for formatting, such as mathematical expressions or as bullet points. For example: `* not actually bold *`.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be cases where the bold formatting is started but not properly closed, leading to ambiguity whether the text should be considered bold or not.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to be able to handle this scenario.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) and inline code (enclosed in backticks `) should not be parsed for formatting, even if they contain what appears to be Markdown formatting characters.\n\n8. **Performance on Large Files**: If the Markdown file is particularly large, the parser needs to be efficient to avoid long processing times.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that could potentially make extracting bold text from a Markdown file complex. Depending on the strictness of the Markdown flavor and the parser's design, there may be additional edge cases to consider."
