We need to recognize all applicable syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements such as italic, strikethrough, or links. Parsing should correctly handle nested elements and still extract the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to display literally instead of as formatting, which shouldn't be confused with formatting markers.\n\n4. **Incorrect Syntax**: Sometimes, markdown might contain syntax errors, like mismatched or unbalanced formatting markers. Deciding how to handle these could be tricky.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, so the parser has to properly concatenate such instances.\n\n6. **Code Blocks**: Text within code blocks or inline code should not be interpreted as formatted text, even if it contains bold syntax markers.\n\n7. **Links and Images**: Bold markers within links or image alt texts should be handled differently since the context might change the interpretation of the text.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the markdown file is large, performance might be a concern, and efficient parsing algorithms would be necessary.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll provide a solution considering these potential issues."
