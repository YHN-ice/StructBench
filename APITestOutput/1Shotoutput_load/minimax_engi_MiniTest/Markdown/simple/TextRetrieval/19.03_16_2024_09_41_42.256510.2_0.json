Different Markdown syntaxes for bold: Markdown can use double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` to denote bold text. It's important to recognize both as indicators of bold formatting.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like links, italics, or strikethroughs. Properly parsing nested elements to extract only the bold text can be challenging.\n\n3. Incomplete or incorrect formatting: In some cases, the Markdown file might contain errors where the bold syntax is not correctly completed (e.g., missing one asterisk), which could lead to incorrect or incomplete extraction of bold text.\n\n4. Escaped characters: Sometimes, Markdown syntax characters might be escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), meaning they should not be treated as formatting but as literal characters. Properly handling escaped characters is necessary.\n\n5. Code blocks and inline code: Text within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or indentation) or inline code (indicated by single backticks `) should not be processed for formatting. Bold syntax within these elements should be ignored.\n\n6. Overlapping formatting: In some cases, there might be overlapping formatting where a piece of text is both bold and italicized or has some other combination of formatting. The parser must correctly identify and extract only the bold portions.\n\n7. Handling different platforms or flavors of Markdown: Some platforms may have their own variations of Markdown that handle bold text differently. It is important to know which version of Markdown is being used.\n\n8. Multiline bold text: Markdown allows for bold text to span multiple lines, so the parser must be able to handle multiline formatted text.\n\nOnce the input file is available, these are the potential issues that I would need to address in order to accurately extract all bold texts."
