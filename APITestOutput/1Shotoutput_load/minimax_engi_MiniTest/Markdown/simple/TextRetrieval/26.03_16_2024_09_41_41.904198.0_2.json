Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Multiple Syntax Formats**: Markdown supports different ways to include images, such as `![Alt text](image.jpg)` and `![Alt text](<image.jpg>)`. An image link can also be referenced elsewhere in the document, like `![Alt text][image_id]`.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative to the location of the Markdown file or absolute URLs pointing to an external resource. Extracting filenames might require handling both types of paths.\n\n3. **Image Titles**: Some images might have titles after the URL, like `![Alt text](image.jpg \"Title\")`, which need to be accounted for when extracting the file names.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: File names can contain spaces and special characters that might be percent-encoded or included within `< >` to indicate special handling.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also embed raw HTML, which might include `<img>` tags with source attributes pointing to images. Parsing these correctly might require additional logic.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: The image syntax could be broken up across multiple lines, especially in the case of reference-style image links, where the URL is provided on a separate line.\n\n7. **False Positives**: There could be text that looks like Markdown image syntax but is not meant to be an image link, such as code examples or descriptions of the syntax itself.\n\n8. **Linked Images**: Sometimes images are also links, so the parser needs to distinguish between the URL of the image and the URL of the link.\n\n9. **Comments**: Markdown doesn't officially support comments, but some variants use `<!-- -->` for comments. Images within comments should not be extracted.\n\n10. **Variants and Extensions**: Different Markdown processors might support extensions with additional syntax for images, so it's important to know which variant is being used.\n\nWhen you provide the input file, I will parse it for image links according to standard Markdown syntax and extract the filenames."
