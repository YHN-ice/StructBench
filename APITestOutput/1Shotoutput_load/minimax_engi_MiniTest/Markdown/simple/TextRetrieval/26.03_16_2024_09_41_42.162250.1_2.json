The most common format is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but there could be variations or shortcuts used in different Markdown dialects.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links may be given with relative paths that make sense within the context of a file system or absolute paths/URLs. Identifying file names might require parsing these paths correctly.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown allows for raw HTML to be embedded within the text. As such, images could also be included using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown's own image syntax.\n\n4. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the text but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, image syntax could be escaped to prevent it from being rendered as an image (for example, `\\![Alt text](URL)`). These should not be counted as images.\n\n6. **Link Definitions**: Some Markdown files define links at the bottom of the document, which could include image URLs that are referenced by shorthand throughout the document.\n\n7. **Non-image File Extensions**: Not all URLs with file extensions are necessarily images. The parser should differentiate between image file formats (like .jpg, .png, .gif) and other file types.\n\n8. **Broken Syntax**: Markdown that is incorrectly formatted might complicate the extraction process as it won't conform to typical parsing rules.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues can help in creating a robust Markdown parsing strategy to accurately extract all included image files. Now, please provide the Markdown file so I can proceed with extracting the image file names."
