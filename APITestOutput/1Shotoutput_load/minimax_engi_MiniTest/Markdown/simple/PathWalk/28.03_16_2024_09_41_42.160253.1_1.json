Identifying the correct level of the requested subsection relative to the sections might be tricky if there are multiple nested levels.\n\n2. **Incomplete Hierarchy**: Sometimes, sections or subsections might not follow a complete hierarchical order. For example, a subsection might not be explicitly marked as such, or headings might not use consistent markdown syntax (e.g., using `#` for top-level sections, `##` for second-level, etc.).\n\n3. **Ambiguity in Headings**: Headings can be denoted using different styles, such as underlined text with dashes or equals signs for top-level headers and hashes (`#`) for others. Consistency in the use of these styles is necessary to correctly identify heading levels.\n\n4. **Variants in Markdown Syntax**: There are slight variations in Markdown syntax between different parsers or flavors (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown vs. CommonMark). The parser needs to handle these variations effectively.\n\n5. **Formatting and Styling**: Markdown allows for bold, italic, code blocks, and other styling elements. These should be preserved in the excerpt while recognizing that they do not denote subsections.\n\n6. **Links and References**: Markdown links and image references can have various formats, and it's important not to confuse reference-style links with headings or subsection identifiers.\n\n7. **List Items**: Lists can sometimes appear as part of a section or as standalone sections. It's necessary to decide whether a list item could be considered as a subsection.\n\n8. **Code Blocks**: Fenced code blocks or indented code blocks must not be confused with section content.\n\n9. **Quotations**: Blockquotes are used for quoting blocks of text and should not be mistaken as section or subsection markers.\n\n10. **Tables**: Tables in markdown are another form where content is structured differently, and it needs to be understood whether they form separate sections or are included within a section/subsection.\n\n11. **Front Matter**: Some markdown files may contain front matter (metadata at the beginning of the file), which should not be confused with actual content sections.\n\n12. **Comments**: Comments in Markdown (which are HTML comments) should not be considered content.\n\nKnowing these potential obstacles, we can proceed more carefully when parsing the Markdown file"
