These would need to be identified separately from the standard Markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Images might be linked with either relative or absolute paths. Distinguishing between the two might be necessary depending on the context of the question.\n\n4. **Presence of URLs instead of File Names:** Sometimes, the image source might be a URL rather than a direct file name, which could require additional parsing to extract just the file name.\n\n5. **Links that Look Like Images:** There can be links that resemble image syntax but are not images (false positives), such as `![](URL)` without an actual image file extension.\n\n6. **Escape Characters:** Some images might include escape characters in their filenames that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on a Single Line:** There could be multiple images included on a single line, and the parser should be able to handle those cases as well.\n\n8. **File Extensions:** Identifying what constitutes an image file extension may vary (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser must recognize all valid image formats.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown Elements:** If the image syntax is nested within other Markdown elements, it might complicate the extraction process.\n\n10. **File Name Characters:** Some filenames may contain spaces or special characters that could affect the parsing if not handled properly. \n\nEach of these potential issues would require careful consideration when writing or using a Markdown parser to make sure that all embedded images are correctly identified and extracted."
