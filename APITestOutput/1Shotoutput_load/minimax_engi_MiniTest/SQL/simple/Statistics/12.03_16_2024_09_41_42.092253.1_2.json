Incomplete or Partial Data: The datatable might be truncated, corrupted, or otherwise incomplete, leading to potential inaccuracies in the count.\n\n6. PrimeKey Usage: If the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we must ensure that we don't count the same individual multiple times if their data spans multiple rows.\n\n7. Case Sensitivity: The data might be case-sensitive, requiring careful handling to ensure 'female', 'Female', and 'FEMALE' are all recognized as the same gender category.\n\n8. Complex Data Structures: If the datatable is in a complex nested format or requires joining multiple tables to ascertain gender, parsing could be more difficult.\n\n9. Language and Cultural Variations: There might be variations in how gender is recorded based on different languages or cultural norms within the dataset.\n\n10.
