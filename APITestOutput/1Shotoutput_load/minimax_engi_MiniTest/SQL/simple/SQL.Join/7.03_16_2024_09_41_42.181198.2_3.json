For example, if some heights are recorded in feet and inches while others are in centimeters, this would require standardization before comparison.\n\n3. **Missing Data**: If there are missing data entries for either the height or the work location, it can make it difficult to determine whether someone should be counted.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Data**: There might be inconsistencies in how the state is labeled (e.g., IL, Illinois, Ill.), which would require normalization of location data.\n\n5. **Data Accuracy**: The data provided might contain errors or inaccuracies which could affect the count.\n\n6. **Filtering Criteria**: Ensuring that the data is filtered correctly for both the height threshold and the state location will be critical. Logical conditions must be applied accurately to avoid incorrect inclusions or exclusions.\n\n7. **Duplicate Records**: If there are duplicate records for individuals (same primeKey), we need to ensure they are counted only once.\n\n8. **Data Types and Comparisons**: Ensuring that numerical data is actually stored or interpreted as numbers (not strings) in order to perform the comparison (> 168).\n\n9. **Performance Issues**: If the dataset is very large, there might be performance concerns with how quickly and efficiently the data can be parsed and analyzed.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, we can address these challenges accordingly to find the number of people working in IL who are taller than 168."
