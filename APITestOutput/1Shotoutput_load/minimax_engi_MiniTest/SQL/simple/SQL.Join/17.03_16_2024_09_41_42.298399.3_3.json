If there are entries with different units (like meters or feet), these would need to be converted to centimeters before comparison.\n\n3. **Missing Data**: There might be missing or incomplete data regarding either height or work location (HI). Rows with missing information in either of these fields cannot be included in the count unless there's a method to fill in the missing data accurately.\n\n4. **Data Errors**: There might be errors or outliers in the data. For example, a height of \"17.8\" could be a typo where \"178\" was intended, or vice versa.\n\n5. **Correctly Identifying 'HI'**: 'HI' should be clearly defined as a work location. We need to make sure we're only considering people whose work location is specifically and correctly labeled as 'HI', and not confusing it with similar abbreviations or codes.\n\n6. **Data Formatting**: The format of the 'work location' and 'height' columns should be understood. For instance, if 'work location' is a code or part of a larger string, we need to accurately parse it to identify 'HI'. Similarly, the height should be a number that we can compare with 178.\n\n7. **Column Identification**: We need to identify which columns correspond to work location and height within the datatable, as they may not be explicitly named or could be among many other columns.\n\nOnce we have addressed these potential difficulties, we can proceed with parsing the datatable to find out the number of people fulfilling the criteria."
