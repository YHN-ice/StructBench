For example, some entries might be missing height information or have heights recorded in different units that need conversion.\n\n2. **Multiple Rows per Person**: If the same `primeKey` indicates the same person, there could be multiple entries for a single individual across the tables. We need to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n3. **Varying Table Formats**: The data regarding location (WA) and height might be in different tables or different columns within the same table. We need to accurately join or cross-reference these pieces of information.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Location Data**: The location data might be inconsistent (e.g., \"Washington\", \"WA\", \"W.A.\" etc.), requiring normalization to ensure accurate identification of individuals working in Washington.\n\n5. **Height Data Presentation**: Height information might be given in different formats (e.g., meters, feet and inches) and would need to be standardized to compare with the 168 cm threshold.\n\n6. **Data Volume**: If the dataset is particularly large, it might be computationally intensive to process, and efficient algorithms or indexing might be necessary.\n\n7. **Textual Ambiguity**: Some entries might contain typos or non-standard abbreviations that could lead to misinterpretation of the data.\n\n8. **Data Privacy and Access**: Depending on the sensitivity of the dataset, there may be privacy concerns or restricted access that could limit the ability to analyze the data.\n\nBy anticipating these difficulties, I can approach the parsing task with a strategy to overcome them and provide an accurate answer to your question.
