Missing Gender Data: If some rows are missing gender information, it could be challenging to count the number of females accurately.\n\n3. Duplicate Records: If the datatable includes duplicate records for the same individuals, care should be taken not to count the same person more than once.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Representations: In some cases, gender might be represented by initials or other ambiguous terms, making it unclear which entries represent females.\n\n5.
