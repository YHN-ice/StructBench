They might be wrapped with different markup syntaxes (like brackets), have preceding characters (like a list item marker), or be embedded within a larger block of text.\n\n3. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images can come in various formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and all possible extensions should be considered when extracting image file names.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links could be absolute URLs or relative paths. Handling both cases may require different approaches.\n\n5. **File Path Complexity**: Some image paths might include directories or subdirectories, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Non-Image Links**: The parser must distinguish between image files and other types of linked files or URLs.\n\n7. **Textual Noise**: There might be text surrounding the image links that do not pertain to the file names, which need to be ignored or filtered out.\n\n8. **Multi-line Links**: In some cases, image links could be broken up across multiple lines, which would require multiline parsing logic.\n\n9. **Duplicated Links**: The same image might be linked multiple times, so there should be a way to handle duplicates if only unique filenames are desired.\n\n10. **Embedded Images**: Images could also be embedded directly in the ORG file in base64 format or similar, which would require a different method of extraction.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll need to account for these potential obstacles to accurately extract the names of all included image files."
