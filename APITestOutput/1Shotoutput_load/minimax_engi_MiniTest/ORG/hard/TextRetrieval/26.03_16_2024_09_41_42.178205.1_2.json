For example, images could be included with links like `[[file:example.jpg]]` or through HTML-style tags.\n\n2. **Variety of image formats**: There might be a variety of image formats included in the ORG file (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), so the parser has to account for all these different extensions.\n\n3. **File paths**: Images could be referenced with relative or absolute file paths, and the parser would need to correctly identify the image file name irrespective of the path given.\n\n4. **Link descriptions**: An image link could include a description that is not part of the file name, such as `[[file:image.png][Description]]`. The parser should extract only the file name and ignore descriptions.\n\n5. **Embedded images**: If images are encoded and embedded directly in the ORG file, it could be more complicated to extract them as file names.\n\n6. **Other non-image files**: The ORG file might include links to other types of files or URLs that are not images. The parser should distinguish between image files and other types of content.\n\n7. **Comments or inactive links**: Sometimes image links could be commented out or made inactive, and depending on the requirements, it may or may not be desirable to include these in the results.\n\n8. **Formatting inconsistencies**: Users may not always follow the exact syntax for including images, leading to potential inconsistencies in formatting that need to be handled gracefully.\n\nTo properly extract all included image files from the ORG file input, the parser will have to address these potential challenges."
