The parser must correctly identify the file names regardless of path format.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: There are multiple image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and the parser needs to recognize all possible image extensions.\n\n4. **Embedded Images**: Images might be embedded within other markup elements, such as links or lists, which may complicate their extraction.\n\n5. **Textual Noise**: There could be non-image text content that includes periods and similar patterns to file names (e.g., \"Figure 1. Example\"), which shouldn't be mistaken for image files.\n\n6. **Link Descriptions**: Some image links might include descriptive texts that need to be ignored in order to extract just the file name.\n\n7. **In-line versus Block**: Images can be included in-line with text or as standalone blocks. The parser must handle both scenarios.\n\n8. **Escaping Characters**: Special characters in the file name or path might be escaped in the ORG markup, and these need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n9. **Formatting Tags**: ORG files can include formatting tags like `#+CAPTION:` or `#+NAME:` that might appear near image links, which should not be confused with actual image files.\n\n10. **Sub-Files and Links**: Some ORG files may include links to other ORG files or external resources which are not images; these should not be extracted as image files.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will help in creating a robust parsing algorithm that can accurately extract image file names from an ORG file. Now, if you provide the ORG file content, I can proceed with extracting the image filenames."
