For example, some might use asterisks (*) for headings, while others might use different symbols or indentation levels.\n\n3. **Metadata and Directives**: ORG files can include metadata (like TODO statuses, tags) and directives (like #+TITLE, #+AUTHOR) that may not be part of the actual content but affect how the content is organized.\n\n4. **Links and Embeds**: ORG files can contain links, images, or even embedded code blocks. Ensuring these are correctly represented in the output might be challenging.\n\n5. **Special Syntax**: Special syntax like lists, checkboxes, tables, etc., need to be handled correctly to maintain the integrity of the information.\n\n6. **Emphasis and Formatting**: Inline formatting for emphasis (bold, italic, underlined text) could be represented with special characters that need to be interpreted or displayed correctly.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help us prepare to parse and extract the necessary information accurately.
