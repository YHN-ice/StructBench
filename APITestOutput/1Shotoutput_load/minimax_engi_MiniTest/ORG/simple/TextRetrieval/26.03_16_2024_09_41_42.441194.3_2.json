Various Image Formats: Images can come in a variety of formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). The parser should be able to identify all common image file extensions.\n\n3. Relative vs. Absolute Paths: Image links may be given with relative or absolute paths. The parser will need to extract the filename regardless of how the path is specified.\n\n4. Inline Images vs. Image Blocks: ORG files may include images inline with text or as separate blocks. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n5. Multi-line Links: Sometimes, an image link might be broken up across multiple lines. The parser needs to account for this possibility and piece together the full link.\n\n6. Commentary or Non-Image Links: The ORG file may contain other links or comment lines that are not images. The parser needs to distinguish between image links and other content.\n\n7. Embedded Attachments: If the ORG file references images as attachments, the parser must be able to resolve these references to actual filenames.\n\nOnce you provide the input ORG file, I’ll proceed with extracting the names of all included image files, taking into account the above potential issues."
