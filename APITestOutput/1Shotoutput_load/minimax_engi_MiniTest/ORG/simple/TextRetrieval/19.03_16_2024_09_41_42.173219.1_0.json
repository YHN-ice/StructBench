Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract bold texts from an ORG file:\n\n1. **Different Markup for Bold**: In ORG files, bold text is typically marked up with asterisks, like `*bold*`. However, there can be variations such as using underscores or other conventions that might not be immediately recognized without proper parsing rules.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold text may occur inline with other text, which could make it difficult to extract without accidentally including non-bold text.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other formatting, such as italic or underlined text, which can complicate the extraction process if the parser does not handle nested formats properly.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: In cases where asterisks are used in the text for purposes other than bold formatting, they might be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), and a parser needs to distinguish these from actual bold markup.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might have applied bold formatting inconsistently across the document, which could lead to irregularities in the markup that are hard to parse.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to be able to handle such cases.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser should be designed to recognize the specific markup used for bold text in ORG files, handle inline and nested formatting correctly, ignore escape characters, cope with inconsistencies, and extract multi-line bold text accurately."
