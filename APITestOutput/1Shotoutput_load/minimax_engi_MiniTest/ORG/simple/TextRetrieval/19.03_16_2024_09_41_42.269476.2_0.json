We would need to decide whether to include or exclude these nested formats in the output.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and we would need to make sure that we capture the entire bold section.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: The ORG file could have inconsistencies in how bold text is formatted, which might make it hard to identify a consistent pattern to extract.\n\n7. **File Size and Complexity**: If the ORG file is very large or includes a complex structure, it might be challenging to parse efficiently.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the ORG file uses a non-standard character encoding, it could cause issues when trying to interpret the characters that denote bold text.\n\nOnce we have the actual input file, we'll be able to address these potential challenges more specifically and figure out how to accurately extract the bold texts."
