In ORG mode, text is typically made bold by wrapping it with asterisks (*). However, there could be several challenges in accurately extracting bold texts:\n\n1. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. Proper parsing would need to deal with such cases without incorrectly interpreting the nested formatting markers.\n\n2. **Asterisks used for other purposes**: Asterisks are also used for creating lists or headings in ORG mode. Distinguishing when an asterisk signifies bold text versus when it is part of a list or heading is necessary.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes asterisks might be escaped to show the literal asterisk character without triggering bold formatting. The parser should recognize and ignore escaped asterisks.\n\n4. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, so the parser should be able to handle multiline formatting and extract the text correctly.\n\n5. **Incorrectly formatted text**: Users might make mistakes in their formatting (e.g., missing an asterisk), which could lead to challenges in accurately determining what is meant to be bold.\n\n6. **Special org-mode properties or syntax**: ORG files can contain special properties and syntax unique to the format which might include asterisks but are not intended to represent bold text.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I can attempt to extract the bold texts taking these potential issues into account, as well as any other idiosyncrasies present in the specific input file."
