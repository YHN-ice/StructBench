Recognizing all these variations can be challenging.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. The parser must correctly handle both to extract the image file names.\n\n3. **Embedded Data URIs**: Some ORG files may embed images directly using Data URI schemes rather than linking to a file. These need to be distinguished from file links.\n\n4. **Non-image File Links**: ORG files can also contain links to non-image files. The parser needs to distinguish these from image files.\n\n5. **Link Formatting**: There may be formatting issues such as broken links, incorrect syntax, or escaped characters that could complicate the parsing process.\n\n6. **Hidden or Commented Links**: The ORG file might contain commented-out lines or sections that include image links which are not supposed to be extracted.\n\n7. **External Links**: Some images might be linked externally (from the web or other external sources) rather than being local files. Deciding whether to include or exclude these based on the task requirements can be a challenge.\n\n8. **File Extensions**: Identifying what constitutes an image file might depend on recognizing file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), which may require maintaining a list of possible image file extensions.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in writing a more robust parser that can accurately extract image file names from an ORG file."
