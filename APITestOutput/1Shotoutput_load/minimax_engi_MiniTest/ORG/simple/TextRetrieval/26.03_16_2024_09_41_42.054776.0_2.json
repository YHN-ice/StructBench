Being prepared to handle different formats is essential.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Images might be included using absolute paths, relative paths, or even URLs. The parser must correctly identify and extract the relevant portions of these paths or URLs.\n\n3. **Inline Images vs. Image Blocks:** Images can be included inline with text or as separate blocks. The parser needs to differentiate between actual image links and other content.\n\n4. **Link Variability:** Sometimes, the link to an image file may not end with a typical image extension (e.g., .jpg, .png) due to URL parameters or being served dynamically from a script.\n\n5. **File Name Extraction:** Assuming that the image links are correctly identified, extracting just the file name from the full path or URL might be needed.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors in the File:** Handwritten or manually edited ORG files might contain syntax errors which could trip up a simple parser.\n\n7. **Variation in Markup Language:** While ORG mode is primarily used with Emacs, variations or custom markup can exist that may not be standard across all ORG files.\n\nBefore proceeding further, it would be helpful to see the actual content of the ORG file to tailor the approach for the specific challenges it presents."
