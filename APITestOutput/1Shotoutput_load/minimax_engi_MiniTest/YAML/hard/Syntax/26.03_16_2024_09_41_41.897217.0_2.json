A common error is incorrect indentation, which can lead to misinterpretation of the hierarchy or structure of the data.\n\n2. **Data Types**: It's important to correctly identify and parse the different data types (scalar, sequence, mapping). For example, a string that looks like a number could be incorrectly parsed if not properly quoted.\n\n3. **Hyphens and Colons**: Hyphens are used for lists, and colons for mappings (key-value pairs). Misplacement of these could corrupt the intended structure.\n\n4. **Complex Structures**: Nested sequences and mappings can be complex to parse and easy to misinterpret if not followed closely.\n\n5. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) to reference other parts of the document, and incorrect usage could lead to errors.\n\n6. **Special Characters**: Special characters need to be handled correctly, especially within strings. For instance, characters like `:` and `-` should be escaped or quoted if they are not meant as syntax symbols.\n\n7. **Tabs vs. Spaces**: YAML does not allow tabs for indentation; only spaces are permitted. A common mistake is using tabs instead of spaces, which can cause errors.\n\n8. **Duplicate Keys**: In a mapping, each key must be unique. Duplicate keys can cause conflicts during parsing.\n\n9. **Document Start and End Indicators**: Multiple documents within a single YAML stream are separated by `---` (start) and `...` (end). Misuse or absence of these indicators could complicate parsing.\n\nBy keeping these potential issues in mind, I can be more alert to common pitfalls while examining the provided YAML input for structural errors."
