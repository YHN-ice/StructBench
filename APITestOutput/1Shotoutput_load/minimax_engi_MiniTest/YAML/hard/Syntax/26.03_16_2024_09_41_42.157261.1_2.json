Tabs are not allowed for indentation.\n\n2. Key-Value Pairs: Each key-value pair must be separated by a colon followed by a space.\n\n3. Lists: Items in a list are usually denoted with a hyphen followed by a space.\n\n4. Scalars and Block Literals: Multiline strings can be tricky and must be handled with block notation (using `|` or `>`) or folded style.\n\n5. Mappings and Sequences: Correct nesting of mappings (objects) and sequences (lists) is crucial.\n\n6. Dashes and Colons in Strings: If a string contains dashes or colons that aren't meant to denote list items or key-value pairs, they should be enclosed in quotes.\n\n7. Anchors and Aliases: The use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) must be correct to avoid referencing errors.\n\n8. Tags and Types: Custom tags or specifying data types should be done correctly.\n\n9. Comments: Comments must start with a `#` and should not interfere with the actual content.\n\n10.
