If used in the file, I would need to correctly resolve these references to understand the data structure.\n\n4. **Data Type Confusion:** YAML is not strictly typed, so values can sometimes be interpreted differently than intended if not explicitly defined (e.g., a string that looks like a number could be incorrectly interpreted as an integer).\n\n5. **Large or Dense Files:** If the YAML file is particularly large or dense, it might take more time to parse and find the relevant information.\n\nPlease provide the YAML input, and I will parse it to answer your question about the first object's 'id' of 'subs'."
