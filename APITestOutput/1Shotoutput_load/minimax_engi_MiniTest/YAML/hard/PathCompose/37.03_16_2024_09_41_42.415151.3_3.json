Mixing these types requires different access methods, and it's important to identify whether to use an index or a key at each level.\n\n3. **Similar Keys**: There may be keys with similar or identical names at different levels of the structure, which can lead to confusion.\n\n4. **Key Names with Special Characters**: Special characters in key names may require special handling or quoting to access correctly.\n\n5. **Type Casting**: Values in YAML are not always strings; they can also be integers, booleans, or even other data structures, so ensuring proper type casting might be necessary for some operations.\n\n6. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports aliases and anchors, which can be used to reference other parts of the document. If not properly understood, this can complicate accessing specific values.\n\n7. **YAML Version**: There are different versions of YAML, and some features may not be supported across all versions.\n\n8. **Whitespaces and Indentation**: YAML relies on indentation to define structure. Inconsistent or incorrect indentation can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the structure.\n\n9. **Language-Specific Quirks**: Depending on the programming language used to parse the YAML file, there might be language-specific quirks in how YAML is interpreted and accessed.\n\n10. **File Size and Complexity**: Large or highly complex YAML files can be difficult to navigate and may require significant processing time or memory to parse.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties allows for better preparation when writing a parser or accessing values within a YAML file.
