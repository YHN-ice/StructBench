Accessing an element in a sequence requires an index, whereas accessing values in a mapping requires a key.\n\n4. **Type Casting**: YAML supports data types like strings, numbers, booleans, etc. Knowing the type of data associated with a key is important, especially when similar keys can have values of different types.\n\n5. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors for reusing common settings. An incorrect reference to an alias could lead to an error.\n\n6. **Special Characters**: Keys or values containing special characters or starting with characters that could be misinterpreted (like hyphens or question marks) could cause issues if not handled properly.\n\n7. **Document Start and End Indicators**: Multiple documents within a single YAML file are separated by `---` for start and `...` for end. It is critical to ensure we are looking at the correct document within a YAML file.\n\n8. **Comments**: YAML supports comments, which start with `#`. These comments should not be mistaken for actual data.\n\n9. **Indentation**: YAML relies heavily on indentation to represent structure. Inconsistent or incorrect indentation can lead to errors in understanding the hierarchy of data.\n\n10. **Version Differences**: YAML has multiple versions (e.g., 1.1, 1.2), and there might be subtle differences in how certain structures are represented or interpreted.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these obstacles will be important in accurately parsing the YAML file and accessing the desired value."
