YAML relies heavily on indentation to denote structure, so any misinterpretation here can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n2. **Complex Structures**: If the YAML file contains nested structures or inherits properties using anchors and aliases, it can be challenging to trace the correct value.\n\n3. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it can be difficult to navigate and locate the specific section or key in question without proper tools or searching capabilities.\n\n4. **Variations in Keys**: Sometimes keys can have similar names or there could be multiple occurrences of a key within different scopes, which may cause confusion about which key-value pair is being referred to.\n\n5. **File Accessibility**: If there is an issue accessing or reading the file content, due to permission issues or file encoding problems, then extracting the required data will be problematic.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Question**: If the question isn't specific enough (e.g., if there are multiple `subs` keys at different levels in the YAML document), determining which `subs` you're referring to might require clarification.\n\nPlease provide the YAML file or its content so that I can assist you with your query."
