Improper Key-Value Separation - Keys and values must be separated by a colon followed by a space.\n4. Duplicated Keys - In a map, keys must be unique.\n5. Syntax Issues - Incorrect use of quotes, special characters without escaping, or missing indicators for complex data types (like arrays or nested objects).\n6.
