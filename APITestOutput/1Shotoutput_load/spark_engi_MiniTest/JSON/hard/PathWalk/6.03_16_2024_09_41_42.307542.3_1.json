Large files can also make manual inspection tedious and increase the chances of overlooking the correct information.\n\n4. **Data Integrity and Formatting**: If the JSON data is poorly formatted or has errors, it might not be possible to parse it correctly. Missing commas, brackets, or quotation marks can lead to parsing errors.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains characters that are not properly encoded, it might be difficult to read or interpret the data correctly.\n\n6. **Variability in Data Types**: JSON supports various data types, such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring that data is interpreted with the correct type is important for accurate processing.\n\n7. **Version and Specification Compliance**: There might be differences in how JSON files are structured based on the version of JSON specification they comply with.
