        "To extract all included figure files from the given file, you need to search for the \\includegraphics command, which denotes the inclusion of image files in LaTeX documents. Each instance of this command is followed by a file name within curly braces.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Read through the entire file content.\n2. Search for instances of the \\includegraphics command.\n3. Extract the string between the curly braces { } that immediately follow this command. This string represents the file name of the included image.\n4. Collect all extracted file names and print them out, each separated by a newline character (\\n).\n\nBy following these steps on the given file content, you would identify these instances of the \\includegraphics command:\n\n- \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{xi.jpeg}\n- \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{yi.jpeg}\n- \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{zi.jpeg}\n- \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{aj.png}\n- \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{bj.png}\n- \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{cj.gif}\n- \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{dj.png}\n\nExtracting the filenames, we get:\n\nxi.jpeg\nyi.jpeg\nzi.jpeg\naj.png\nbj.png\ncj.gif\ndj.png\n\nFinally, printing these filenames separated by a newline character, we have the answer:\n\nxi.jpeg\nyi.jpeg\nzi.jpeg\naj.png\nbj.png\ncj.gif\ndj.png\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there may be a discrepancy between the answer provided in your original input and the actual content of the file.
