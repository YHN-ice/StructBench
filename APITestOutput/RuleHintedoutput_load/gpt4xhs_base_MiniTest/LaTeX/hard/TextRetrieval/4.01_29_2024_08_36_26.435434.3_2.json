        "To extract all included figure files from the provided text, look for the instances of the `\\includegraphics` command, which is used in LaTeX to include images. Each instance of this command is followed by a set of curly braces `{}` containing the file path or name of the image. The question asks to print the file names separated by a newline (`\\n`).\n\nHere are the steps to extract the file names:\n\n1. Search through the text for each occurrence of `\\includegraphics`.\n2. Extract the text within the curly braces `{}` that immediately follows the `\\includegraphics` command.\n3. Print each extracted file name, ensuring each is separated by a newline (`\\n`).\n\nThe extracted file names from the provided text are as follows:\n\n```\nkj.gif\nlj.png\nmj.jpg\nnj.gif\noj.jpg\npj.gif\nqj.gif\nrj.gif\n```\n\nThe answer should be printed with each file name on a new line, like so:\n\n```\nkj.gif\nlj.png\nmj.jpg\nnj.gif\noj.jpg\npj.gif\nqj.gif\nrj.gif\n```\n\nPlease note that the order of the file names as they appear in the text may be different from the order in which they are listed in the question's answer section. The provided answer has them listed alphabetically, but if you're extracting them directly from the text, they should be listed in the order they are found within the file's content."
