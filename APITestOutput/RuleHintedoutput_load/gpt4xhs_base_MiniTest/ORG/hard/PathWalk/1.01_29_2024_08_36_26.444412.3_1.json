In this case, the file seems to use an org-mode-like format, which is a plain text markup language used within Emacs.\n\n- A single asterisk (*) signifies a top-level section.\n- Two asterisks (**) signify a subsection of the preceding section.\n- Three asterisks (***) signify a subsubsection of the preceding subsection.\n\nThe question asks for the content of the \"1th subsubsection under the 1th subsection under the 1th section.\" Therefore, we would identify the first section by looking for a line starting with a single asterisk.

Lastly, we look for the first subsubsection under that subsection by finding the line starting with three asterisks.\n\nBased on the provided text, here is how the structure looks:\n\n* q (1st section)\n** r (1st subsection of section 'q')\n*** s (1st subsubsection of subsection 'r')\n\nSo, to answer the question, we extract the content that includes the heading line and any sub-section from \"*** s\" until before the next \"***\":\n\n```\n*** s\nessence groot ravish qualify kangaroo unique salvage ravish vigor qualify unique*apple banana* ravish cafe essence banana X-ray zen X-ray zen transformer\n```\n\nThis is the content of the \"1th subsubsection under 1th subsection under 1th section\" as it appears in the file."
