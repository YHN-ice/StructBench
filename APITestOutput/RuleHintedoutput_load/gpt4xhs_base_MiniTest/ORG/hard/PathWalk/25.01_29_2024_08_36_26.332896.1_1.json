        "To answer the given question, we need to locate the 1st subsubsection under the 1st subsection under the 2nd section in the provided file. The file appears to be structured in an outline format similar to Emacs Org mode, where asterisks (*) are used to denote sections (with the number of asterisks indicating the level of the section or subsection).\n\nHere is how we can locate the required content step by step:\n\n1. Identify the 2nd section: This is denoted by a single asterisk (*) followed by a space and then the section title. We search for the second occurrence of this pattern.\n\n2. In the 2nd section, identify the 1st subsection: This is denoted by two asterisks (**) followed by a space and then the subsection title, and it should be located under the 2nd section we found in step 1.\n\n3. In the 1st subsection under the 2nd section, identify the 1st subsubsection: This is denoted by three asterisks (***) followed by a space and then the subsubsection title, and it should be located under the 1st subsection we found in step 2.\n\nNow let's locate these in the provided file content:\n\n1. The 2nd section is indicated by the first instance of a single asterisk, which is here:\n```\n* i\n```\n\n2. The 1st subsection under the 2nd section is indicated by the first instance of two asterisks following 'i', which is here:\n```\n** j\n```\n\n3. The 1st subsubsection under the 1st subsection under the 2nd section is indicated by three asterisks following 'j', which is here:\n```\n*** k\n```\n\nHowever, 'k' is not the correct answer. The first subsubsection under subsection 'j' is labeled with '***' and a letter. Since 'k' is not under 'j', we need to continue scanning until we find a subsubsection that correctly nests within our target structure.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n```\n*** r\nwake ravish kangaroo jargon apple cafe zen halo lamb cafe cafe unique halo halo*ravish* apple apple vigor salvage ravish kangaroo\n```\nThis entry correctly follows '** j' as it is indented one level deeper, meaning it is a subsubsection of subsection 'j', which in turn is a subsection of section 'i"
