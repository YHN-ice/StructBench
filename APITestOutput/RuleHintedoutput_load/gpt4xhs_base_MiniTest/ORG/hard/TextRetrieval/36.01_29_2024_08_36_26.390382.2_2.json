        "To extract all included image files from the given file, you need to look for strings that match the pattern of image file names enclosed in double square brackets. The image file names typically have extensions such as .png, .gif, .jpg, or .jpeg.\n\nHere is a step-by-step approach on how this can be done manually:\n\n1. Scan through the file line by line.\n2. Look for patterns that match the format `[[filename.extension]]`, where `filename` is the name of the image file and `extension` is its file extension.\n3. Extract the text within the double square brackets—this is the image file name.\n4. Print each file name on a separate line by separating them with `\\n`.\n\nUsing this approach, you can identify the image files included in the given file:\n\n- `[[jh.png]]` (from the line with \"banana lam[[jh.png]]b perish\")\n- `[[kh.gif]]` (from the line with \"dentist lamb perish .. qualify transformer wake apple transformer yogurt ravish z[[kh.gif]]en unique\")\n- `[[lh.jpg]]` (from the line with \"far lamb perish ... qualify transformer wake apple transformer yogurt ravish z[[lh.jpg]]en unique\")\n- `[[mh.jpeg]]` (from the line with \"jargon lamb perish ... wake apple transformer yogurt ravish zen un[[mh.jpeg]]ique\")\n- `[[nh.gif]]` (from the line with \"monkey lamb perish ... transformer wake apple tra[[nh.gif]]nsformer yogurt ravish zen unique\")\n- `[[oh.png]]` (from the line with \"nob lamb perish ... transformer wake apple trans[[oh.png]]former yogurt ravish zen unique\")\n- `[[ph.png]]` (from the line with \"oops lamb perish ... transformer wake*lamb* apple transformer yogurt ravish zen u[[ph.png]]nique\")\n\nWhen you put all these file names on separate lines as per the given instructions, you get:\n\noh.png\nph.png\nnh.gif\nkh.gif\nmh.jpeg\njh.png\nlh.jpg\n\nThis list matches the Answer section of the provided input."
