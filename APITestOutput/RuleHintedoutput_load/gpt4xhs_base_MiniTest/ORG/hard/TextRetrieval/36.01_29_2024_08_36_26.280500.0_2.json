        "To extract all included image files from the provided file, you need to look for patterns that signify image files. In this case, image files are embedded within double square brackets `[[ ]]` and have typical image file extensions such as .jpg, .jpeg, .png, or .gif.\n\nHere's how you can extract the image file names:\n\n1. Scan through each line of the 'File' section to find lines that contain `[[ ]]`.\n2. Extract the substring that's within the `[[ ]]`, which should represent the image file names.\n3. Print out each of the extracted file names separated by a newline character `\\n`.\n\nFollowing these steps, the output would be:\n\n```\nug.png\nvg.gif\nwg.gif\nxg.png\nyg.jpg\nzg.jpeg\nah.png\nbh.jpg\n```\n\nThe given answer does not match exactly with these steps because it should only include the filenames that are within double square brackets `[[ ]]`. Double-checking the provided 'File' content and correcting the process, we get the correct list of included image files as shown above."
