        "To extract all included image files from the given file input, you'll want to look for patterns that indicate an image file. In this case, image files are included within double square brackets `[[` and `]]`. The image file names also have typical image file extensions such as `.jpeg` or `.png`.\n\nHere's a step by step explanation of how to extract the image file names:\n\n1. Scan through the text line by line.\n2. For each line, look for the pattern that includes double square brackets.\n3. Extract the text within the double square brackets; this will be the image file name.\n4. Print out each file name separated by a newline character `\\n`.\n\nGiven the provided text in the file, you would extract the names as follows:\n\n- First image: `[[pe.jpeg]]` -> `pe.jpeg`\n- Second image: `[[qe.png]]` -> `qe.png`\n- Third image: `[[re.jpeg]]` -> `re.jpeg`\n\nTherefore, your final output, with each file name separated by `\\n`, would be:\n\n```\npe.jpeg\nqe.png\nre.jpeg\n```"
