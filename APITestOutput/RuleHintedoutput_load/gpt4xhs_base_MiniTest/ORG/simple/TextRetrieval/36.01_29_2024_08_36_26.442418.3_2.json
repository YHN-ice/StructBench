In the given file snippet, image files are included within double square brackets `[[ ]]`. So, you would need to search through the file content for all occurrences of text that is enclosed in double square brackets. Once found, you would extract just the file names (without the brackets) and print them each on a new line `\\n`.\n\nHere is the process step by step:\n\n1. Examine the file content line by line.\n2. Look for the pattern `[[image_file_name]]` in each line.\n3. Extract `image_file_name` from within the double square brackets.\n4. Print each extracted file name on a new line.\n\nFrom the provided file content, we see two image files included:\n\n- `[[ij.png]]`\n- `[[jj.png]]`\n\nSo, extracting the filenames and printing them separated by a newline character `\\n`, we get:\n\n```\njj.png\nij.png\n```\n\nThe order of the filenames in the answer matches their appearance within your provided file content, where `[[jj.png]]` appears after `[[ij.png]]`."
