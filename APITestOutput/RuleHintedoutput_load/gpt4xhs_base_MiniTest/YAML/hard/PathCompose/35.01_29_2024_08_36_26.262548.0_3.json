        "To access the value \"ry\" from the given file, you need to traverse the structure provided in the input file. The structure seems to be a nested object/dictionary (`obj`) with lists of objects under each \"subs\" key. \n\nStart from the root object `obj`, then access its \"subs\" key, which contains a list. You need to find the correct index within this list that contains an object with the id \"f\" since that is the parent object directly above the one containing \"P\": ry.\n\nFollowing the hierarchy in the file, you need to:\n\n1. Access the first \"subs\" key in `obj`.\n2. Access the first element of that list (which has an id \"b\").\n3. Within that element, access the second \"subs\" key (since lists are zero-indexed, this is index 1).\n4. Access the first element of that list (which has an id \"f\").\n5.
