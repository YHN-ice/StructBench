        "To access the value \"i\" from the given file with its special format, you would need to navigate through the nested objects and arrays using their keys and indices.\n\nThe structure of the file is similar to YAML, where objects are represented by keys and values, and lists are represented with a dash (-) indicating array elements. \n\nBased on the structure provided, we can see that \"i\" is the value of the key \"Y\" which belongs to the first element (index 0) of the array under the key \"subs\" of the root object (`obj`). Below is how you would access it:\n\n```yaml\nobj: # Root object\n  id: \"a\"\n  Z: j,\n  subs: # Array under \"subs\" key\n    - id: \"b\" # First element of \"subs\" array (index 0)\n      Y: i, # Key \"Y\" with value \"i\"\n      ...\n```\n\nSo, the answer to access the value \"i\" would be:\n\n`obj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]`"
