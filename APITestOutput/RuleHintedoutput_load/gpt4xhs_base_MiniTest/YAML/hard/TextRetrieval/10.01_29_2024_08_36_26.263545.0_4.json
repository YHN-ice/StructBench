        "To get the answer from the provided YAML content, you need to look for objects (in this case, YAML mappings) that do not have any nested list or dictionary as values within them. The `subs` key in the structure indicates potential nesting, with each `subs` containing a list of nested objects. The most deeply nested objects will be those with an empty `subs` list.\n\nFrom the input file structure given, we can see that it's a tree-like structure with each `id` having potential further nested `subs`. The most deeply nested objects are those at the bottom of this tree, where their `subs` list is empty (`subs: []`). These objects, as they appear in the YAML file, are:\n\n```\nid: \"d\"\n  V: xy,\n  U: wy,\n  subs: []\n\nid: \"e\"\n  T: vy,\n  S: uy,\n  subs: []\n\nid: \"g\"\n  P: ry,\n  O: qy,\n  subs: []\n\nid: \"h\"\n  N: py,\n  M: oy,\n  subs: []\n\nid: \"k\"\n  H: jy,\n  G: iy,\n  subs: []\n\nid: \"l\"\n  F: hy,\n  subs: []\n\nid: \"n\"\n  D: fy,\n  subs: []\n\nid: \"o\"\n  C: ey,\n  subs: []\n```\n\nThe answer should consist of these excerpts, separated by two newlines (`\\n\\n`).
