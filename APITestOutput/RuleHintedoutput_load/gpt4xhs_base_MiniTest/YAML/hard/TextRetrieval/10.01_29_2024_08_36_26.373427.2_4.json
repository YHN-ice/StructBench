        "To answer the given question, you need to examine the YAML file content and identify the most deeply nested objects that don't have any further list or dict values within them. You can tell an object is deeply nested when it doesn't have any 'subs' or when the 'subs' array is empty, as indicated by `subs: []`.\n\nIn the provided file, you are looking for objects that have an 'id', some other attributes, and an empty 'subs' list. These objects represent the deepest level in the hierarchy because they do not contain any other nested objects.\n\nHere are the most deeply nested objects from the file based on this criterion:\n\n```\nid: \"r\"\nU: e,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"s\"\nT: d,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"u\"\nQ: a,\nP: zy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"v\"\nO: yy,\nN: xy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"y\"\nK: uy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"z\"\nJ: ty,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"bb\"\nH: ry,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"cb\"\nG: qy,\nF: py,\nsubs: []\n```\n\nEach of these objects features an 'id', one or more additional attributes, and an empty 'subs' array, indicating they are the terminal nodes in their respective branches.\n\nThe answer, formatted as requested with each object excerpt separated by `\\n\\n`, is as follows:\n\n```\nid: \"r\"\nU: e,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"s\"\nT: d,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"u\"\nQ: a,\nP: zy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"v\"\nO: yy,\nN: xy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"y\"\nK: uy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"z\"\nJ: ty,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"bb\"\nH: ry,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"cb\"\nG: qy,\nF: py,\nsubs: []\n```"
