        "To get the answer from the provided file, you need to search for the object with the specific \"id\" value of \"c\" within the file's structured content. The file content resembles a YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) format, which is known for its use in configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to find the object with id \"c\":\n\n1. Begin at the root level of the file where the top-level \"id\" is \"a\".\n2. Notice that the YAML content has a hierarchical structure, indicated by the nested \"subs\" lists.\n3. Traverse down the hierarchy by following each \"subs\" list until you find an object with an \"id\" of \"c\".\n4. Once you find the object with \"id\" \"c\", copy its content as it appears in the YAML file.\n\nFollowing these steps in the provided file, the object with \"id\" \"c\" appears as follows:\n\n```\n- id: \"c\"\n  W: yy,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"d\"\n    V: xy,\n    U: wy,\n    subs: []\n  - id: \"e\"\n    T: vy,\n    S: uy,\n    subs: []\n```\n\nThis excerpt includes the object itself along with its direct children objects (\"d\" and \"e\"), since they are nested within the structure indicated by \"subs\". It is important to retain the original indentation and structure of the YAML content to accurately represent the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer, copied directly as it appears in the YAML file, is:\n\n```\nid: \"c\"\nW: yy,\nsubs: \n- id: \"d\"\n  V: xy,\n  U: wy,\n  subs: []\n- id: \"e\"\n  T: vy,\n  S: uy,\n  subs: []\n```"
