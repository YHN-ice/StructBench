In YAML, lists are often denoted by a hyphen `-`, and key-value pairs are separated by a colon `:`.\n\nLet's break down the file content:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"f\"\nZ: n,\nsubs: \n- id: \"g\"\n  Y: m,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"h\"\n    X: l,\n    subs: []\n```\n\nBased on the given structure, the `subs` key represents a list of objects.

This item is an object, which has its own key-value pair where `id` is the key.\n\nIn this specific case, the first object within the `subs` array has an `id` value of `\"g\"`.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"What is the first object's id of subs?\" is `g`."
