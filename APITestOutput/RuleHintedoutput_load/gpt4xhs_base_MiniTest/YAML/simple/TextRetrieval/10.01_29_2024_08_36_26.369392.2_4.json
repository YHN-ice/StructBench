        "To determine the most deeply nested objects that do not contain a list or dictionary as a value, we need to analyze the YAML structure provided in the file content. In YAML, indentation is used to denote nested structures, and the '-' character is used to denote list items.\n\nHere's how you can interpret the YAML content:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"f\"\nZ: n,\nsubs: \n  - id: \"g\"\n    Y: m,\n    subs: \n      - id: \"h\"\n        X: l,\n        subs: []\n```\n\nIn this structure, `id: \"f\"` is the root object which has a list `subs` containing another object `id: \"g\"`. This object, in turn, has its own `subs` list containing `id: \"h\"`.\n\nThe most deeply nested object within this structure that does not have a value of type list or dictionary is `id: \"h\"`. The key `subs` in the object with `id: \"h\"` has an empty list as its value, which we were told to disregard since we're looking for objects with no list or dictionary values.\n\nTherefore, the answer excerpted directly from the YAML file (and separated by \\n\\n as requested in the question) is:\n\n```\nid: \"h\"\nX: l,\nsubs: []\n```\n\nPlease note that the comma after \"l\" in `X: l,` is kept as it appears in the original file content provided, assuming that it's a part of the syntax specific to this file even though it's not standard for YAML. If this was an error and commas are not needed, then it should be removed to conform with typical YAML syntax."
