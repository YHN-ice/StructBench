The YAML file format is hierarchical, which means items are structured in a tree-like format, where indentations and dashes (-) indicate the nesting of elements.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to find the specified content:\n\n1. Start by locating the root element of the file, which in this case is an object with the id \"f\".\n2. Look at the `subs` list under the root object to find any nested objects.\n3. In the first level of `subs`, there is an object with id \"g\".\n4. Look inside the `subs` list of object \"g\" to find further nested objects.\n5. Within this list, you'll find the object with id \"h\".\n6. Finally, extract the content related to object \"h\" as it appears in the file.\n\nResult:\n```yaml\nid: \"h\"\nX: l,\nsubs: []\n```\n\nThis is the relevant excerpt from the YAML file that represents the object with id \"h\".
