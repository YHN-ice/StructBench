        "To get the answer from the provided input, you need to examine the hierarchy of objects represented in YAML format, and identify the ones that are the most deeply nested and do not contain any further list or dictionary (i.e., no `subs` containing other objects).\n\nFrom the given input, the structure can be visualized as follows:\n\n```\nid: \"b\"\nZ: w,\nsubs:\n  - id: \"c\"\n    Y: v,\n    subs:\n      - id: \"d\"\n        X: u,\n        subs: []\n```\n\nHere, `id: \"b\"` is the top-level object, which contains `subs` that further contains another object `id: \"c\"`. The object `id: \"c\"` is also a dictionary that further contains `subs` with another object `id: \"d\"`. This nested object `id: \"d\"` has no further `subs` and hence is the most deeply nested object without any lists or dictionaries inside it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the excerpt of this most deeply nested object as it appears in the YAML file:\n\n```\nid: \"d\"\nX: u,\nsubs: []\n```\n\nNote that each excerpt is separated by `\\n\\n` as per the question's instruction. However, since there is only one most deeply nested object in this case, there is no need for separation. If there were multiple such objects, each would be separated by a double newline character."
