        "To answer the question, we need to determine the height of the root node in the given tree. The height of a node in a tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf node. A leaf node has a height of 0 since there are no edges below it.\n\nThe file provided is a representation of a tree using an edge list format where each line describes a parent-child relationship in the format `parent->child`. To find the height of the root node, we first need to construct the tree from the given edge list and then traverse it to find the longest path from the root to any leaf.\n\nThe process can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Parse the file and create a tree structure in memory.\n2. Identify the root node (the node that never appears as a child).\n3. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the root to find the maximum depth.\n\nGiven that we have to provide an answer directly without coding, we can run through the process conceptually:\n\n1. Start with the first edge `x->y`. Node `x` is a parent, and it appears at the beginning of our edge list. Unless we find it as a child in other lines, we can assume it's the root.\n2. Read through the list and track the longest path by following the children chains. For example, `x->y`, `y->z`, `z->ab`, and so on.\n3. Verify that `x` is not listed as a child anywhere else in the list; otherwise, it's not the root.\n4. Identify the longest chain of nodes from `x` (or determined root) down to any leaf node (nodes that do not have children).\n\nBy manually inspecting the file or using an algorithm, you should be able to follow the longest path from `x` downwards, counting the number of edges until you reach a leaf node. The number of edges will be equal to the height of the root node.\n\nThe input answer states that this number is `7`, which means that in this tree, starting from node `x`, there exists a path with `7` edges leading down to some leaf node, and there is no longer path from `x` to any other leaf node in the tree."
