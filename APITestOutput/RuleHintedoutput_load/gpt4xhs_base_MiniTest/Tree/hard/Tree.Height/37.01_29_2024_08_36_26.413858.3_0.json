        "To find the height of the root node in this specially formatted file, which represents a tree, we first need to understand the structure of the formatting. Each line in the file represents an edge in the tree, with the format `parent->child`. The height of a node in a tree is defined as the number of edges in the longest path from that node down to a leaf node. A leaf node is a node without any children, so its height is 0.\n\nTo find the height of the root node (in this case, denoted by \"z\"), you would need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Create a representation of the tree**: You can represent the tree as an adjacency list or a dictionary where each key is a node and the corresponding value is a list of child nodes.\n\n2. **Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Start at the root node and recursively visit each node, keeping track of the maximum depth reached. As you visit each node, calculate the height by considering the heights of its child nodes.\n\n3. **Calculate the height**: The height of a non-leaf node is one more than the maximum height of its children.\n\nFor this specific task, you don't need to implement an actual algorithm but rather visualize or simulate it since you're given the path from root to leaves directly in sequential order. Looking at the input file, the given path from the root \"z\" to a leaf can be followed, with each line representing one level deeper in the tree:\n\n```\nz->ab\nab->bb\nbb->cb\ncb->db\ndb->eb\neb->fb\nfb->gb\n```\n\nFollowing this path, we count 7 edges, which means that the height of the root node \"z\" is indeed 7, as given in the answer."
