        "The file provided seems to represent a directed graph using an edge list format, where each line represents a directed edge from one node to another (for example, \"v->w\" indicates an edge from node \"v\" to node \"w\"). The question asks for the height of the root node, which is the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node, where a leaf node is a node with no outgoing edges (a terminal node in the graph).\n\nTo determine the height of the root node, you would need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the root node(s): The root node(s) are the nodes that have no incoming edges. In this file format, that would be any node on the left-hand side of \"->\" that does not appear on the right-hand side of \"->\" anywhere in the file.\n\n2. Construct a representation of the graph: You could use a data structure such as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix to represent the graph. This would let you systematically explore the graph to calculate path lengths.\n\n3. Calculate path lengths: Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the root node to calculate the length of each path to all reachable leaf nodes.\n\n4. Find the longest path: Determine which path is the longest by comparing the lengths of all paths found. The length of this path will give you the height of the root node.\n\nHowever, since we cannot execute these steps directly here, we need to manually inspect the file to determine the height of the root node. To do this, look for the longest sequence of \"->\" that starts with a node that is not a target of any other node (a potential root) and ends with a node that does not have any outgoing edges (a leaf).\n\nGiven that the longest sequence in the file appears to be:\n\n```plaintext\nv->w->x->y->z->ab->bb->cb\n```\n\nThis sequence contains 7 edges from \"v\" to \"cb,\" which suggests that \"v\" is likely to be the root and \"cb\" is a leaf at maximum depth. Therefore, based on manual inspection, the height of the root node \"v\" is 7, as given in the answer."
