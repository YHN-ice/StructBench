        "The question asks for the path from the root node to the node \"wd\" in a tree represented by a file with particular syntax. The syntax in the file indicates parent-child relationships, where each line represents an edge from a parent node to a child node in a directed tree, formatted as \"parent->child\".\n\nTo find the path from the root node to \"wd\", we need to trace back from \"wd\" to the root node by finding a sequence of parent-child relationships that lead back to the root. In this case, the root node is \"x\" because it's the starting point with no parents mentioned in the file.\n\nHere's how we can find the path:\n\n1. Look for the line that contains \"->wd\", this is the child node we want to reach.\n2. Find its parent node, which is \"vd\" (from line \"vd->wd\").\n3. Repeat step 1 and 2 for the parent node (\"vd\") to find its parent, which is \"ud\".\n4. Continue this process until you reach the root node (\"x\"), always moving from child to parent.\n\nFollowing this process:\n\n- \"vd->wd\": Parent is \"vd\".\n- \"ud->vd\": Parent is \"ud\".\n- \"md->ud\": Parent is \"md\".\n- \"ld->md\": Parent is \"ld\".\n- \"kd->ld\": Parent is \"kd\".\n- \"y->kd\": Parent is \"y\".\n- \"x->y\": Parent is \"x\", and this is our root node.\n\nNow, we have traced the path backward from \"wd\" to \"x\". To answer the question, we reverse the sequence to show the path from root to \"wd\":\n\nx->y->kd->ld->md->ud->vd->wd\n\nThis matches the answer provided in your input, confirming we've found the correct path in the tree from the root node to \"wd\"."
