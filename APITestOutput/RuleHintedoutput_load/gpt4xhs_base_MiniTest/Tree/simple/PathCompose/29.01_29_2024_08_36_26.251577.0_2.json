        "To find the answer from the given file, we need to trace the path from the root node (in this case, 'e') to the target node ('dc'). The file represents a tree where each line indicates a parent-child relationship (parent->child). We will follow the relationships until we reach the target node.\n\nStarting from the root node 'e', we look for a child node that leads us on a path to 'dc'. Based on the file: \n\n```\ne->vb\nvb->bc\nbc->dc\n```\n\nWe can trace the path from 'e' to 'dc' as follows:\n\n1. From 'e' we go to 'vb'.\n2. From 'vb' we go to 'bc'.\n3. From 'bc' we go to 'dc'.\n\nConnecting these relationships with arrows as described in the question, the path is:\n\n```\ne->vb->bc->dc\n```\n\nHowever, if we are looking for the answer to match the example format \"A->D->H\", we should replace each node with a single uppercase letter representing each unique node. But since there is no explicit mapping given between the nodes in the file and the uppercase letters, and the example path provided in the question does not correspond to any nodes in the file provided, we will assume that it was just an example and not a format requirement.\n\nSo, based on the information given and the format in which the question was asked, the path from the root node 'e' to the node 'dc' is correctly represented by \"e->vb->bc->dc\"."
