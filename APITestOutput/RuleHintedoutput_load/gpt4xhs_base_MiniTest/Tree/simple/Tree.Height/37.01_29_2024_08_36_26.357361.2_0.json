        "The given file format seems to represent a tree structure. Each line represents an edge from a parent node to a child node, with the arrow \"->\" indicating the direction. \n\nTo find the height of the root node, we need to find the longest path from the root to any leaf node. A leaf node is a node with no children (no outgoing edges). The height of the root node is the number of edges on this longest path.\n\nFrom the file, we can see that 't' is the root node since it appears on the left side of \"->\" but not on the right side of any \"->\", which means it has no parent and thus must be the root.\n\nLet's analyze the structure level by level:\n1. 't' is at level 0.\n2. Nodes directly connected to 't' are at level 1 (u, pb, kc, fd).\n3.
