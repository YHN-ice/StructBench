        "The file describes a tree structure using a simple parent->child notation, where each line represents an edge from a parent node to a child node. The root node is the one that appears on the left-hand side but never on the right-hand side of the \"->\" symbol.\n\nTo find the height of the root node, we need to identify the root node first and then find the longest path from that node to any of its leaves. The height of a node in a tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf.\n\nLet's identify the root node: It seems that 'h' is the root because it is the starting point for multiple edges and it isn't listed as a child of any other nodes.\n\nNow, let's break down the longest path calculation:\n\n1. 'h' is at level 0.\n2. Children of 'h' ('i', 'db', 'yb', 'tc') are at level 1.\n3. Grandchildren of 'h' (like 'j', 'y', 'eb', 'jb', etc.) are at level 2.\n4. Great-grandchildren of 'h' (like 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', etc.) are at level 3.\n\nWe can see that there are nodes four levels deep, such as 'k', which is a child of 'j', which is a child of 'i', which is a child of 'h'. But there are no nodes listed at a deeper level, so the longest path from the root node to any leaf node consists of three edges.\n\nTherefore, the height of the root node 'h' is 3, which matches the given answer."
