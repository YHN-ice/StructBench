The file describes a tree using a list of edges in the format `parent->child`. Each line represents a connection between two nodes, where the left-hand side is the parent and the right-hand side is the child.\n\nTo calculate the depth of the node `tb`, you need to trace the path from the root node to `tb`, incrementing the depth count for each level you traverse through the tree.\n\nHere is how to do it:\n\n1. Starting at the root node `e` (as it is never on the right-hand side of any line), which is at depth 0.\n2. Traverse through the tree following the edges to reach node `tb`.\n3. Increment the depth each time you move from a parent to a child.\n\nFollowing the edges in the file, we can find the path from `e` to `tb`:\n\n- `e` (depth 0) is connected to `ab` according to the line `e->ab`.\n- `ab` (depth 1) is connected to `qb` according to the line `ab->qb`.\n- `qb` (depth 2) is connected to `tb` according to the line `qb->tb`.\n\nBy following this path, we can see that node `tb` is at depth 3. Therefore, the correct answer, as provided in your input, is 3."
