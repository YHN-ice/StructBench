To find the depth of a specific node, you need to trace back from that node to the root, counting the number of edges (or levels) you pass through.\n\nThe root node is `v`, as it appears at the beginning of the lines and does not appear as a child node on the right side of any arrow (`->`). To find the depth of the node `qc`, follow these steps:\n\n1. Locate the line in the file where `qc` is a child node. This is the line `nc->qc`.\n2. Note that `qc`'s parent is `nc`.\n3. Now locate the parent of `nc`, which is in the line `mc->nc`.\n4. Note that `mc`'s parent is `v`.\n5. Since `v` is the root and does not have a parent in this tree, you've reached the root.\n\nCounting the steps from `qc` up to the root:\n\n- `qc` to `nc`: 1 step\n- `nc` to `mc`: 1 step\n- `mc` to `v`: 1 step\n\nThis gives a total of 3 steps, so the depth of node `qc` is 3, which matches the given answer."
