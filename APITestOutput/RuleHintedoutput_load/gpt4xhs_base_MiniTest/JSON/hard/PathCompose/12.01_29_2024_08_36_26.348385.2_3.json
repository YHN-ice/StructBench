Starting from the root object, which we'll refer to as `obj`, you want to access the `subs` key, which contains an array. The value \"d\" is located within the first object of this array, so you'll use index 0 to access it: `obj[\"subs\"][0]`.\n\nWithin this object, there's a key \"Y\" that holds the value \"d\".
