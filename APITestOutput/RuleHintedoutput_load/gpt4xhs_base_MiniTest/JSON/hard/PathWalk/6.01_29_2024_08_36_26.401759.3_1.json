Locate the \"subs\" key within the top-level object. The value associated with the \"subs\" key is an array, as indicated by the square brackets `[ ]`.\n3. Find the first object in this array. The objects in the array are also enclosed in curly braces `{ }`.\n4. Look for the \"id\" key inside the first object of the \"subs\" array.\n5.
