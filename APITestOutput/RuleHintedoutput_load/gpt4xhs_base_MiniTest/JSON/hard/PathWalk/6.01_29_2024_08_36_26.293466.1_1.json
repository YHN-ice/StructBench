        "To get the answer from the file provided, we need to look for the first object within the \"subs\" array and then retrieve the \"id\" of that object. The file content is in JSON format, which is a common data representation for structured data. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the first object's \"id\" within \"subs\":\n\n1. Identify the \"subs\" array: The \"subs\" key is at the root level of the JSON structure, so we find this key to access its array value.\n\n2. Look for the first object in the \"subs\" array: The array is ordered, so we take the first element (object) of this array.\n\n3. Extract the \"id\" value of that object: Within this first object, we look for the key named \"id\" and take its value.\n\nLooking at the JSON structure provided:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\":\"u\",\n  \"Z\":\"j\",\n  \"Y\":\"i\",\n  \"subs\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"v\",\n      \"X\":\"h\",\n      \"subs\":[...]\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWe navigate to `\"subs\"`:\n```json\n\"subs\":[\n  {\n    \"id\":\"v\",\n    ...\n  },\n  ...\n]\n```\n\nThe first object in `\"subs\"` has an `\"id\"` with the value `\"v\"`, so the answer to the question \"What is the first object's id of subs?\" is:\n\nAnswer: `v`"
