        "To answer this question, you need to understand the JSON structure and identify the deepest level objects that do not contain any further lists or dictionaries (dicts) within their \"subs\" key.\n\nThe input JSON is a hierarchical structure where each object may contain a key named \"subs\" that holds a list of other objects. The most deeply nested objects are those at the bottom of this hierarchy, which, in their \"subs\" list, do not have any further objects (i.e., the \"subs\" list is empty: \"subs\":[]).\n\nFrom the provided JSON input file, you can see that there are several objects with an empty \"subs\" list. These objects are the most deeply nested because they do not contain any other objects within them.\n\nTo get the answer, you would find all objects where \"subs\" is an empty list and output them, separating each object with a double newline character (\\n\\n) as requested. The answer provided is the correct extraction of those most deeply nested objects from the given file. Here's how it is done manually:\n\n1. Start from the first level of \"subs\" and iterate over each object.\n2. For each object, check its \"subs\" key.\n3. If the \"subs\" list is empty, this is one of the objects to include in the answer.\n4. Otherwise, go one level deeper and repeat the process until you find all objects with an empty \"subs\" list.\n5. Extract those objects and format them according to the instructions.\n\nThe answer provided shows all objects from the original JSON that have an empty \"subs\" list, which makes them the most deeply nested objects according to the question's definition. Each object is separated by two newline characters (\\n\\n), as per the given instructions."
