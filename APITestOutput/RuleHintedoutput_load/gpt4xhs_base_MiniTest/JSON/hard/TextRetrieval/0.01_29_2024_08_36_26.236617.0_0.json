        "To find the object with the specified `id` of \"i\" in the given JSON file, you need to search through the hierarchical structure of the file, looking for an object with the key `\"id\"` whose value is `\"i\"`. In this case, you can see that the JSON structure is nested, with top-level objects containing `\"subs\"` arrays that may contain more objects.\n\nHere is how you can navigate through the JSON file to find the required object:\n1. Start at the root of the JSON structure.\n2. Check if the `\"id\"` key of the current object matches \"i\".\n3. If not, move to the `\"subs\"` array and repeat step 2 for each object within this array.\n4. Continue this process recursively until you find an object with `\"id\"` equal to \"i\".\n\nFollowing these steps in the provided JSON file, you'll see that the object with `\"id\":\"i\"` is nested within several layers of `\"subs\"` arrays. The path to reach it is:\n\n- Start with the root object (`\"id\":\"g\"`).\n- Navigate to its first `\"subs\"` array.\n- Look at the first object within that array (`\"id\":\"h\"`).\n- Inside that object, navigate to its `\"subs\"` array.\n- The first object in that array is the one with `\"id\":\"i\"`.\n\nHere is the excerpt from the JSON file that corresponds to the object with `id` \"i\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\":\"i\",\n  \"V\":\"zy\",\n  \"U\":\"yy\",\n  \"subs\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"j\",\n      \"T\":\"xy\",\n      \"subs\":[]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\":\"k\",\n      \"S\":\"wy\",\n      \"subs\":[]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis matches the answer provided in your input, showing how you get the answer from the file: by searching through the nested arrays until you find the object with the corresponding `id`."
