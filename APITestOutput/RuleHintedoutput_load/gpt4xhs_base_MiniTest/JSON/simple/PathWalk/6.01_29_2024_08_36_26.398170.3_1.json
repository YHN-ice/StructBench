        "To answer the question \"What is the first object's id of subs?\" given the file in a special JSON-like format, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the provided file content as JSON to understand the structure of the data.\n2. Locate the \"subs\" key in the top-level object (denoted by curly braces `{}`).\n3. Access the first element of the array associated with the \"subs\" key since we are interested in the \"first object's id\" within \"subs\".\n4. Extract the \"id\" value from this first object.\n\nFollowing these steps, let's parse the given file content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\":\"n\",\n  \"Z\":\"t\",\n  \"subs\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"o\",\n      \"Y\":\"s\",\n      \"subs\":[\n        {\n          \"id\":\"p\",\n          \"X\":\"r\",\n          \"subs\":[]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNow, we access the first element of \"subs\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\":\"o\",\n  \"Y\":\"s\",\n  \"subs\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"p\",\n      \"X\":\"r\",\n      \"subs\":[]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom this object, we extract the value of the \"id\" key, which is `\"o\"`.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: `o`."
