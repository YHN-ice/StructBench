Here is a step-by-step guide on how to extract the answer from the file:\n\n1. Identify the main elements in the file: The file structure consists of a dictionary-like object with key-value pairs. The key \"subs\" is of interest as it contains a list of objects.\n\n2. Locate the \"subs\" key: Search for the key \"subs\" in the outermost object, which represents an array (`[]`) of objects.\n\n3. Access the first object within the \"subs\" list: Since the question asks for the \"first object's id,\" you need to look at the first element in the array associated with the \"subs\" key, which is:\n\n```json\n{\n \"id\":\"x\",\n \"Y\":\"u\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n   \"id\":\"y\",\n   \"X\":\"t\",\n   \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n}\n```\n\n4. Find the \"id\" of the first object: Now that you have the first object within \"subs\", you can access its \"id\" field to get the answer.\n\nThe answer is: `x` (the value associated with the \"id\" key of the first object within the \"subs\" array)."
