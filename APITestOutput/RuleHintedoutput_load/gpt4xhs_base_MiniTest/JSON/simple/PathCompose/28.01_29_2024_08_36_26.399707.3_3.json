Start with the root object, which we will refer to as `obj`.\n2. The first key to access is `\"subs\"`, which is an array.\n3. Since we want the first element of that array, we use index `[0]` to access it.\n4. Within this object, there's another `\"subs\"` key, which is again an array.\n5. We again want the first element of this inner array, so we use index `[0]` to access it.\n6. Finally, within this object, there is a key `\"X\"`, which contains the value `\"r\"`.\n\nPutting it all together, you can access the value \"r\" using the following notation:\n\n```plaintext\nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"]\n``` \n\nThis corresponds to the path provided in the answer:\n\n```plaintext\nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"]\n``` \n\nAnd this will return the string `\"r\"` from the given file structure."
