The deeply nested object is the one that has an empty list for 'subs', indicating that it contains no further nested objects.\n\nIn the provided file, we can see that there's a hierarchy of objects nested within each other through the 'subs' key. If we inspect the 'subs' arrays at each level, we find that the most deeply nested object which has an empty 'subs' array is the following:\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\":\"e\",\n  \"X\":\"g\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n}\n```\n\nThis object is the most deeply nested as it is contained within another object, and it itself does not contain any further nested objects (since \"subs\" is an empty list).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is the above JSON object:\n\n```\n{\n\"id\":\"e\",\n\"X\":\"g\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}\n```"
