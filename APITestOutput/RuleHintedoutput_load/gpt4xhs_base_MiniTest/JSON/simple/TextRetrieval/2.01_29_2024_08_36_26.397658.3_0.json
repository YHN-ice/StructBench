Look at the top-level object in the provided JSON file; it has \"id\": \"n\", which is not what we are looking for.\n2.

The first (and in this case, only) object inside the top-level \"subs\" array has \"id\": \"o\", which is still not the correct one.\n4. This object also has a \"subs\" array; inspect each object within this array.\n5. Inside this nested \"subs\" array, there is an object with \"id\": \"p\", which matches our search criteria.\n\nThe content of the object with \"id\": \"p\" is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"p\",\n  \"X\": \"r\",\n  \"subs\": []\n}\n```\n\nCopy this excerpt as it appears in the JSON file, and that will be your answer."
