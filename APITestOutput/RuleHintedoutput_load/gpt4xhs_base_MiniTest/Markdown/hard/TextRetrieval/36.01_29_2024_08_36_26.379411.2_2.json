Print each extracted filename on a separate line, as instructed.\n\nBy following these steps manually or programmatically through the provided file content, you should end up with the following list:\n\n```\nvf.gif\nwf.jpeg\nxf.jpeg\nzf.jpg\nag.jpeg\nbg.jpg\nyf.gif\n```\n\nHowever, please note that the answer provided in the initial statement is not in the same order as the images appear in the provided file content.
