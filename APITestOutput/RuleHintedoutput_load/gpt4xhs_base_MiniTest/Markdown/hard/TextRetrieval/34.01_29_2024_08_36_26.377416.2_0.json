Look through each line of the file's text.\n2. Identify the patterns that start and end with `**`; these indicate bold text.\n3. Extract the content within the `**` without including the asterisks themselves.\n4. Print each extracted bold text on a new line.\n\nFor the given file, the bold texts are as follows:\n\n- **kangaroo**\n- **lamb**\n- **monkey**\n- **nob**\n- **oops**\n- **perish**\n- **ravish**\n- **qualify**\n\nPrinting these raw texts separated by a newline character would result in:\n\n```\nkangaroo\nlamb\nmonkey\nnob\noops\nperish\nravish\nqualify\n```\n\nNote: The above bold texts are extracted based on the visible pattern in the file content you provided.
