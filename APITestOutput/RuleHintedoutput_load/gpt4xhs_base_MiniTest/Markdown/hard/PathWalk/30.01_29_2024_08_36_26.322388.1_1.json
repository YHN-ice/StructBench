        "To get the answer from the file, we need to follow the hierarchical structure of the markdown content. Here's how we can identify the content of the 1st subsubsection under the 1st subsection under the 1st section:\n\n1. Sections in the markdown file are indicated by headings starting with `#`. The 1st section would be indicated by the first occurrence of `#` followed by a single space.\n2. Subsections are indicated by headings starting with `##`. The 1st subsection under the 1st section would be the first `##` heading that comes after the 1st `#` heading.\n3. Subsubsections are indicated by headings starting with `###`. The 1st subsubsection under the 1st subsection would be the first `###` heading that comes after the 1st `##` heading within the 1st section.\n\nLooking at the given markdown file content, here's how we locate the requested content:\n\n- The first section starts with `# m`.\n- The first subsection under that section starts with `## n`.\n- The first subsubsection under that subsection starts with `### o`.\n\nTherefore, the content of the 1st subsubsection under the 1st subsection under the 1st section is:\n\n```\n### o\nbanana far yog**perish**urt idiot unique jargon cafe unique perish transformer ravish far dentist wake ravish nob qualify salvage apple vigor\n```\n\nThis is the excerpt from the file, including the heading line and any sub-section (although there is no sub-section content below this heading)."
