        "To get the answer from the given file, you need to:\n\n1. Understand the structure of the file: It appears that the file is in two sections, with the first section containing personal details such as gender, age, name, height, weight, and color; and the second section containing work-related details such as status, salary, company, and location. The `primeKey` serves as a unique identifier that links the two sections for each person.\n\n2. Identify the data field relevant to the question: Since the question is asking for the number of people with a salary more than 358275, you need to focus on the `salary` field in the second section of the file.\n\n3. Filter the records based on the condition: Extract all the records where the `salary` is more than 358275.\n\n4. Count the number of records that satisfy the condition: After filtering, count how many people meet this criterion to get the answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Looking at the `salary` field in the second section, we find the following entries greater than 358275:\n  - a: 872868\n  - c: 793436\n  - d: 564897\n  - e: 416849\n  - f: 746286\n  - i: 787530\n  - k: 410541\n  - l: 931860\n\nThese entries correspond to individuals with salaries higher than 358275.\n\n- There are a total of 8 records that meet this condition (one for each letter from a, c, d, e, f, i, k, and l).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"How many people work with a salary more than 358275?\" is 8."
