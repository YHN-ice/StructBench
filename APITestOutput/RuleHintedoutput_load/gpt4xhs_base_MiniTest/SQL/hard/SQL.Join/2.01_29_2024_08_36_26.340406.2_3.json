        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in IL are taller than 175?\" using the provided file, you need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant fields in the file. In this case, you are interested in the \"height\", \"location\", and employment status (implied by \"work\" in the question, which could be interpreted as being employed or simply having a location associated with work).\n\n2. Filter the entries based on the location \"IL\" to find people associated with Illinois.\n\n3. Determine if these individuals are employed (\"work\" implies employment, although the term is a bit ambiguous).\n\n4. Among those filtered results, count how many have a height greater than 175.\n\nFrom the given file:\n\n- There is one person with a location of \"IL\", which is primeKey g (retired).\n\n- This person has a height of 127, which is less than 175.\n\nSince there are no individuals who are both working in IL and taller than 175, the answer to the question is 0."
