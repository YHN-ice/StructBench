Both sections are linked by a 'primeKey'.\n\nFirst, we need to find all people who work in CA by looking at the employment details in the second part of the file:\n\nprimeKey status salary company location\n...\nb employed 197329 NVIDIA CA\nd unemployed 564897 Apple CA\nl retired 931860 Google CA\n\nFrom this, we have primeKeys 'b', 'd', and 'l' as individuals associated with CA (one is retired but for the purpose of this answer, we're considering past employment too).\n\nNext, we check their heights:\n\nprimeKey gender age name height weight color\n...\nb male 18 d 121 124 white\nd male 36 f 196 141 mulatto\nl female 19 n 145 129 white\n\nAmong these individuals, only primeKey 'd' has a height greater than 167 cm.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 1, as only one person (primeKey 'd') who works (or has worked) in CA is taller than 167 cm."
