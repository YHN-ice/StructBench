The file lists individuals with their respective genders. You would go through each row and count how many times \"male\" appears in the \"gender\" column.\n\nHere's how you would do it:\n\n1. Start reading the file from the line where the data begins (ignoring the header line that contains \"primeKey\tgender\tage\tname\theight\tweight\tcolor\").\n2. For each line (which represents a person's data), look at the value in the \"gender\" column.\n3. If the value is \"male,\" increment your count by 1.\n4. Continue this process for all lines until you reach the end of the gender-related section.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- Row (d) has gender \"male\"\n- Row (g) has gender \"male\"\n- Row (h) has gender \"male\"\n\nThese are the only rows with \"male\" in the gender column.
