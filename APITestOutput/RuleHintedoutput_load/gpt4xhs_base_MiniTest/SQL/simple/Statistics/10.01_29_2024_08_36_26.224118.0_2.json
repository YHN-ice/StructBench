Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Look at the section of the file that contains the gender information. In this case, it appears to be a tab-delimited table with headers indicating the data fields.\n\n2. Identify the column header for gender, which is \"gender\" in this file.\n\n3. Scan down the column under this header and count each time you encounter the word \"female.\"\n\nThe data under the gender column is as follows:\n\n- male\n- male\n- female\n- male\n- female\n- male\n- male\n- female\n\nCounting each occurrence of \"female\" gives us a total of 3. Therefore, the answer to the question is 3, as there are 3 females listed in the file."
