        "The provided file seems to contain a table of records with two sections separated by empty lines. Each section includes a header row that defines the fields for the records below it. To get the answer to the question, \"How many people work with salary more than 204201?\" you need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant fields in the file needed to answer the question. In this case, we're interested in the 'status' and 'salary' fields.\n\n2. Filter out records based on the 'status' field to include only those people who are employed since the question is asking about people who work.\n\n3. From the filtered records, count the number of records where the ‘salary’ field is greater than 204201.\n\nLooking at the second section of the file, you can see that each person's employment status and salary are listed. Let's apply the filter criteria to the data:\n\n- a: unemployed, so this record is excluded.\n- b: retired, not working, so this record is excluded.\n- c: retired, not working, so this record is excluded.\n- d: employed with a salary of 516418, which is greater than 204201, so this record is included.\n- e: employed with a salary of 981032, which is greater than 204201, so this record is included.\n- f: retired, not working, so this record is excluded.\n- g: unemployed, so this record is excluded.\n\nOnly records 'd' and 'e' meet both criteria (employed and earning more than 204201). Therefore, based on the given file snippet, the answer should be 2 rather than 5.\n\nHowever, if there's additional data in the file that isn't shown in the snippet provided, you would apply the same method to all records to get the total count. If the answer given as \"5\" is indeed correct, then there must be three other employed individuals with salaries greater than 204201 that are not visible in the provided snippet."
