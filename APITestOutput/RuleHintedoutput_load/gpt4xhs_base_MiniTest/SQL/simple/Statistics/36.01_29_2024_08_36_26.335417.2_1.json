        "To answer the given question, we would need to examine the salary information provided in the file and count the number of people with salaries greater than 230884.\n\nThe relevant section of the file is the second part where it shows the `primeKey`, `status`, `salary`, `company`, and `location`. Each row after the headers represents a person, with their corresponding salary listed in the `salary` column.\n\nHere’s how you can manually find the answer:\n\n1. Look at each row under the `salary` column to check if the salary is greater than 230884.\n2. Count each instance where this condition is true.\n3. Sum up the total number of instances.\n\nLet’s apply this process to the provided data:\n\n- Row with `primeKey` a: Salary is 751488, which is more than 230884.\n- Row with `primeKey` b: Salary is 805829, which is more than 230884.\n- Row with `primeKey` c: Salary is 202616, which is less than 230884 (do not count).\n- Row with `primeKey` d: Salary is 520040, which is more than 230884.\n- Row with `primeKey` e: Salary is 575065, which is more than 230884.\n- Row with `primeKey` f: Salary is 603060, which is more than 230884.\n- Row with `primeKey` g: Salary is 632481, which is more than 230884.\n\nCounting the instances where the salary exceeds 230884, we get a total of 6 people (a, b, d, e, f, and g). Therefore, the answer to the question \"How many people work with a salary more than 230884?\" is 6."
