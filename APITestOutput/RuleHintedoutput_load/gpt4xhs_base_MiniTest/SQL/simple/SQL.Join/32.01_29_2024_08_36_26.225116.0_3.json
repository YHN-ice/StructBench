        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in IL are taller than 159?\" using the given file, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant columns:\n- `primeKey`: This column is used to join the information from the two sections of the file.\n- `height`: This column tells you the height of each individual.\n- `location`: This column tells you where each individual works.\n- `status`: This column indicates the employment status of each individual.\n\n2. Filter based on the location:\n- You need to find people who work in Illinois (IL).\n\n3. Filter based on employment status:\n- Since the question asks for people who \"work\" in IL, you need individuals who are employed.\n\n4. Filter based on height:\n- The individuals must be taller than 159.\n\n5. Count the number of individuals that meet all criteria.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\na. No match, works in CA.\nb. No match, works in GA and unemployed.\nc. No match, works in CA and unemployed.\nd. No match, retired, works in NY.\ne. No match, works in GA.\nf. No match, works in GA.\ng. No match, works in NY.\nh. Matches, employed, works in IL, and has a height of 210.\n\nThere is only one person (with primeKey h) who meets all the criteria: employed, works in IL, and is taller than 159.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n1"
