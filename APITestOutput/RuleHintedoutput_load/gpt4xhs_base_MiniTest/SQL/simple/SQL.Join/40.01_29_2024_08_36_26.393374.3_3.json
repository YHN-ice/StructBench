        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in NY are taller than 171?\" using the provided file, you would need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the columns in the file that are relevant to the question:\n   - `height`: This column indicates the height of each person.\n   - `status`: This column indicates the employment status of each person.\n   - `location`: This column indicates the location where each person works.\n\n2. Filter records based on the criteria provided in the question:\n   - Filter for people who work in NY (`location` column should be \"NY\").\n   - Among those, filter for people who are taller than 171 (`height` column should be greater than 171).\n   - Ensure that only employed individuals are considered (since \"who work\" implies `status` should be \"employed\").\n\n3. Count the number of records that match these filters.\n\nHowever, from the provided file content, we can see that there is no one listed with a location of \"NY\" (New York). All locations are other states (IL, WA, CA, GA, TX). Therefore, without any records indicating a location of NY, the answer to the question is 0, which means there are no people who work in NY and are also taller than 171 as per the data provided in the file."
