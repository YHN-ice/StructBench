        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in CA are taller than 180?\" from the given file, you need to analyze the file's content, which is structured in a tabular format with two tables. The first table contains personal attributes including `primeKey`, `gender`, `age`, `name`, `height`, `weight`, and `color`. The second table is linked to the first one using `primeKey` and contains information about the person's employment status, including `status`, `salary`, `company`, and `location`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process to get the answer:\n\n1. Look for individuals working in \"CA\". To do this, check the `location` in the second table for entries with \"CA\".\n2. Once you have identified those individuals, check their corresponding `primeKey` to link them to their personal attributes in the first table.\n3. After locating the matching entries in the first table, examine the `height` attribute to identify individuals who are taller than 180 cm.\n4. Count the number of individuals who meet both criteria: working in \"CA\" and being taller than 180 cm.\n\nNow, let's follow these steps with the given information:\n\n- In the second table, we can see that individuals with primeKey `a` and `e` are located in \"CA\".\n- Next, we look for individuals `a` and `e` in the first table to check their height.\n- Individual `a` is female, 46 years old, with a height of 184 cm.\n- Individual `e` is male, 70 years old, with a height of 169 cm.\n\nOut of these two individuals, only individual `a` has a height greater than 180 cm. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the file, there is only 1 person who works in CA and is taller than 180 cm. The answer is 1."
