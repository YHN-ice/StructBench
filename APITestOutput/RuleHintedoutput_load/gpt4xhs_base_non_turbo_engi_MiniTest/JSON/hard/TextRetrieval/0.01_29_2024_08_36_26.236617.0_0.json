        "To get the answer from the file, we need to parse the JSON file and look for the object with \"id\": \"i\". The path to this object is \"g\" → \"h\" → \"i\". JSON parsers can traverse along this path to reach the desired object.\n\nHere is how it can be done in Python:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the data\nwith open('data.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Define a function to find an object with a specific id\ndef find_object(data, id):\n    if isinstance(data, dict):\n        if data.get('id') == id:\n            return data\n        for key in data:\n            item = find_object(data[key], id)\n            if item is not None:\n                return item\n    elif isinstance(data, list):\n        for element in data:\n            item = find_object(element, id)\n            if item is not None:\n                return item\n\n# Use the function to find the object\nitem = find_object(data, 'i')\nprint(json.dumps(item, indent=2))\n```\n\nPlease replace 'data.json' with the path or URL of your actual JSON file. This script loads the JSON data into a Python dictionary, defines a recursive function to search for a specific id, and then uses that function to find and print the desired object.\n\nPlease note that JSON files can be complex and nested deeply. The above code handles this using recursion. However, it may fail on very deep files due to Python's recursion limit.\n\nAlso, ensure that the JSON file is properly formatted and free of syntax errors.
