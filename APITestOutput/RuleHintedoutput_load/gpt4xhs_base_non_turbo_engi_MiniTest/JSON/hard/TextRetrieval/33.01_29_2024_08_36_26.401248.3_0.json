        "In order to get the answer from the JSON file, you would need to parse the JSON file in a programming language such as Python or JavaScript. \n\nHere is a high-level step by step process on how you might go about this:\n\n1. **Read and Parse the JSON file**: Use a JSON parsing library in your preferred programming language to read and parse the JSON file into a format that's easier to work with (like a dictionary in Python or an Object in JavaScript).\n\n2. **Traverse the JSON Object**: You would then need to traverse the JSON object to find the \"object\" with \"id\" equal to \"u.\" This can be done using a recursive function that goes through each \"id\" attribute in the main object and its \"subs\" (if any). \n\n3. **Store or Return the Result**: When you find the object with the given \"id,\" store its details or return it as the result.\n\nHere is a simple Python example using the `json` module:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_object_with_id(data, target_id):\n    if \"id\" in data and data[\"id\"] == target_id:\n        return data\n    if \"subs\" in data:\n        for sub in data[\"subs\"]:\n            result = find_object_with_id(sub, target_id)\n            if result:\n                return result\n    return None\n\n# Load JSON data\nwith open('file.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Find object with id 'u'\nresult = find_object_with_id(data, 'u')\n\nprint(json.dumps(result, indent=4))  # Pretty print result\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n{\n    \"id\": \"u\",\n    \"V\": \"wy\",\n    \"U\": \"vy\",\n    \"subs\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis is the object with id `u` from the JSON file.
