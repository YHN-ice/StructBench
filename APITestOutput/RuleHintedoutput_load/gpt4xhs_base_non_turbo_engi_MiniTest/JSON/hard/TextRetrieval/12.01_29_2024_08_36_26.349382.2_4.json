        "To get the answer from the JSON file, you would need to parse and analyze the file using a programming language or tool that supports JSON, such as Python, JavaScript or a specialized tool like jq.\n\nHere are the steps to extract the data:\n\n1. **Load the JSON**: Use a built-in library to load the JSON file. For example, in Python, you can use `json.load()` function.\n\n2. **Create recursive function**: Create a recursive function that traverses the JSON structure. This function will check each dictionary object in the JSON.\n\n3. **Identify deeply nested objects**: Check if each dictionary object has a key called \"subs\" with an empty list as its value.
