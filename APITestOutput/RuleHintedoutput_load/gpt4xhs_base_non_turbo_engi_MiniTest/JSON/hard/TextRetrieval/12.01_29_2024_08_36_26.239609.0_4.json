        "To answer this question, you need to understand the structure of the JSON file. The JSON file here seems to represent a tree-like structure with each node having an \"id\", a few other key-value pairs and a \"subs\" list representing child nodes.\n\nThe most deeply nested objects are the ones where the \"subs\" list is empty. These can be found by writing a recursive function that goes through each node starting from the root. If the \"subs\" list of a node is empty, that node is a leaf node or one of the most deeply nested objects.\n\nHere's an example of what this might look like in Python:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_deepest_objects(node):\n    if not node.get('subs'):\n        return [node]\n    else:\n        deepest_objects = []\n        for child in node.get('subs'):\n            deepest_objects.extend(find_deepest_objects(child))\n        return deepest_objects\n\n# Load the JSON data\ndata = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Find the deepest objects\ndeepest_objects = find_deepest_objects(data)\n\n# Print them out as they appear in the JSON file\nfor obj in deepest_objects:\n    print(json.dumps(obj, indent=2))\n    print(\"\\n\\n\")\n```\n\nIn this program, `find_deepest_objects` is a recursive function that takes a node as input. If the \"subs\" list of that node is empty, it returns a list containing that node. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on each child node and collects their results. The final result is a list of all the most deeply nested objects.\n\nRunning this program on the provided JSON file would return the objects provided in the answer."
