        "To extract the required data from the file, follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the JSON File: Use a JSON parser that can handle the file format. This will convert the JSON file into a data structure that can be manipulated using programming logic. For instance, in Python, you might use the `json.load()` function to load the JSON file into a Python dictionary.\n\n2. Traverse the Data Structure: Once the JSON is parsed into a data structure, you need to navigate to the desired information. In this case, you are looking for the first object's id in the \"subs\" array. \n\nIn Python, you could use the following code to get to this information:\n\n```python\n# Let's assume 'data' is your loaded JSON\nfirst_sub_object = data[\"subs\"][0]\nfirst_sub_id = first_sub_object[\"id\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, `first_sub_id` would hold the value 'h', which is the answer to the question.\n\n3. Handle Errors: As mentioned, various errors can occur when reading and parsing JSON files. Always include error handling code to gracefully handle potential issues such as file I/O errors, invalid JSON format, and key errors when accessing data in the structure."
