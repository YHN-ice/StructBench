If the structure is very complex, it might be difficult to navigate and extract the correct information without a detailed understanding of the structure.\n\n3. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it could take a long time to parse, or there might be memory limitations if trying to load the entire file at once in memory.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Questions**: If the questions about the JSON file are ambiguous or do not clearly specify which part of the JSON to look at, it can be challenging to provide accurate answers.\n\n5. **Data Types and Formats**: JSON supports data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. If the expected type of a value is not clear from the question, misinterpretation can occur. Additionally, dates and other formats may require conversion or special handling.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the file uses a character encoding that is not properly handled, certain characters may not be parsed correctly.\n\n7. **Updates to Data**: If the JSON file is subject to updates and changes, ensuring that you are working with the latest version of the data can be a challenge.\n\n8. **Security Considerations**: If the JSON file contains sensitive information, there might be security considerations to take into account before parsing and disclosing details from the file.\n\n9. **Missing or Inconsistent Data**: If the expected data is missing from the JSON or if there are inconsistencies within the data, it will complicate extracting accurate information.\n\n10. **Schema Changes**: If the schema (structure) of the JSON file changes over time, previous parsing logic might not work for newer versions of the file.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would typically ensure correct JSON syntax, understand the structure of the JSON, handle large files with stream processing, clarify ambiguities before proceeding, handle different data types appropriately, handle encoding correctly, check for the latest data updates, ensure security compliance, have error handling for missing data, and keep up with any schema changes."
