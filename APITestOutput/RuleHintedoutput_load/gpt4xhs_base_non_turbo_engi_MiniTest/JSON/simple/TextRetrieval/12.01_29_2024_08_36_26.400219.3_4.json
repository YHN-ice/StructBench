        "To answer the question \"What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?The content should be an excerpt as they appear in the JSON file, separated by \\n\\n.\", we need to parse the JSON file and identify the objects without any nested lists or dictionaries. \n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Load the JSON File**: Use a method to load the JSON file, such as `json.load()` function in Python. This function converts the JSON file into a Python object.\n\n2. **Parse the JSON**: The next step is to parse the JSON file. To find the most deeply nested objects, we would likely need to use a recursive function to delve into the nested structure.\n\n3. **Identify deepest objects**: In the recursive function, we need to look for objects (in this case, dictionaries in Python) that do not have values of types list or dictionary. We can identify these by checking the type of each value in the dictionary. If all values are of types other than list or dictionary, we consider it a \"most deeply nested object\".\n\n4. **Format the Output**: The question asks for \"an excerpt as they appear in the JSON file\", so we need to convert these deeply nested objects back into JSON strings. In Python, we can use `json.dumps()` for this.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return these JSON strings separated by \"\\n\\n\".\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the JSON file is correctly formatted and doesn't contain any syntax errors. It also assumes that the file is not so large as to cause memory issues.\n\nHere is a Python code that does this:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_deepest_objs(obj):\n    if isinstance(obj, dict):\n        if not any(isinstance(val, (dict, list)) for val in obj.values()):\n            return [json.dumps(obj)]\n        else:\n            return [val for sublist in map(find_deepest_objs, obj.values()) for val in sublist]\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        return [val for sublist in map(find_deepest_objs, obj) for val in sublist]\n    else:\n        return []\n\nwith open('file.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n    deepest_objs = find_deepest_objs(data)\n    answer = '\\n\\n'.join(deepest_objs)\n    print(answer)\n```\n\nThis script will print all most deeply nested objects"
