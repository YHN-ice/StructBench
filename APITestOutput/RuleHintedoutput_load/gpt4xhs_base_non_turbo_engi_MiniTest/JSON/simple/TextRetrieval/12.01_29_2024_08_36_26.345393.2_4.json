Define a function that takes a JSON object and a depth value as arguments. The depth value should start at 0 for the first call.\n\n2. Inside the function, loop over each key-value pair in the JSON object. \n\n3. If a value is of type object or list, recursively call the defined function on this value with an increased depth value by 1.\n\n4. If a value is not of type object or list, it means it's a leaf node (the most deeply nested object). In this case, check if the depth of this object is greater than the current maximum depth.\n\n5.
