Misinterpretation of these types can lead to incorrect answers (e.g., treating a numeric string as an integer).\n\n8. **Updating Data**: If the data within the JSON file changes frequently and the updates are not tracked, providing an accurate answer based on outdated information can be challenging.\n\n9. **Path Expressions**: Constructing the correct path expressions to query nested data can be difficult, especially if you're using a query language or path notation like JSONPath or jq.\n\n10. **Performance Constraints**: If there are performance constraints in processing the file, then optimizing the search for answers within the JSON could be necessary.\n\n11. **External References**: If the JSON contains references to external files or URLs that need to be fetched or interpreted, this could add complexity and require additional steps to get the answer.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it's important to have a clear understanding of the JSON structure and content, ensure that questions are specific and targeted, and have robust error handling and data validation mechanisms in place."

        "To answer this specific question, we would need to parse the JSON file and navigate through its structure to find the object with id 'x'.
