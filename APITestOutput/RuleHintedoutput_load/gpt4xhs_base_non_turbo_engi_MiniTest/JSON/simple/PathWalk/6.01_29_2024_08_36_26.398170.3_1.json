Data Variability: The structure of JSON files can vary greatly. Without a consistent schema, it can be challenging to know where to look for the required data.\n\n4. Large Files: Very large JSON files can be difficult to handle due to memory constraints or performance issues during parsing.\n\n5. Encoding Issues: If the file is not encoded in a standard format (e.g., UTF-8), there might be issues with reading and interpreting special characters.\n\n6. Ambiguity: Questions about the data may be ambiguous, making it unclear what information the question is asking for.\n\n7. Tools and Libraries: The choice of tools or libraries for parsing the JSON could impact the ability to extract information, especially if those tools have limitations or bugs.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser must correctly handle the file's syntax, traverse the structure efficiently, manage memory appropriately for large files, and interpret the questions accurately to provide the correct answers.

Load JSON: With the JSON file, you can load it using `data = json.loads(file)`.\n3. Traverse the JSON file: As we know from the question, we need to look inside \"subs\". Since \"subs\" is a list of dictionaries, we can access the first object's id using `first_object_id = data['subs'][0]['id']`.\n\nAt this point, `first_object_id` will contain the value \"o\", which is the answer to the question.\n\nNote: This is a simple example and real-world scenarios might be more complex due to the potential difficulties and obstacles mentioned above.
