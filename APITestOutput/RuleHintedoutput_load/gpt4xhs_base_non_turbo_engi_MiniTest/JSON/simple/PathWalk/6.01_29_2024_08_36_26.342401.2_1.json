        "To answer the question, \"What is the first object's id of subs?\", we need to parse the given JSON file and navigate through its structure to find the requested information. \n\nHere are the steps to do that:\n\n1. **Read the JSON File**: To begin, we first need to read the JSON file as a string. Depending on your programming language, there are various ways to open a file. For example, in Python, you would use the built-in `open()` function.\n\n2. **Parse the JSON**: After reading the JSON file, we need to parse the JSON string into a native data structure that we can work with. Many programming languages offer this functionality either built-in or as part of a library. In Python, for instance, we can use the json module's `json.loads()` method to parse a JSON string into a Python dictionary.\n\n3. **Navigate to 'subs' Key**: Once we have our data structure (in this case a dictionary), we can start navigating through it to find the information we need. We are interested in the 'subs' key, so we can retrieve its associated value using square bracket notation (`dict['subs']`). This gives us an array of objects.\n\n4. **Access the First Object's 'id'**: Now that we have our array of objects, we want to get the 'id' of the first object. We can retrieve the first object from the array using an index of 0 (`array[0]`), and then access its 'id' in a similar way as before (`dict['id']`).\n\n5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the result.\n\nIn pseudo-code, this would look something like this:\n\n```\nfile = open('file.json', 'r')\ndata = json.loads(file.read())\nsubs = data['subs']\nfirst_id = subs[0]['id']\nprint(first_id)  # prints: d\n```\n\nIn this process, we must be careful to handle exceptions and errors appropriately. For example, if any of the keys or indices we attempt to access do not exist, an error will be thrown. We can prevent this by checking if they exist before trying to access them.\n\nAlso remember that JSON keys are case sensitive, so 'id' is different from 'ID'.  Always ensure you are using the correct case when accessing keys."
