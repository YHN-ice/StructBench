        "To answer the question \"What is the first object's id of subs?\" from the provided YAML file, one would implement the following steps:\n\n1. Use a YAML Parser: First, you would need to use a robust YAML parsing library to read the YAML file. Python's PyYAML, JavaScript's js-yaml or Ruby's yaml are examples of these libraries.\n\n2. Extract the Data: After successfully loading the YAML file, you would have a data structure (usually a dictionary or an object depending on the language you're using) which you can navigate to access the desired information. \n\n3. Navigate to the Value: You would navigate to the 'subs' key of the dictionary (or object) and then access its first element (which is another object). \n\n4.
