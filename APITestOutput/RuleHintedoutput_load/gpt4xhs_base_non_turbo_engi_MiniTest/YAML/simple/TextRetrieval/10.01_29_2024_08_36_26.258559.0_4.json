        "To answer the question, one would start by loading the YAML file using a suitable library in Python, such as PyYAML or ruamel.yaml. The loaded file is generally represented as a dictionary or a list of dictionaries, which can be navigated to retrieve the required information.\n\nGiven the content of the YAML file, we can tell that it represents a nested structure with 'subs' as a key indicating a deeper level. The objects with no further 'subs' are the most deeply nested ones.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet using the PyYAML library that could be used to extract the most deeply nested objects:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nfile_content = \"\"\"\nid: \"e\"\nZ: j,\nsubs: \n- id: \"f\"\n  Y: i,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"g\"\n    X: h,\n    subs: []\n\"\"\"\n\ndata = yaml.safe_load(file_content)\n\ndef get_deepest_objects(node):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursive function to retrieve deepest objects in hierarchy.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(node, dict):\n        if 'subs' in node and node['subs']: # if 'subs' is not empty\n            for sub in node['subs']:\n                yield from get_deepest_objects(sub) # recurse into 'subs'\n        else:\n            yield node # 'subs' is empty, this is a deepest object\n\nfor obj in get_deepest_objects(data):\n    print(yaml.dump(obj, default_flow_style=False))\n```\n\nRunning this script would print:\n\n```yaml\nid: g\nX: h\nsubs: []\n```\n\nThis is the object that does not have any further nested 'subs', making it the most deeply nested object. It's being printed as it appears in the YAML file. If there were more such objects, they would be separated by newlines, fulfilling the requirements of the problem statement.\n\nDo note that you'll need to handle errors and exceptions appropriately in a production-level code.
