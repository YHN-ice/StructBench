        "To get the answer from the file, you first need to parse the YAML file. This can be done using a programming language library that supports YAML parsing, such as PyYAML for Python or js-yaml for JavaScript. \n\nHere is an example of how you would do this in Python:\n\n1. Import the required library: `import yaml`\n\n2. Open the YAML file and load its content: \n\n    ```python\n    with open('file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n        data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n    ```\n\n3. Traverse the loaded data to find the object with id \"b\". The traversal could be done recursively, as the structure is hierarchical, and the object could be on any level of the hierarchy.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_object(data, target_id):\n        if data.get('id') == target_id:\n            return data\n        for sub in data.get('subs', []):\n            result = find_object(sub, target_id)\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n        return None\n\n    obj_b = find_object(data, \"b\")\n    ```\n\n4. After getting the object with id \"b\", we can then extract its content.\n\n    ```python\n    excerpt = yaml.dump(obj_b)\n    print(excerpt)\n    ```\n\nThis would yield:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"b\"\nY: i,\nsubs: \n- id: \"c\"\n  X: h,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"d\"\n    W: g,\n    subs: []\n  - id: \"e\"\n    V: f,\n    U: e,\n    subs: []\n- id: \"f\"\n  T: d,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"g\"\n    S: c,\n    R: b,\n    subs: []\n  - id: \"h\"\n    Q: a,\n    subs: []\n```\n\nThis is the exact excerpt from the original YAML file pertaining to the object with id \"b\".\n\nNote that in a real-world scenario, you would need to handle potential errors and edge cases, such as the file not existing, the file not being valid YAML, the specified id not existing in the file, etc."
