Understanding and resolving these references might be necessary to get the full picture of the data.\n\n6. **Inclusion of External Files or References**: Sometimes, YAML files can contain references to external files or include statements that pull in content from other sources. These might not be directly visible in the file itself.\n\n7. **Comments**: While comments are useful for humans, they are ignored by parsers.

        "To extract the information of an object with id 'c' from the given YAML file, you need to understand the structure of the file. In YAML, collections are represented by sequences (also known as arrays or lists) and mappings (hashes or dictionaries). Here, `subs` is a sequence of mappings where each mapping represents an object.\n\nEach object mapping starts with the key `id` and its corresponding value. The other keys in the mapping represent attributes of the object.\n\nIn this file, objects can be nested within other objects using the `subs` key.
