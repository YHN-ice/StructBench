        "To answer the question: \"What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?\", we need to traverse the YAML file in a depth-first manner, meaning we will dig deep into each path before going to the other paths. In this particular scenario, we are looking for objects that don't have any more nested lists or dicts, meaning they are at the deepest level of nesting.\n\nHere's an algorithm to get the answer from the YAML file:\n\n1. Initialise a stack (or a list with similar functionality) with the root object (the first object \"a\" in this case) of the YAML file.\n2. Pop an object from the stack. If this object has a \"subs\" field with one or more items, push these items onto the stack. If it doesn't, print out or store this object as it is one of the most deeply nested ones.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the stack is empty.\n\nIn Python, you could use a package like PyYAML or ruamel.yaml to load and parse the YAML file. This will give you a native Python representation (like a list or dictionary) of the YAML data that you can easily work with.\n\nHere is how it looks in Python using recursion:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\ndef find_deepest_objects(yaml_object):\n    # Base case: If yaml_object is the most deeply nested object, print or return it\n    if len(yaml_object['subs']) == 0:\n            print(yaml_object)\n    # Recursive case: If yaml_object has 'subs', recursively apply function to each sub-object\n    else:\n        for sub_object in yaml_object['subs']:\n            find_deepest_objects(sub_object)\n\n# Load YAML file into Python dictionary\nwith open('file.yaml') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n\n# Find and print most deeply nested objects\nfind_deepest_objects(data)\n```\n\nThis code will print out all the most deeply nested objects as they appear in the YAML file.
