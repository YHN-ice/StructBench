        "The question asks for the height of the root node, which can be interpreted as the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf nodes. In this case, the height is defined as the maximum depth of any leaf node. \n\nTo solve this problem, the first step would be to create a tree structure from the provided file. Each line in the file can be seen as a directed edge from one node to another. You can create a dictionary where the keys are parent nodes and the values are lists of their respective children.\n\nHere is a high-level pseudocode on how to approach this problem:\n\n```\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary/tree: tree = {}\n2. For each line in the file:\n      Split the line on '->' to get parent and child\n      If parent is not in tree, add parent to tree with an empty list as value\n      Append child to parent's list in tree\n3. Define a recursive function 'max_depth' to compute the maximum depth of any node:\n      If node has no children (i.e., node is not in tree), return 0 \n      Otherwise, return 1 plus the maximum of 'max_depth' applied to all children\n4. The height of the root node is 'max_depth' applied to root\n```\n\nOnce you have created your tree, you can then traverse it to find out its height. There are various strategies for this, but a Depth-First Search (DFS) could be an efficient way, where you start from the root and explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n\nThe depth of each node can be found recursively by adding 1 to the maximum depth of its children. The base of recursion will be when a leaf node (a node with no children) is encountered, in which case its depth is 0.\n\nFinally, make sure to handle potential errors and edge cases, for example if the file does not exist, cannot be read, or if it contains cycles."
