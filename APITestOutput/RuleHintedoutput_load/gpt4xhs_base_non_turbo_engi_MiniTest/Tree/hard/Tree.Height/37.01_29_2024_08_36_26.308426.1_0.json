        "To answer the question, \"What is the height of the root node, i.e., the number of edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf nodes?\" based on the given file, you would need to parse the file into a tree data structure. The file appears to represent a tree structure, where each line indicates a parent-child relationship between nodes, denoted as \"parent->child\".\n\nHere are some steps to derive an answer from the file:\n\n1. **Reading the File**: Open the file in reading mode and read line by line. \n\n2. **Parsing Nodes and Edges**: For each line, split the line at \"->\" to get the parent-child pairs. This can be done using string splitting methods available in most programming languages.\n\n3. **Building the Tree**: Using a suitable data structure (like an adjacency list for a graph), you can construct the tree based on these parent-child pairs.\n\n4. **Finding the Root**: The root of the tree is the node that doesn't appear in any child position. You can find this by creating a set of all nodes and removing any node that appears as a child, leaving only the root.\n\n5. **Calculating the Height**: Starting from the root node, perform depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) traversal to find the farthest leaf node, keeping track of the maximum depth reached. This will give you the height of the tree.\n\nSo, in this case, after parsing and building the tree, if we perform BFS or DFS and find the maximum depth or height reached from node 'w' (assuming 'w' is root), we get 7. This means there are 7 edges in the longest path from root node 'w' to any leaf nodes. Hence, the height of root node 'w' is 7.\n\nPotential obstacles during this process could include an incorrectly formatted file, difficulty parsing parent-child relationships, or large file size causing performance issues. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes all names of nodes are unique, and there's only one root in the tree. If these assumptions are not true, additional steps will be needed to correctly identify individual nodes and roots."
