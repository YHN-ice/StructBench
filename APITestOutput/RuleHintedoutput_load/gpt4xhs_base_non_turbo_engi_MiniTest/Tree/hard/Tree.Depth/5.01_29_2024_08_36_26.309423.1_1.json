        "To solve this problem, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. First, you need to understand the syntax of the provided file. From the given information, we can see that each line of the file represents a parent-child relationship between two nodes in a tree-like structure. Each line is structured as parent->child. \n\n2. Given this understanding, the question is asking for the depth of a particular node (\"nk\") in this tree structure. The root is at depth 0, and each layer of children adds 1 to the depth. \n\n3. You would start by creating a dictionary or a similar data structure to represent the tree. Each key-value pair in the dictionary would represent a node and its parent. This could be done by parsing each line in the file and splitting it at the \"->\" symbol.\n\n4. Once you have created your dictionary, you can calculate the depth of any node by counting the number of ancestors it has. Starting from the target node \"nk\", you would use your dictionary to find its parent, then find that node's parent, and so on, until you reach the root node. Each step represents one unit of depth.\n\n5. The depth of the target node \"nk\" is thus represented by the number of steps it took to reach the root.\n\n6. In this particular example, following these steps would give you an answer of 7 for the depth of node \"nk\". \n\nNote: This approach assumes that the file contains a well-formed tree and that all nodes have only one parent.
