        "To answer the question, we need to trace the path from the root node to the target node in the given file. This file appears to have a tree structure where each line represents a connection between two nodes.

For each line, split the line into a parent node and a child node at the arrow \"->\". \n\n2. **Build a Tree Structure**: From the parsed data, build a tree or a hierarchical data structure.
