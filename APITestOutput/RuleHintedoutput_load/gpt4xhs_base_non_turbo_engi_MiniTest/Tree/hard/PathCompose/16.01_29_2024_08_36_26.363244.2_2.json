        "To find the path from the root node to the node 'lk', you can implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree structures.

Create an empty stack and push the root node into it.\n2. While the stack is not empty, do\n   - Pop a node from the stack. If the node is 'lk', then return the path to 'lk'.\n   - Otherwise, for each node connected to the current node, push it into the stack.\n\nIn Python, you could implement this as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_path(graph, start, end, path=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == end:\n        return path\n    if start not in graph:\n        return None\n    for node in graph[start]:\n        if node not in path:\n            newpath = find_path(graph, node, end, path)\n            if newpath: return newpath\n    return None\n\ngraph = {}\nwith open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        nodes = line.strip().split('->')\n        if nodes[0] in graph:\n            graph[nodes[0]].append(nodes[1])\n        else:\n            graph[nodes[0]] = [nodes[1]]\n\nprint(\"->\".join(find_path(graph, 'v', 'lk')))\n```\n\nNote that this code assumes that 'file.txt' contains the tree structure and that the tree is directed and acyclic (i.e., it does not contain cycles).\n\nThis code works by reading the file line by line and constructing a graph data structure (a dictionary where the keys are nodes and the values are lists of adjacent nodes).
