        "To answer the question \"What is the depth of node tb?\", we first need to understand the tree structure represented in the file. The file appears to be describing a tree structure where each line represents a parent-child relationship between two nodes, denoted as \"parent->child\".\n\nWe would have to traverse the file and put it into a more manageable data structure such as a dictionary or a custom tree data structure. For example, using Python, we could create a dictionary where each key-value pair represents a node and its parent. This can be done by iterating through each line in the file, splitting it based on the \"->\" operator and storing the result in the dictionary.\n\nOnce we have this dictionary, we find the path from the root to the node 'tb'. Since we know from the question that 'e' is our root node, we iterate from node 'tb' backwards using our dictionary until we get to 'e' and keep count of how many steps it took to get there. This count is the depth of 'tb'.\n\nFor instance, in Python:\n\n```python\ndef compute_depth(file, start_node):\n    parent_map = {}\n    for line in file:\n        parent, child = line.split('->')\n        parent_map[child.strip()] = parent.strip()\n\n    depth = 0\n    while start_node != 'e':\n        start_node = parent_map[start_node]\n        depth += 1\n    return depth\n\nprint(compute_depth(file, 'tb'))\n```\n\nIn this case, the output would be 3, which is the depth of node 'tb'. \n\nNote: The above solution assumes that the tree is well-formed and every node (except root) has a unique parent that appears before it in the file, and there is only one root (node without a parent). This method may not be sufficient if these assumptions do not hold true or if the tree's format changes."
