        "To answer the question \"What is the depth of node mc?\", we will have to parse the file and build a tree model. Here's a simple step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialize a Dictionary**: Start by initializing an empty dictionary to store each node and its depth.\n\n2. **Parse the File**: Read each line of the file. Each line represents a parent-child relationship with the format 'parent->child'. Split each line on '->' to obtain the parent and child nodes.\n\n3. **Build the Tree and Store Depth**: Add the root node to your dictionary with a depth of 0. For each line, if the parent node already exists in your dictionary, add the child node to your dictionary with a depth of parent's depth + 1. If the parent node does not exist, you will need to traverse back until you find a node that is already existing in your dictionary and calculate the depth accordingly.\n\n4. **Answer the Question**: Look up the depth of 'mc' in your dictionary and return it as the answer.\n\nThis method assumes that the file is properly formatted and there are no cycles in the tree (i.e., it's a Directed Acyclic Graph). If there are cycles or formatting issues, additional error handling may be required.\n\nIt's important to note that this approach requires one full pass through the file to build the dictionary, making it quite efficient even for large files. However, if the tree is extremely deep or has many branches, memory usage could become a concern."
