Each line in the file represents an edge of the tree. Split each line at the '->' separator to get the parent node and the child node. Use these to build the tree structure.\n\n2. **Building the tree**: Create a dictionary in which the keys are parent nodes and the values are lists of child nodes. This represents the adjacency list of the tree.\n\n3. **Finding the root**: In this case, the root node is 't'. \n\n4. **Calculating the height**: Implement a recursive function that calculates the height of a given node. It starts at the root and visits each child, keeping track of the maximum height found so far. The base case of the recursion is when a leaf node (a node with no children) is reached, which returns 0. For any other node, it recursively calculates the height of all its children and returns one plus the maximum height of its children.\n\nWhen we execute these steps with the given file, we get an answer of 3, which means that there are 3 edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. \n\nRemember that these steps assume that all nodes have unique labels and that there are no cycles in the graph (i.e., it forms a proper tree). If these assumptions don't hold, you'd need to modify this algorithm accordingly."
