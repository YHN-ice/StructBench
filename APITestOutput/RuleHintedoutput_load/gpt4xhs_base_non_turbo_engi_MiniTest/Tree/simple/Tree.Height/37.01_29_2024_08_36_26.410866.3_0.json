        "To answer the question \"What is the height of the root node, i.e., the number of edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf nodes?\", we need to parse the given file and translate it into a tree data structure. \n\nThe provided file seems to represent a tree where each line describes a parent-child relationship using '->'. The node before '->' is the parent and the node after is the child.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to get the answer:\n\n1. **Parsing**: Parse the file line by line, splitting each line at '->' to get parent and child nodes. This will give us the hierarchy of the tree.\n\n2. **Tree Construction**: Create a tree data structure where each node has a height. The root node has the highest height. For each child, assign a height which is one less than its parent.\n\n3. **Traversal**: Traverse the tree starting from the root node and follow each path to its leaf nodes. Keep track of the height of each node visited.\n\n4. **Find Maximum Height**: The height of the root node will be the maximum height encountered during traversal.\n\nIn this case, the root node is 'h', and by parsing the file, constructing the tree, and traversing it, one would find that the longest path from 'h' to any leaf node is of length 3 (e.g., h->i->j->k). Hence, the answer is 3. \n\nAs you can see, once you are able to parse and construct the tree correctly, answering such questions becomes straightforward. However, keep in mind that this process can be complex for large files or more complicated queries due to factors like those mentioned earlier."
