        "The given file represents a tree data structure. In this file, each line represents an edge between two nodes in the format \"parent->child\". The root node of the tree, from which all other nodes descend, is 'v'. The height of a node in a tree is the number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf. A leaf is a node with no children and is of height 0.\n\nTo find the height of the root node, we need to find the longest path from the root node 'v' to any of its descendant leaf nodes. The length of this path will give us the height of the root node.\n\nWe can start by creating a dictionary to represent the tree, where the keys are parent nodes and the values are lists of child nodes. For example, from the first few lines of the file, we would create the following entries in our dictionary:\n```\ntree = {\n    \"v\": [\"w\", \"rb\", \"mc\", \"hd\"],\n    \"w\": [\"x\", \"cb\", \"hb\", \"mb\"],\n    \"x\": [\"y\", \"z\", \"ab\", \"bb\"],\n    ...\n}\n```\nNext, we could use a function to recursively traverse the tree from the root node 'v', keeping track of the longest path we've found so far. At each node, we would call the function on its children and add 1 to our path length. If a node has no children (i.e., it's a leaf), we return 0.\n\nFinally, we return the maximum length found among all paths from the root to a leaf. In this case, that answer is 3. This represents the longest path from 'v' to any leaf node (in particular, nodes 'yb', 'zb', 'ac', 'bc', 'ic', 'jc', 'kc', 'lc', 'yc', 'zc', 'ad', 'bd', 'dd', 'ed', 'fd', 'gd', 'yd', 'zd', 'ae', and 'be'). This corresponds to the height of the root node in the tree."
