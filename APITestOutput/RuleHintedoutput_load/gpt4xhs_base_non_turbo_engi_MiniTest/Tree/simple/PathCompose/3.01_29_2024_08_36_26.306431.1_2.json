        "To answer the given question using the provided file, you would need to parse the file to build a tree data structure. The \"->\" symbol signifies a parent-child relationship between nodes.

A Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be used. \n\nStarting from the root node, which in this case is \"v\", the search will follow paths down the tree until it reaches the node \"gd\".
