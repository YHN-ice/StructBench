        "The answer to the question \"What is the path from the root node to the node n\" from the given file can be obtained by adopting the following steps:\n\n1. **Reading and Parsing the File**: The first step is to read in the file and parse each line. Each line in this file represents a relationship between two nodes, denoted as 'parent->child'. In Python, you could use the built-in `open()` function to read in the file, and then use a `for` loop to iterate through each line.\n\n2. **Building the Tree**: As each line is parsed, you can use this information to construct the tree. This can be achieved by using a dictionary data structure, where each key-value pair represents a node and its child nodes.\n\n3. **Finding the Path**: With the tree constructed, you can then find the path from the root node to node 'n'. You could do this with a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Start from the root node and explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n   \nBy executing these steps, you will get the answer: h->i->j->n. \n\nNote that this method assumes that all nodes are unique and that there is a direct path from the root node to every other node. If this is not the case, additional error checking and data processing may be required."
