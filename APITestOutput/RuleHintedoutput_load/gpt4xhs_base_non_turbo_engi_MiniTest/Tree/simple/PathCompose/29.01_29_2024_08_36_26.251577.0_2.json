        "To answer the question \"What is the path from the root node to the node dc\", you need to trace the path in the provided file. The file appears to represent a tree structure, where each line indicates a direct relationship between nodes in the format parent_node->child_node.\n\nHere are the steps to find the answer:\n\n1. Parse the file: Read the file line by line and parse each line to extract the parent and child nodes. A map or dictionary data structure can be used to store this information for easy lookup in subsequent steps.\n\n2. Identify the root node: In this case, 'e' appears to be the root node as it is at the start of the tree structure and has no preceding node.\n\n3. Traverse the tree: Starting at the root node, follow the child nodes as directed by the question. In this case, you would start at 'e', then move to 'vb', then to 'bc', and finally to 'dc'.\n\n4. Construct the path: As you traverse the tree, construct the path by adding each node followed by '->' until you reach 'dc'. \n\n5. Output Answer: The final path from root node 'e' to node 'dc' is 'e->vb->bc->dc'.\n\nAs mentioned in potential difficulties, ensure that your parsing code can handle any complexities or anomalies in the file format, and that it can efficiently process a file of this size. Additionally, if there are any inconsistencies or ambiguities in how the data is represented, make sure your code can handle these or at least fail gracefully.
