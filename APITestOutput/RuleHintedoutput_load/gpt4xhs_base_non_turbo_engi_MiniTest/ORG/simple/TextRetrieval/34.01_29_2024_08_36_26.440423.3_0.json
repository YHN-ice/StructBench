A deep understanding of this structure is necessary to navigate and extract information accurately.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Data**: ORG files are hierarchical, meaning that information is often nested within different levels of headings. It's important to understand the relationship between these levels to provide accurate answers.\n\n3. **Special Syntax**: ORG mode supports special syntax for various elements like TODO items, tags, properties, timestamps, and more. Interpreting these correctly is crucial for understanding the context of the information.\n\n4. **Embedded Code Blocks**: ORG files can contain embedded source code blocks in various programming languages. Parsing and possibly executing these code blocks might be necessary to answer questions that depend on their output.\n\n5. **Link Resolution**: Links within ORG files can point to external sources or other parts of the same document. Resolving these links appropriately is important for comprehensiveness.\n\n6. **Dynamic Content**: Some ORG files might include dynamic content that is generated on-the-fly, such as the results of executing embedded code or macros. Handling dynamic content could pose a challenge.\n\n7. **File Size and Complexity**: Large ORG files with complex structures can make it difficult to quickly locate relevant information.\n\n8. **Natural Language Processing**: Since questions can be posed in natural language, accurately interpreting the question and mapping it to the structured content of the ORG file requires natural language processing capabilities.\n\n9. **Metadata Interpretation**: Metadata like tags and properties may carry important context that influences the answer to a question.\n\n10. **Version Inconsistencies**: If the ORG file syntax has evolved over time, there may be inconsistencies or deprecated elements that could affect parsing.\n\n11. **Encoding Issues**: Ensuring that text encoding is correctly handled is essential for reading and interpreting the content accurately.\n\n12. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is necessary to deal with any unexpected formats or corrupted parts of the file.\n\nOvercoming these obstacles requires a combination of parsing algorithms specifically tailored for ORG files, natural language processing for understanding questions, and potentially some level of artificial intelligence for handling ambiguous cases."

Therefore, our task is to extract all such texts from the file.\n\nHere is a step-by-step process of how to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Read the File**: Open and read the file. This can be done using file handling functions in many programming languages. For instance, in Python, we can use `open()` function to open a file and `read()` function to read its contents.\n\n2. **Find Bold Texts**: Look for texts that are enclosed in asterisks (*). This can be done using regular expressions (RegEx). A simple RegEx pattern like `*([^*]+)*` will match any text that is inside asterisks.\n\n3. **Extract Bold Texts**: Use the RegEx pattern to find all matches in the file content. Most programming languages provide functions to search for RegEx matches in a string. For instance, in Python, we can use `findall()` function of the `re` module.\n\n4. **Print Texts**: After extracting all bold texts, print them separated by newline characters (\\n).
