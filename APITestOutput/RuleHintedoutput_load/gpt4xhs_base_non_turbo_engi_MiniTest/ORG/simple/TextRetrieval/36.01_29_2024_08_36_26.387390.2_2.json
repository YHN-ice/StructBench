Here are some of them:\n\n1. **Complex File Structure**: ORG files can have complex hierarchical structures with nested sections, which may make it difficult to navigate and locate the relevant information.\n\n2. **Special Syntax**: ORG files use a specific syntax for elements such as headlines, lists, links, TODOs, tags, and properties. Understanding this syntax is crucial to interpret the content correctly.\n\n3. **Metadata**: ORG files can contain metadata like timestamps, priorities, and scheduling information. Parsing and interpreting these correctly is essential for accurate answers.\n\n4. **Dynamic Content**: ORG files can include dynamic blocks or embedded code that generate content when the file is processed by an ORG mode-aware tool. This dynamic content may not be present in the raw file and will require evaluation or interpretation.\n\n5. **Links and References**: ORG files often contain internal and external links, as well as references to other parts of the file or to external resources. Understanding these links and how they relate to the content is necessary to provide context for answers.\n\n6. **Customization and Extensions**: Users can customize ORG mode with their own macros, shortcuts, and plugins. This may introduce non-standard elements into the org file that are not immediately recognizable.\n\n7. **Markup for Formatting**: Text formatting in ORG files (like bold, italic, underline) is achieved through specific markup. It's important to parse this correctly so that the textual meaning is preserved.\n\n8. **Tables and Spreadsheets**: ORG files can include complex tables and even spreadsheet-like functionalities. Interpreting these correctly may require understanding of table syntax and formulas used within them.\n\n9. **Ambiguity in Natural Language Questions**: The questions themselves might contain ambiguities or require contextual understanding that goes beyond the textual information in the ORG file.\n\n10. **Version Differences**: Different versions of ORG mode may have slightly different features or syntax, which could affect how the file needs to be parsed.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser must be well-equipped to handle the ORG mode syntax, understand the structure of the document, evaluate dynamic content when necessary, and provide answers that take into account the proper context within the file."

        "In the given problem, we are required to extract all included image files from the org file content and print their names separated by '\\n'. \n\nThe first step is understanding the syntax of how an image file is represented in an org file. In this case, the image filename is surrounded by double square brackets like so: `[[imagefile.jpg]]`. \n\nNext, we can scan through each line in the org file. For each line, we identify if it contains an image file name within square brackets. This can be done using a programming language that supports regular expressions, like Python or JavaScript, and matching lines to the pattern `[[*.jpg]]`. \n\nWhen we find a match, we extract the image file name from within the square brackets. This can be done by splitting the line based on '[[', ']]' and then selecting the part that contains '.jpg'. \n\nAfter extracting the image file name, we add it to a list. \n\nFinally, after going through all lines in the file, we print all image file names from our list, separated by '\\n'. This would provide all image file names included in the org file.\n\nHere's how it might look in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_image_files(file_content):\n    image_files = []\n    for line in file_content:\n        match = re.search('[[.*.jpg]]', line)\n        if match:\n            image_filename = match.group().split('[[', ']]')[1]\n            image_files.append(image_filename)\n    return '\\n'.join(image_files)\n```\n\nRemember that this is a simple example. The regex pattern might need to be adjusted depending on your exact requirements and the specific syntax of your org files. Also, this assumes that all image files are .jpg files, which may not always be the case. You might need to adjust your code to handle other image file types."
