        "To extract all included image files and print their names, you would need to:\n\n1. **Open the file**: Use a file reading module or function in your programming language of choice to open and read the content of the file.\n\n2. **Parse the file**: Implement a parsing logic that can accurately interpret the ORG mode syntax. This could be done using regular expressions or by using a parsing library if available.\n\n3. **Search for Image References**: Look for patterns that indicate an image reference. In this example, it seems images are included using double square brackets ([[ ]]). Any text within these could be considered as a potential image file reference.\n\n4. **Filter by File Type**: Images usually have specific file extensions such as .jpeg, .png, .svg etc. Filter the extracted potential image references by these extensions to get actual image filenames.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Print out the filenames of the images, each separated by a newline (\\n).\n\nYou would need to handle potential errors and exceptions, such as the file not existing, not having read permissions, syntax errors in the file, or no image references being present.
