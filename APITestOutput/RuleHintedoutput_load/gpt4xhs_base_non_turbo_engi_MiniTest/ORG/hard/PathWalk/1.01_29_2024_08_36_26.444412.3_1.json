If you are not familiar with this format, it could be challenging to parse effectively.\n\n2. **Complex Hierarchies**: ORG files often contain nested structures and hierarchical data.

Knowing how to handle and interpret this metadata is crucial for understanding the context and relevance of the information within the file.\n\n4. **Dynamic Content**: Some ORG files might include dynamic content such as links, code blocks that can be executed, or macros. Parsing and interpreting this content correctly may be complicated.\n\n5. **Handling Markup**: ORG files support rich text markup (like bold, italic, underline, etc.). When extracting information, you may need to consider whether to retain or remove these formatting marks based on the requirements of the task.\n\n6. **Embedded or Linked Content**: The file might contain links or references to external files or resources, making it difficult to access all necessary information without retrieving additional data from these external sources.\n\n7. **Encoding and Character Set Issues**: If the file uses a non-standard encoding or contains special characters, it could pose difficulties in reading and interpreting the data correctly.\n\n8. **Tooling and Libraries**: Depending on the tooling or libraries available for parsing ORG files, you may encounter limitations in what can be automatically extracted or interpreted without manual intervention or custom scripting.\n\n9. **Version Differences**: If the ORG file was created with a different version of the software than what is currently being used to parse it, there might be differences in features or syntax that could affect the interpretation of the data.\n\n10. **Human Error**: Manual errors in the file creation—such as incorrect formatting, typos, or inconsistent use of conventions—can lead to misinterpretation of the data when parsed programmatically.\n\nTo ensure accurate extraction of information, a parser must be able to handle these challenges effectively or else it must be designed with fallback"
