Understanding the relationship between sections and subsections is critical for accurate information extraction.\n\n3. **Metadata**: ORG files can contain metadata like tags, timestamps, properties, etc. These need to be interpreted correctly to answer questions that depend on them.\n\n4. **Dynamic Content**: ORG files can include dynamic content like spreadsheets or code blocks that are meant to be evaluated within Emacs. Since we're parsing the file statically, we might not be able to handle these correctly.\n\n5. **Links and References**: There might be references to other parts of the file or external resources which need to be resolved to understand the context fully.\n\n6. **File Size and Complexity**: Large files with complex structures may pose performance issues and make it difficult to quickly locate relevant information.\n\n7. **Text Formatting**: Emphasis, code snippets, and other text formatting need to be considered when parsing text as they might convey additional meaning.\n\n8. **Embedded Content**: If the file contains embedded images, videos, or other media, these cannot be parsed in the same way as text and may require special consideration.\n\n9. **Special Blocks**: Org mode supports special blocks like #+BEGIN_SRC for source code or #+BEGIN_QUOTE for quotations. These may have different parsing rules.\n\n10. **Tables**: Org mode supports table creation, which may have headers, formulas, and alignment that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, one would likely need a parser that understands the ORG file format's syntax and structure.
