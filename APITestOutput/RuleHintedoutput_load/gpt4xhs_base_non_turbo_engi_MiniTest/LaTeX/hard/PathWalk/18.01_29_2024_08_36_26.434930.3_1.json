Parsing mathematical expressions and symbols correctly might be challenging, especially if the question requires interpreting or evaluating these expressions.\n\n3. **Cross-referencing:** LaTeX documents often make use of labels and references to link different parts of a document. Understanding these links and finding related content might be necessary to answer questions that depend on context provided elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Figures and Tables:** Information contained within figures, tables, or other floats might be crucial to answering a question. Extracting and interpreting this data can be tricky, particularly if it relies on external files or is generated by complex LaTeX commands.\n\n5. **Conditional Content:** LaTeX allows for conditional compilation using packages like `ifthen` or commands like `\\newif`.
