For instance, commands for formatting or including figures and tables could be nested within each other, making it difficult to extract meaningful content.\n\n2. **Custom Commands and Macros:** LaTeX allows users to define their own macros and commands. Without knowledge of these custom definitions, it can be difficult to interpret the content correctly.\n\n3. **Conditional Compilation:** LaTeX documents can include conditional statements that change the output based on certain conditions (e.g., using the `\\if` command). Parsing such conditions correctly could be necessary to get the right content.\n\n4. **External Files:** LaTeX documents can reference external files using commands like `\\input` or `\\include`. Without access to these files, it might be impossible to fully understand the document structure or content.\n\n5. **Math Environment:** If the LaTeX file contains mathematical expressions, they could be written in a specific math environment that uses symbols and notation different from regular text, requiring specialized parsing rules.\n\n6. **Cross-Referencing:** LaTeX supports cross-referencing within a document, which means that labels and references might need to be resolved to make sense of the document content.\n\n7. **Comments:** Content within comments (marked by `%`) is not intended for output in the final document, but it may contain important information about the document structure or notes from the author.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues:** The character encoding of the LaTeX file might not match the expected encoding, leading to issues when reading special characters or symbols.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one needs to have a good understanding of the LaTeX syntax and possibly access to a well-implemented LaTeX parser or tool that can interpret complex LaTeX documents.

        "To answer the question, we need to write a script to parse the LaTeX file and extract all the bold texts. In LaTeX, there are multiple ways to make text bold but in our file, bold texts are made using \\textbf{} command.\n\nHere is a Python script to extract bold text from a given string:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_bold_texts(input_string):\n    pattern = r'\\\\textbf\\{(.*?)\\}'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, input_string)\n    return \"\\n\".join(matches)\n\ninput_string = \"\"\"\nl\nnob nob wake nob \\textbf{jargon}dentist monkey perish groot\n\\section{m}\noops nob wake nob dentist monkey pe\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{cf.png}rish groot\n\\subsection{n}\nperish nob wake nob dentist monkey pe\\textbf{kangaroo}rish groot\n\"\"\"\n\nbold_texts = extract_bold_texts(input_string)\nprint(bold_texts)\n```\n\nThis script works by using the `re` module (regular expressions) in Python to find all occurrences of the `\\textbf{}` command in the provided LaTeX string. The regular expression pattern `\\textbf\\{(.*?)\\}` matches any text that is enclosed in `\\textbf{}`. \n\nThen, we use `re.findall` command to extract all the matches and return them as a list. We use \"\\n\".join(matches) to join all the matches with a new line ('\\n') and return the result.\n\nThis script will print:\n```\njargon\nkangaroo\n```\n\nIn this case, the extracted bold texts from the given LaTeX file string are \"jargon\" and \"kangaroo\"."
