Here's an example of how to do this in Python:\n\n```\nimport re\n\n# Open the file\nwith open('file.tex', 'r') as file:\n    data = file.read()\n\n# Find all instances of bold text\nbold_texts = re.findall(r'\\\\textbf\\{(.*?)\\}', data)\n\n# Print the extracted texts\nfor text in bold_texts:\n    print(text)\n```\nThis code will print all texts enclosed in \\textbf{...}, separated by a new line.\n\n2. **LaTeX Parser**: For more complex files or to handle some of the other LaTeX features mentioned above, we might need to use a LaTeX parser. There are several libraries available for different programming languages that can parse LaTeX documents and provide an object-oriented representation of the document.\n\nNote that with either approach, you may still need to handle nested commands (like \\textbf{\\emph{...}}), custom commands, and mathematical expressions separately, depending on the specifics of your LaTeX document."
