        "To get the answer from the file, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Read the File:** Open and read the file using a programming language that can handle file I/O operations. This could be Python, Java, C++, etc.\n\n2. **Understand the File Structure:** The file appears to be in tab-separated format with headers on the top. Each record is associated with a 'primeKey'. Two types of records are represented, personal details and employment details; these are tied together using the 'primeKey'.\n\n3. **Parse the File:** Parse the file by splitting each line into individual fields. This can be done using standard library functions in many programming languages.\n\n4. **Map primeKey to Records:** Create a dictionary or map where the 'primeKey' is the key and the value is the corresponding record. The record could be a tuple or an object containing all fields for a person.\n\n5. **Answer the Question:** To answer a question like \"What is the height of record with primeKey c\", look up 'c' in your dictionary/map and retrieve the 'height' field from the corresponding record.\n\nNote: There is also potential for data inconsistency. For example, if a 'primeKey' is repeated with different attribute values, you would need to decide how to handle such cases (e.g., only keep the first occurrence, keep the last, throw an error, etc.).
