        "To get the answer from the file, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the File**: Use a file reading function in a programming language like Python, R, Java or even Excel, to load the file into a viewable format. If the file is a standard format like CSV or XLSX, there are built-in functions in these languages that can load data from these files.\n\n2. **Parse the File**: You then need to parse the file in order to extract the desired information. In this case, the file seems to be in a tabular format with each row representing a record and each column representing a different attribute of that record.\n\n3. **Search for the Key**: You will have to search the 'primeKey' column for 'g'. \n\n4. **Find the Answer**: Once you find the row with the 'primeKey' equal to 'g', you would look at the corresponding 'location' column to get your answer: 'IL'. \n\nNote: The complication in this particular case is that information for each record seems to be spread across two separate rows in two sections of the file, so you'd need to match these up based on their primeKey to get a complete picture of each record. In this case, you'd first find 'g' in the first section, then find 'g' again in the second section to get the location. \n\nThis approach assumes that the 'primeKey' is unique and does not repeat in any other row, which is typically the case with key identifiers.
