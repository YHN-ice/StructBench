        "To answer the question \"How many people work with salary more than 922576?\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding File Format**: The file is in a tab-separated value (TSV) format. This is evident as the values are separated by tabs. There are two tables in the file, one for personal details and the other for job details, both linked by a common column 'primeKey'.\n\n2. **Parsing the Data**: We can parse this file using a programming language like Python or a tool that can read TSV files, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. In our case, we are interested in the 'salary' field of the second table.\n\n3. **Processing the Query**: After parsing the file, we need to make a count of all the people who have a salary greater than 922576. This involves traversing the parsed data, specifically the 'salary' field and incrementing a counter whenever we find a person who has a salary more than 922576.\n\n4. **Handling Ambiguities and Inconsistencies**: From the given data, there does not seem to be any ambiguity or inconsistency. However, if we encounter any ambiguous or inconsistent data, we should have a plan to handle it - this could involve skipping that data, reporting an error, or making an assumption based on the context.\n\n5. **Result**: The result will be a number representing how many people have a salary greater than 922576. In this case, from the given data, the answer is '0'.\n\nNote: Implementation of these steps would require programming skills or manual counting if using Excel/Google Sheets. Also, it is important to consider that this approach may need modifications if the data set is too large, or if there are changes in file format or inconsistencies in data."
