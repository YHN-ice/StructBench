        "To answer the question \"How many people work with salary more than 204201?\" from the given file:\n\nStep 1: Recognize the file format. The input file seems to be in a kind of tab-separated value (TSV) format with two tables. Note that the first table contains information about the person (gender, age, etc.), while the second table contains information about the person's employment status and salary.\n\nStep 2: Load the data from each table. You would use a parser designed to handle this type of file. In languages like Python, libraries such as pandas can help automate this process.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the tables into dataframes\nperson_df = pd.read_csv('person.txt', sep='\\t')\nemployment_df = pd.read_csv('employment.txt', sep='\\t')\n```\n\nStep 3: Merge the two tables based on the 'primeKey' column. This will allow us to directly compare a person's details with their employment details.\n\n```python\nmerged_df = pd.merge(person_df, employment_df, on='primeKey')\n```\n\nStep 4: Filter the merged table to include only those rows where the salary is more than 204201.\n\n```python\nhigh_salary_df = merged_df[merged_df['salary'] > 204201]\n```\n\nStep 5: Count the number of rows in the filtered table. This will give us the number of people with a salary more than 204201.\n\n```python\nnum_high_salary = high_salary_df.shape[0]\nprint(num_high_salary)\n```\n\nThe above steps assume that the file can be loaded into memory in its entirety. If the file is too large, you would need to use different techniques such as chunk processing or database storage. \n\nIn addition, this approach assumes that there are no missing values, inconsistencies, or errors in the data. In a real-world scenario, more thorough data cleaning and validation steps would likely be necessary."
