As the format appears to be a form of tab-delimited text, standard file reading techniques can be used. \n\n2. **Store the Information**: Once parsed, the data from both tables needs to be stored in a way that allows for easy access. One way to do this would be to use a data structure like a dictionary, with the `primeKey` as the key and the rest of the information in that row as the value.\n\n3. **Merge the Data**: Merge the two tables using `primeKey` as the common identifier.

For this specific question, you need to find the people who earn more than 230884. To do this, you would iterate over your data structure and count the number of people whose salary is more than 230884.\n\n5. **Answer the Question**: After analyzing, you should now have your answer: 6 people have salaries greater than 230884.\n\nAlways remember to handle data errors and exceptions properly to ensure the integrity of your result, and to use optimized algorithms for efficiency especially when dealing with large datasets."
