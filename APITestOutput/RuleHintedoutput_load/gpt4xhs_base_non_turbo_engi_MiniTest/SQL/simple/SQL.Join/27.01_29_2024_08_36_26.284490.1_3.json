        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in CA are taller than 180?\", you would need to combine information from both tables in the file. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Understand the File Format:** From the given file, we can see that it contains two tables, each with different columns. They are separated by newlines. Each table uses tab delimiters to separate values in each row.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data:** For our question, we are interested in the 'location', 'height', and 'primeKey' columns from both tables. \n\n3. **Parse the File:** Read through the file line by line. For each table, create a data structure (like a dictionary) where the 'primeKey' is the key, and the relevant data ('height' and 'location') are the values. \n\n4. **Link the Tables:** Once both tables have been parsed, we can link them using the 'primeKey'. We can look up the 'primeKey' from the first table in the second table to get the location. \n\n5. **Filter the Data:** Now, we want to filter this linked data structure to only include people who work in CA and are taller than 180.\n\n6. **Count the Results:** Finally, count the number of people who meet these criteria and return that count.\n\nThe given answer implies that there is only one person who works in CA and is taller than 180. This would be verified by following these steps and performing these operations on the given file.\n\nRemember, this process would be more complex with a larger or more complicated file structure. It's always important to fully understand the file's structure and content before attempting to parse it and retrieve information."
