        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in IL are taller than 159?\", we need to parse and analyze the file to extract and correlate the relevant data. Here is a step-by-step process:\n\n1. **File Reading**: Open the file in read mode. \n\n2. **Data Segregation**: As per the data in the file, it seems to be divided into two parts: \n    * Personal details (primeKey, gender, age, name, height, weight, color)\n    * Work details (primeKey, status, salary, company, location)\n   We would need to parse these two parts separately.\n\n3. **Data Parsing**: Parse the file line by line\n    * Parse the personal details section maintaining a dictionary with primeKey as the key and the rest of the data as a dictionary like {\"gender\":.., \"age\":.., \"name\":.., \"height\":.., \"weight\":.., \"color\":..}\n    * Parse the work details section by appending to each person's dictionary using primeKey as a reference. The end result for each person would look something like this: {\"gender\":.., \"age\":.., \"name\":.., \"height\":.., \"weight\":.., \"color\":.., \"status\":.., \"salary\":.., \"company\":.., \"location\":..}\n\n4. **Query Processing**: To answer the question:\n    * Filter out people who work in IL (location == \"IL\")\n    * From those people, count the ones who are taller than 159 (height > 159)\n\n5. **Result**: The count obtained after these steps would be the answer to the question.\n\nNote: This process assumes that the file structure remains the same and that the primeKey is unique and correctly matches between personal and work details. It also assumes that all heights are provided in the same unit (presumably centimeters)."
