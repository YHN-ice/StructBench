You will need to find entries where 'location' is 'WA' and 'height' is more than 154. \n\n4. **Count the Result**: Once you apply these filters, you will get rows of data that fulfill the condition. The number of these rows is the answer to your question.\n\nHowever, it is mentioned that the answer is 0 which implies that no person in this dataset works in WA and is taller than 154.
