        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in NY are taller than 171?\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the File: The first step is to parse the file correctly. The file appears to be a tab-delimited file with two separate tables. Each table uses `primeKey` as a unique identifier.\n\n2. Combine the Tables: Once the tables are parsed, combine them into a single table using `primeKey` as the joining key. This allows you to associate each person's height and work location.\n\n3. Filter by Location and Height: After combining the tables, filter the resultant table for rows where `location` is 'NY' and `height` is greater than 171.\n\n4. Count the Rows: Count the number of remaining rows after the filtration. This count gives you the number of people who work in NY and are taller than 171.\n\nIn this particular example case, there is no person who works in NY according to the given data in 'location' column. Therefore, given this data, the answer to the question is 0.\n\nRemember to handle any parsing errors or inconsistencies in the data gracefully - for example, if a row has a missing or non-numeric height value, skip that row and continue with the next one. If there are a large number of such errors, it might indicate a problem with the dataset that needs to be addressed at a higher level."
