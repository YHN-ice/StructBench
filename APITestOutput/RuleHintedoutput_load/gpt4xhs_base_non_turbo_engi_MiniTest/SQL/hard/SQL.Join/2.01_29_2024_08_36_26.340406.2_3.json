        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in IL are taller than 175?\", we would follow these general steps:\n\n1. Identify and parse the data tables: From the provided file, we can see two data tables - one containing individual demographic and physical characteristics (primeKey, gender, age, name, height, weight, color) and another with employment-related information (primeKey, status, salary, company, location). \n\n2. Understand the relationships between tables: The 'primeKey' column is common between both tables and can be used to link data between them. \n\n3. Select relevant data: We are interested in people who work in IL and are taller than 175. From the first table, we select individuals who are taller than 175 (height > 175). Similarly, from the second table, we choose those working in IL (location == 'IL')\n\n4. Merge the selected data: Using 'primeKey' as a linking key, we merge or join the two selected subsets of data. The result will be a table containing records of individuals who are taller than 175 and work in IL.\n\n5. Count the number of records: The final answer to the question would be the number of records in the merged table, which represents the number of people who meet both conditions.\n\nSpecific handling and parsing will depend on the actual format of the file. However, this general approach should work for most structured data files. Note that some of the obstacles mentioned earlier could still apply while working with this file and may need to be addressed accordingly."
