        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in GA are taller than 171?\", you would need to:\n\n1. Parse the file and extract the data. Since the file has a unique structure, it's important to note that the first part of the file contains information about individuals and the second part contains information about their employment.\n\n2. From the first portion of the file, for each individual, you would need to extract their 'primeKey' and 'height'. \n\n3. From the second portion of the file, you would need to extract the 'primeKey' and 'location' for each individual.\n\n4. Then, you would need to associate data from both portions of the file using each person's 'primeKey'. This step is crucial since people are identified by the same 'primeKey' across different sections of the file.\n\n5.
