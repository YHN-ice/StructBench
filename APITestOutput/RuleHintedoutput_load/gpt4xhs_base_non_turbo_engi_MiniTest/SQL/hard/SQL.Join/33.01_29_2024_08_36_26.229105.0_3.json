        "To answer the given question, you first need to understand that the file is divided into two tables. The first table contains attributes like gender, age, name, height, weight, color and the second table contains attributes like status, salary, company, location. The primeKey column is common in both tables and is used to link the data in both tables.\n\nSteps to get the answer from the file:\n\n1. Parse the file: First, identify the delimiter used in the file. In this case, it looks like a tab-separated value (TSV) file. Load the data using a suitable library that can handle TSV files, like pandas in Python. \n\n2. Merge the tables: After loading both tables into separate dataframes, you can merge them using the common column 'primeKey'. This will give you a single table where each row has all the information about a single person.\n\n3. Filter by location and height: Once the tables are merged, filter the resulting dataframe to include only those rows where 'location' is 'HI' and 'height' is more than '167'. The resulting dataframe will contain information about people who work in HI and are taller than 167.\n\n4. Count the number of rows: The number of rows in this final dataframe represents the number of people who work in HI and are taller than 167. \n\n5. Return this count as your answer. In this case, there's only one person who fits the criteria hence your answer would be '1'. \n\nRemember to handle any potential exceptions or errors in your code such as missing values or incorrect datatypes."
