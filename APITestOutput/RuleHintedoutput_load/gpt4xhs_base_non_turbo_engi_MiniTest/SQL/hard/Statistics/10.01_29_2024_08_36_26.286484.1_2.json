        "To answer the question \"How many people are female?\" from the given file, the approach would be as follows:\n\n1. **Read the file**: The first step is to read the file using a file reading method in the programming language of your choice. Depending on the format of the file, you could use built-in functions or libraries to handle this. For example, if you are using Python and the file is in CSV format, you can use the pandas library to read the file into a DataFrame.\n\n2. **Understand the data**: Look at the headers of the columns to understand what data is available. In this case, there's a column labeled 'gender' which indicates the gender of each person.\n\n3. **Filter the data**: Once you understand what each column represents, you can begin to filter data relevant to your question. Here, we want to know how many people are female. To do this, we create a condition that checks for 'female' in the 'gender' column.\n\n4. **Count the data**: After filtering the data to only include rows where 'gender' is 'female', we need to count these rows. This can be done using a counting function in your chosen programming language. For example, in Python pandas, we can use the `count()` function.\n\n5. **Return the result**: The result obtained from the count function would be the answer to our question, i.e., the number of females.\n\nIn Python, this would look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the file into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('file.csv')\n\n# Filter rows where 'gender' is 'female'\nfemales = df[df['gender'] == 'female']\n\n# Count these rows\nnum_females = females.count()\n\nprint(num_females)\n``` \n\nThis will print out the number of females, which according to the file provided in this case, is 8."
