        "To answer the question \"How many people work with salary more than 45500?\", the following steps can be undertaken:\n\n1. **Parsing the File**: The file is given in a tab-separated format, so you would have to read the file line by line and split each line into fields using the tab character as the delimiter.\n\n2. **Linking Related Records**: Notice that the data related to individuals (like gender, age, etc.) and their employment details (like status, salary, etc.) are given in separate lines, but they're linked by the 'primeKey' field. So, after parsing each line, you'd have to maintain a mapping of primeKey to its corresponding fields for both individuals and employment records.\n\n3. **Answering the Question**: Once the mapping is complete, you'd iterate over all employment records, convert the salary field to an integer, and check if it's greater than 45500. For each record where the condition is true, increment a counter. At the end of this process, the value of this counter will give you the number of people with a salary more than 45500.\n\nRemember that the above steps assume that the file is correctly formatted, the data is consistent and integral, and there are no memory constraints. In real-world scenarios, you'd have to add additional safeguards and checks for these potential issues."
