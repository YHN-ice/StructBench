        "To answer the question, \"How many people are female?\" from the given file, the following steps would be required:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: In this case, the gender data is relevant to the question. It's located in the second column of the first table in the file. \n\n2. **Parse the File**: Read the file and split each line into fields. Pay special attention to the syntax and format of the file, as well as any other unique characteristics (i.e., primeKey, gender, age, name, height, weight, color). \n\n3. **Filter Data**: Filter out the rows in which 'gender' is set to 'female'. This would involve creating a condition that checks if 'gender' equals 'female' for each row.\n\n4. **Count Instances**: Count the number of rows returned after filtering to give you the number of females. \n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to cater for instances where fields may be missing or incorrectly formatted.\n\nThe answer to this question would come from counting the rows where 'gender' equals 'female' in the first table in the file. It doesn't require data from the second table. \n\nPlease note that each step can face obstacles and difficulties as stated in sections 1-10 above. Make sure to handle these scenarios to ensure accurate and reliable results.  \n\nFor this example, there are 6 entries where 'gender' is marked as 'female', so the answer is 6."
