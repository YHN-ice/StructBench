If rows with the same primeKey (indicating they refer to the same person) have inconsistent or incomplete data across multiple entries, this can complicate the analysis.\n\n3. **Data Ambiguity:** Different rows with the same primeKey may have conflicting information, leading to ambiguity. This requires a method to resolve inconsistencies, such as prioritizing more recent entries or using additional context to determine which data is correct.\n\n4. **Large Volume of Data:** If the data table is very large, searching through it to find the relevant information can be time-consuming and computationally intensive.

The parser must be versatile enough to handle simple queries as well as more complex ones that involve multiple steps or conditions.\n\n7. **Understanding the Context:** Questions may rely on context that is not explicitly stated in the data table. The parser needs to have mechanisms for inferring context or accessing external information if needed.\n\nTo address these and other potential issues, a combination of data preprocessing, error-checking, and sophisticated querying mechanisms should be put in place to ensure accurate and efficient data retrieval and interpretation."

        "To answer the question \"What is the color of record with primeKey f\", you would have to look at the first data table. The data tables are arranged in rows and columns. The first row indicates the property names for each column. To find the color, you need to locate the row where the primeKey is \"f\" and then look at the value in the \"color\" column of that row. \n\nIn this case, you would first locate the row where primeKey is \"f\", which is \"f\tfemale\t34\tr\t197\t105\tblack\". Then, looking at the \"color\" column in this row, you can see that the color is \"black\".
