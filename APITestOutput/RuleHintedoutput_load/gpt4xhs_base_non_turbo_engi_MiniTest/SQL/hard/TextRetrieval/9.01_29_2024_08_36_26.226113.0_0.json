        "To find the location of the record with primeKey 'n', you would need to parse the file, read each line until you find the line starting with 'n', and then return the value in the 'location' column of that line. \n\nThe steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Open the file in a read mode.\n\n2. Read each line of the file. The file appears to be a tab-separated value file, so you would split each line by tabs.\n\n3. For each line, check if the first value (after splitting by tabs) matches 'n'. \n\n4. If a match is found, split the line by tabs and return the value that corresponds to the 'location' column (in this case, the last value). \n\n5. If no match is found after reading all lines, return an error or a message indicating that no record was found with primeKey 'n'.\n\nNote: This process assumes that 'primeKey' values are unique. If they are not, this process would return the location for the first match found. Also, it assumes that each line of the file consistently follows the format of having the 'location' as the last value. If the format is not consistent, additional error checking and handling would be needed.\n\nFollowing these steps, you would find that the location for primeKey 'n' is 'GA'. This is based on this line from the file:\n\n`n\temployed\t864752\tNVIDIA\tGA`\n\nSo, 'GA' is the correct answer to give. \n\nRemember, you'll need to handle potential errors, such as if the file cannot be opened, or if no record with primeKey 'n' is found. You might also need to consider efficiency if the file is very large, in which case reading line by line (also known as streaming) would be a good approach."
