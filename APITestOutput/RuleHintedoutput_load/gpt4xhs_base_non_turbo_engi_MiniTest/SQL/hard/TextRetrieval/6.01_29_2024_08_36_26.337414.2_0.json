        "To get the answer from the file, follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Reading the File**: First, open and read the file. You can use built-in methods in languages like Python or Java to read the content of the file.\n\n2. **Parsing the File**: Next, parse the content of the file. The file seems to be tab-separated, meaning each value is separated by a tab. Split the content of each line by tabs to get individual values. \n\n3. **Storing Data in Memory**: Store these values in a suitable data structure. For a simple format like this, a dictionary or hash map would be suitable where the primeKey is the key and the value is another dictionary containing all other information pertaining to that primeKey.\n\n4. **Iterating over Data**: Once you have stored the data in memory, iterate over the data structure to find the record with primeKey 'c'.\n\n5. **Getting Required Information**: Finally, extract the age for the record with primeKey 'c' from your data structure.\n\nHere is a simple Python code snippet to achieve above steps:\n\n```python\ndef get_data(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        lines = file.readlines()\n    data = {}\n    headers = lines[0].split('\\t')\n    for line in lines[1:]:\n        values = line.split('\\t')\n        primeKey = values[0]\n        data[primeKey] = {header: value for header, value in zip(headers, values)}\n    return data\n\ndef get_age(primeKey, data):\n    return data[primeKey]['age']\n\ndata = get_data('path_to_your_file')\nprint(get_age('c', data))\n```\n\nThis code will print '62', which is the age of record with primeKey 'c'. Be aware that this is a simple example and real-world files can be much more complex requiring careful handling of potential obstacles listed above."
