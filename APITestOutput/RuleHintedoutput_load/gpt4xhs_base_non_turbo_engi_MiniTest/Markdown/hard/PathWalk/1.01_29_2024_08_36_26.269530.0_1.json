certain challenges may arise when attempting to extract information and provide answers from a file containing a QA format or special syntax:\n\n1. **Complex Structure**: The file might have a deeply nested structure or non-linear organization, which can make it difficult to locate specific information.\n\n2. **Ambiguity**: Questions in the file might be ambiguous, lack context, or reference external information that is not included in the file itself.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: The Markdown file could have inconsistent formatting or use non-standard Markdown extensions, making it difficult to parse reliably.\n\n4. **Embedded Content**: There may be links, images, or other embedded content within the file which are essential to understanding the context or content of the QA, and such items might not be easily interpreted without additional processing.\n\n5. **Variability in Headers**: Questions and answers might be under different header levels, which requires the parser to understand the hierarchy of headers to correctly associate questions with their corresponding answers.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: If the file contains code blocks or inline code snippets, these must be appropriately distinguished from regular text to avoid misinterpretation.\n\n7. **Tables and Lists**: The presence of tables or lists could introduce complexity in parsing as they have a different structure than plain text.\n\n8. **Metadata**: The file may contain metadata (like YAML front matter) that isn't part of the main content but might be relevant to understanding the context of the QA.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing strategy would need to be implemented, which would likely include:\n\n- A syntax tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) generator to maintain document structure.\n- Pattern recognition to identify QA pairs within the document.\n- Context handling to manage ambiguities and references.\n- Handlers for various Markdown elements like headings, lists, links, images, code blocks, etc.\n- Error correction and recovery mechanisms for dealing with unexpected or malformed input.\n- A method for mapping structure and hierarchy (e.g.,

        "To answer the question \"What is the content of 2th subsubsection under 1th subsection under 2th section?\", we would need to parse the markdown file and find the relevant section. \n\nThe markdown headers are represented with '#' symbols.
