        "The question asks to extract all bold texts from the given file. Bold texts in markdown format are usually represented by using either double asterisks ** or double underscores __ before and after the text. \n\nHere are the steps to extract the bold texts:\n\n1. Read the file: Read the content of the file.\n\n2. Identify the bold texts: Look for patterns that denote bold text, such as text surrounded by double asterisks or double underscores. A regular expression can be useful here.\n\n3. Extract the bold texts: Once the bold text patterns are identified, extract the actual text between these patterns. Again, regular expressions can be helpful.\n\n4. Print the bold texts: Print each of the extracted bold texts, separated by a newline (\\n).\n\nA Python code snippet that would do this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# read the file\nwith open('file.md') as f:\n    content = f.read()\n\n# find all bold texts\nbold_texts = re.findall(r'\\*\\*(.*?)\\*\\*', content)\n\n# print each bold text\nfor text in bold_texts:\n    print(text)\n```\n\nThis code reads the file, finds every occurrence of text surrounded by double asterisks (which represents bold text in Markdown), and then prints each occurrence on a new line. Note that this will only work for Markdown files, and it assumes that there are no nested bold tags (i.e., bold text within other bold text). If the file uses underscores for bold text instead of asterisks, or if there are nested tags, additional processing would be needed. \n\nAs mentioned in the difficulties and obstacles section, this process could be much more complex depending on the specifics of the file's format, syntax, and contents."
