        "To extract all the included image files and print their names separated by '\\n', one can use a Markdown parser (like Python's markdown module or JavaScript's marked module) with a customized renderer. \n\nThe customized renderer should override the default image rendering method to extract the image file name instead of generating an `<img>` tag. The following is an example using Python's markdown module:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\nfrom markdown.inlinepatterns import ImageInlineProcessor\n\nclass FileNameExtractor(markdown.Markdown):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self.image_filenames = []\n\n    def handleMatch(self, m, data):\n        src, title, text = self.parseLink(m, data)\n        self.image_filenames.append(src)\n        return '', m.start(0), m.end(0)\n\nmd = FileNameExtractor(extensions=['extra'])\nmd.inlinePatterns.register(ImageInlineProcessor(r'!\\[(.*?)\\]\\((.*?)\\)', md), 'image_link', 180)\nmd.convert(file_content)\n\nfor filename in md.image_filenames:\n    print(filename)\n```\nThis code overrides the `ImageInlineProcessor` of the markdown module and appends the image source (the file name in this case) to the `image_filenames` list. After parsing the markdown content, it prints each filename.\n\nNote: \n- `file_content` is the content of the file you want to parse.\n- This code will only parse inline images written as `![alt text](url)`. Other forms of images like reference-style images or HTML `<img>` tags will not be detected.\n- If your images have absolute URLs instead of just file names, you may need to extract the file name from the URL. You can do this by parsing the URL (for example, using Python's urllib.parse.urlparse function).\n- This code doesn't deal with some of the potential difficulties and obstacles mentioned before, like ambiguity of different Markdown flavors or nested structures. Depending on your specific case you may need a more complex parser."
