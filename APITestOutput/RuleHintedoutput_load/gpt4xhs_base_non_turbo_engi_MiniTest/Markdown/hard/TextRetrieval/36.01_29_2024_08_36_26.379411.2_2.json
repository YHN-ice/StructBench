Here are some of these potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Markdown Syntax Variability**: Markdown has various ways to represent similar constructs.

Text can be emphasized using \"*\", \"_\" or combinations of them.\n\n2. **Nested Structures**: Questions and answers in Markdown could be nested within bullet points, blockquotes, or other Markdown structures, which makes parsing more complex since the structure must be interpreted correctly to assign which parts are questions and which parts are answers.\n\n3. **Ambiguity in Delineating Q&A**: Without a strict format for differentiating questions from answers, it might be challenging to accurately parse which text is part of the question and which is part of the answer. For example, if there's no clear delimiter like \"Q:\" or \"A:\", it may be difficult to distinguish them programmatically.\n\n4. **Inline Formatting and Links**: Questions and answers may contain inline formatting such as bold, italic, code spans, or hyperlinks which may need to be handled or stripped out depending on the requirements.\n\n5. **Non-Textual Content**: Markdown can include images, tables, and other non-textual content which may not be relevant to the Q&A context but could complicate parsing.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Indentation and Line Breaks**: Markdown allows for flexibility in formatting which might lead to inconsistent indentation and line breaks that have to be managed when parsing the file.\n\n7. **Metadata and Front Matter**: Some Markdown files contain YAML front matter or other metadata at the beginning of a file, which needs to be distinguished from the main content.\n\n8. **References and Footnotes**: Markdown supports references and footnotes, which can appear later in the document but may refer to content within the Q&A section.\n\n9. **Encoding and Character Escapes**: Special characters in Markdown might be escaped, and these escapes need to be correctly interpreted in order to render the text accurately.\n\n10. **Contextual Information**: Sometimes, the question or answer might refer to information earlier or later in the document, or to external sources, which the parser might not have access to.\n\n11. **Language and Semantics**: Parsing text also involves understanding the semantics of the question to provide an"
