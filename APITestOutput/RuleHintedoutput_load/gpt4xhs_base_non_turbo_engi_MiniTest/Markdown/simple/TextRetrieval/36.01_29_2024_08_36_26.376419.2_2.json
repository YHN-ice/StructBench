        "To answer the question \"Extract all included image files. Print those file names separated by \\n.\" from the given file, we need to find the lines that contain image references. In Markdown syntax, images are represented with an exclamation mark followed by square brackets containing alt text, then parentheses containing the file path and optional \"hover text\".\n\nIn this case, we are solely interested in the image file names. Hence, we do not need to extract the alt text or hover text.\n\nThe answer to the question would be obtained by following these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. For each line, search for a pattern that matches the Markdown image syntax. In Python, you could use a regular expression like `!\\[.*\\]\\((.*?)\\ \".*\"\\)`.\n3. This pattern will match all image references in a line.\n4. Extract the file name (in the parentheses) from each image reference and print it, followed by a newline character (\\n).\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that implements these steps:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# File content as string\nfile_content = \"\"\"\nm\nperish idiot yogurt groot essence kangaroo monkey groot\n# n\nqualify idiot yogurt groot essence kan![alt](vg.gif \"hover text\")garoo monkey groot\n## o\nravish idiot yogurt groot essenc**kangaroo**![alt](wg.gif \"hover text\")essence kangaroo monkey groot\n\"\"\"\n\n# Regular expression pattern to match Markdown image syntax\nimage_pattern = re.compile(r'!\\[.*?\\]\\((.*?) \".*?\"\\)', re.MULTILINE)\n\n# Find all matches in the file content\nmatches = image_pattern.findall(file_content)\n\n# Print each match on a separate line\nfor match in matches:\n    print(match)\n```\n\nThis code will print:\n\n```\nvg.gif\nwg.gif\n```\n\nThe potential difficulties and latent obstacles mentioned above still apply.
