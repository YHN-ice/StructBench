Disambiguating such cases would require understanding context, which is beyond simple parsing.\n\n3. **Implicit Answers**: Sometimes, the answer to a question might not be stated explicitly in the text but rather implied through a series of statements or examples.

        "To extract all bold text from a Markdown file, we would need to create or use a parser that understands the syntax of Markdown. In Markdown, bold text is usually written by surrounding the text with double asterisks or underscores, like **bold** or __bold__. \n\nHere is a simple Python script that uses regex (regular expressions) to find all bold texts in the file:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Read the Markdown file\nwith open('file.md', 'r') as f:\n    content = f.read()\n\n# Regex pattern to find all bold texts\npattern = r'\\*\\*(.*?)\\*\\*'\n\n# Find all bold texts and print them\nbold_texts = re.findall(pattern, content)\nfor text in bold_texts:\n    print(text)\n```\n\nThis script opens the file, reads its content, and uses `re.findall()` function with the pattern `\\*\\*(.*?)\\*\\*` to find all instances of bold text in the file. The `(.*?)` part of the pattern captures the content inside the double asterisks. This will print out all the bold texts separated by new lines.\n\nNote: This script assumes that the file's content is properly formatted according to Markdown syntax and that no other special characters or escape sequences interfere with this syntax. It will not work correctly if, for example, there are unmatched or nested double asterisks in the file.\n\nIn our given example, only the word 'kangaroo' is marked as bold using double asterisks and hence it is returned as the answer."
