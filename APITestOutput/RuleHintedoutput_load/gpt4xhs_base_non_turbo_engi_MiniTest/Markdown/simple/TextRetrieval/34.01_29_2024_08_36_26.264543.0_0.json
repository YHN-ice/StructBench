        "To extract all bold texts from the given file, we can utilize regular expressions (regex). In Markdown, bold text is typically denoted by wrapping the text in two asterisks or underscores without spaces. The regular expression to match this would be \"\\\\*\\\\*(.*?)\\\\*\\\\*\" or \"__(.*?)__\". \n\nHere is a basic step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Open the file in read mode in your preferred programming language.\n2. Read the file content into a string variable.\n3. Compile your regular expression using the pattern \"\\\\*\\\\*(.*?)\\\\*\\\\*\".\n4. Use the findall() method of your regex object to find all matches in your string.\n5. The findall() method will return a list of all matches. Loop through this list and print each element, separating them by a newline character (\\n).\n\nIn Python, it would look like this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Open the file and read the content\nwith open('your_file.md', 'r') as file:\n    content = file.read()\n\n# Create regex object\nbold_regex = re.compile(r'\\*\\*(.*?)\\*\\*')\n\n# Find matches\nmatches = bold_regex.findall(content)\n\n# Print matches\nfor match in matches:\n    print(match)\n```\n\nThis code should extract and print all bold texts from your Markdown file. Please note that this solution may not cover all corner cases due to the complexities of Markdown parsing mentioned above. It is advisable to use a Markdown parsing library if you need to handle more complex cases."
