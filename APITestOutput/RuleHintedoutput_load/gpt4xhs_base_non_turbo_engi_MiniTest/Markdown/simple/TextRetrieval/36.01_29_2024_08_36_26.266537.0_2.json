It will be necessary to navigate the hierarchical structure defined by headers and subheaders or search through lists and paragraphs to find relevant information.\n\n3. **Code Blocks and Formatting**: If the Markdown file contains code blocks or special formatting, it needs to be interpreted correctly, ensuring that any code or commands are not confused with regular text.\n\n4. **Links and References**: The file may contain hyperlinks or references to external resources, which need to be handled properly.

        "To answer the given question, firstly, you need to identify what type of data you need to extract from the file. In this case, you are asked to extract all included image files and print those file names. \n\nMarkdown files use a specific syntax to include images. Typically, an image is included in a markdown file with the following structure: `![alt text](url \"title\")`. This is known as an inline image link. The URL points to the location of the image file and the title appears when you hover your mouse over the image.\n\nTo find these image file names in the given file, you would scan through the file line by line and check for this specific markdown image syntax. Once you locate this syntax, you would then extract the URL which should point to an image file. The extracted URL will be the file name of the image.\n\nIn the given example, there is one line that matches the markdown image syntax. It is `![alt](zi.jpeg \"hover text\")`. By checking this line, we can find the image file name which is 'zi.jpeg'. So, your answer in this case would be 'zi.jpeg'. \n\nOne potential difficulty in this task is to correctly identify and parse the markdown image syntax. You would need to correctly handle any variations or complexities in the markdown syntax, such as different ways to include images or special characters in the URL or alt text. You can use regular expression (regex) pattern matching to accurately find and extract the required data from the markdown file. Be sure to handle any error or exception that might occur during this process, such as missing or incorrect data."
