        "To extract all bold texts from the file, you'd need to look for the markdown syntax for bold texts. In markdown, bold texts are typically wrapped between double asterisks or double underscores. In this case, the bold text is \"kangaroo\" which is wrapped between double asterisks.\n\nTo print those raw texts separated by \\n (newline), we need to use a regular expression (regex) tool to find all instances of bold text in the file. \n\nThe regex pattern for identifying markdown bold text could be: `/\\*\\*(.*?)\\*\\*/g`\n\nWhen using this pattern, it will search the whole text (`g` flag for global) and find all substrings wrapped in double asterisks. The `(.*?)` part is a capturing group that will match any character (.) as many times as possible (`*`) but as few times as needed to still allow the rest of the pattern to match (`?`). \n\nAfter identifying and extracting all instances of bold text, we can print them out separated by \\n.\n\nPlease note that this process requires programming knowledge, particularly in a language such as Python or JavaScript which has built-in support for regular expressions. If you're not familiar with programming, you may need to use a markdown editor or converter tool that will let you view the raw text version of a markdown file."
