        "To access the value \"u\", you can follow this path in the file structure: \n\nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"] \n\nHere's the breakdown: \n\n- \"subs\" is a key in the main dictionary object. It contains a list as its value, so we access the first item in that list with [0]. \n- This item is another dictionary, which also has \"subs\" as a key. Again, this key contains a list as its value, so we access the first item in that list with another [0]. \n- This item is yet another dictionary, which has \"X\" as a key. This key's value is \"u\", which is what we're looking for. So, we finally access it with [\"X\"]. \n\nTherefore, obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"] gets us the value \"u\"."
