This combines data from both tables for each person.\n\n2. With the merged data, we then filter for people who work in IL (Illinois). This can be done by checking the \"location\" column.\n\n3. From this filtered data, we need to find people who are taller than 159. This can be done by checking the \"height\" column.\n\n4.
