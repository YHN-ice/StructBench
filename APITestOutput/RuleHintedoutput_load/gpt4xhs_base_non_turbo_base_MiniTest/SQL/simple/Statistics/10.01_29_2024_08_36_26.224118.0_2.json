        "To get the answer from the file, you would have to write a program or script to read and parse the file. You can use any programming language for this, but one common language for such tasks is Python. To get the answer, you would:\n\n1. Open the file and read its contents line by line.\n2. Split each line on the tab character to get a list of fields.\n3. Examine the field that represents the gender (in this case, the second field). If it is \"female\", increment a counter.\n4. Continue this process for each line in the file.\n5. At the end, the counter will hold the number of people who are female.\n\nHere is a rough Python script that does this:\n\n```python\ncount = 0\nwith open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n    lines = f.readlines()\n    for line in lines:\n        fields = line.split('\\t')\n        if fields[1] == 'female':\n            count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis script assumes that the filename is 'file.txt'. If the filename is different, you should change 'file.txt' to the actual filename.\n\nAlso, this script assumes that the file is structured exactly as in the example: tabs between fields and a newline at the end of each line. If the file is structured differently, you may need to adjust the script accordingly."
