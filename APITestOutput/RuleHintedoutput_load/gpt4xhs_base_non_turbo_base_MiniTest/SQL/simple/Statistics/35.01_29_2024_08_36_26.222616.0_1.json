        "To answer the question, one has to first understand the question and then extract the relevant information from the file. \nThe Question is \"How many people work with salary more than 922576?\".\n\nThe file contains two tables. The first table contains information about people such as their gender, age, name, height, weight, and color. The second table contains information about their employment status, salary, company, and location.\n\nTo find the answer to the question, we need to look at the second table which contains salary information. We are interested in the 'salary' column. \n\nFrom the 'salary' column in the second table, we can see that only one person (with primeKey 'd') earns a salary more than 922576. However, according to the question, we need to find out how many people are \"working\" with a salary greater than 922576. \n\nThe 'status' column in the second table tells us about the employment status of each person. From this column, we can see that the person with primeKey 'd' is retired and not currently working. \n\nTherefore, there are 0 people who are working with a salary more than 922576.
