        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in CA are taller than 167?\", you would need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify all the people who work in CA. In this case, they are individuals with primeKeys \"b\", \"d\", and \"l\". \n\n2. For each of these individuals, check their height in the first table. The heights are \"121\", \"196\", and \"145\" respectively.\n\n3. Count the number of these individuals who are taller than 167. In this case, only one person (primeKey \"d\") is taller than 167.\n\nSo, the answer is 1."
