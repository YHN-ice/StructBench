        "To find the age of the record with primeKey 'c', you would need to look at the file structure. This file seems to be a tab-separated value file (TSV), with two sections. \n\nThe first section has headers: primeKey, gender, age, name, height, weight, color, and the second one has headers: primeKey, status, salary, company, location. \n\nTo get the answer, you need to scan the line entries in the first section under the 'primeKey' column until you find the key 'c'. Once you find 'c', then you look at the value in the 'age' column of that same line. \n\nIn this case, the line with primeKey 'c' is: \n\nc\tmale\t62\ty\t212\t120\tolive\n\nAnd therefore, the age of the record with primeKey 'c' is 62, as stated in the answer."
