The arrow '->' can be assumed to be directed from parent node to a child node. To find the height of the root node, we would need to find the longest path from the root ('t') to any leaf nodes. The path in the file with the longest sequence from 't' is 't->u->v->w', which consists of 3 edges. So, the height of the root node is 3."
