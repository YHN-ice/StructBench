        "The height of a tree is calculated by the longest path from the root node to any leaf nodes. In this case, the root node is 'h'. The longest path from the root node 'h' to a leaf node is 3 edges. This is calculated by following the path from 'h' to 'i', 'i' to 'j', and then 'j' to any of its child nodes ('k', 'l', 'm', 'n'). This is the same for the other child nodes of 'h', such as 'db', 'yb', or 'tc'. Therefore, the height of the root node 'h' is 3."
