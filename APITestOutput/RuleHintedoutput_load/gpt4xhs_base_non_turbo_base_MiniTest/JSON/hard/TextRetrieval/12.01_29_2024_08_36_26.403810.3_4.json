        "To answer this question, we need to traverse the JSON file in a depth-first manner and look for the objects that do not contain any nested lists or dictionaries. When we encounter an object with an empty \"subs\" list, this means we have reached the most deeply nested object, so we print it out as it appears in the file. Repeat this process for all objects in the file.\n\nFirst, parse the JSON file into a Python dictionary using a function like json.load(). Then use a recursive function to traverse the dictionary. The function should take as input an object from the dictionary and check if its \"subs\" list is empty. If it is, the function prints the object. If it's not, the function recursively calls itself on each item in the \"subs\" list.\n\nAfter running this recursive traversal, the output should be:\n\n{\n\"id\":\"u\",\n\"V\":\"wy\",\n\"U\":\"vy\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}\n\n{\n\"id\":\"v\",\n\"T\":\"uy\",\n\"S\":\"ty\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}\n\n{\n\"id\":\"x\",\n\"P\":\"qy\",\n\"O\":\"py\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}\n\n{\n\"id\":\"y\",\n\"N\":\"oy\",\n\"M\":\"ny\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}\n\n{\n\"id\":\"bb\",\n\"J\":\"ky\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}\n\n{\n\"id\":\"cb\",\n\"I\":\"jy\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}\n\n{\n\"id\":\"eb\",\n\"G\":\"hy\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}\n\n{\n\"id\":\"fb\",\n\"F\":\"gy\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}"
