        "To get the answer from the file, you need to parse the JSON file and look for the object with the id 'cb'. \n\nFirst, you would start at the root of the JSON file. The 'id' in this case is 'q', so you know the object you're looking for isn't at this level. You would then look at the 'subs' array, which contains objects nested within the root object.\n\nYou would iterate over each object in the 'subs' array, again checking the 'id'. None of the objects at this level have the 'id' 'cb' either, so you would need to delve deeper and check the 'subs' array within each of these objects.\n\nFinally, when iterating over the 'subs' array of the object with 'id' 'y', you would find the object with 'id' 'cb'. This whole object is:\n{\n \"id\":\"cb\",\n \"I\":\"ny\",\n \"H\":\"my\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n   \"id\":\"db\",\n   \"G\":\"ly\",\n   \"F\":\"ky\",\n   \"subs\":[]\n  },\n  {\n   \"id\":\"eb\",\n   \"E\":\"jy\",\n   \"D\":\"iy\",\n   \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n}\n\nThis is your answer."
