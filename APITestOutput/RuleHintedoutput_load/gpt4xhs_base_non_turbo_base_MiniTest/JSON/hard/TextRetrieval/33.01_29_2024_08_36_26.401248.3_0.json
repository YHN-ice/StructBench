        "To answer the question, you would need to parse the JSON file and search for the object with the \"id\" property equal to \"u\". Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Parse the JSON file to convert it into a programmable object or structure.\n2. Traverse the object or structure from the root, checking each node's \"id\" property.\n3. When you find a node whose \"id\" is equal to \"u\", return that entire object as your answer.\n\nIn this case, the searched object with id \"u\" is located under the subs array of the object with id \"t\", which in turn is in the subs array of the object with id \"s\". The object with id \"s\" is in the subs array of the root object with id \"r\". Here is the exact answer:\n\n{\n\"id\":\"u\",\n\"V\":\"wy\",\n\"U\":\"vy\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}"
