        "To answer the question, you need to parse the JSON file and search for the object with the id \"z\". \n\n1. Parse the JSON file into a python dictionary using the `json` library's `json.loads()` function. \n\n2. Write a recursive function to traverse through the dictionary. If the dictionary has a key \"id\" and its value is \"z\", return that dictionary. \n\n3. If the dictionary has a key \"subs\", call the recursive function on each of its elements. \n\n4. If none of the above return a dictionary, return None. \n\nHere is how you can implement this in python:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_id(data, id_to_find):\n    if \"id\" in data and data[\"id\"] == id_to_find:\n        return data\n    if \"subs\" in data:\n        for sub in data[\"subs\"]:\n            result = find_id(sub, id_to_find)\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n    return None\n\ndata = json.loads(file_content)  # file_content is a string containing the content of your file\nresult = find_id(data, \"z\")\n```\n\nThe `result` variable will now contain the object with id \"z\". If no such object exist, `result` will be `None`."
