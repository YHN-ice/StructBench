You can use a programming language to read the file line by line, and for each line, use a regular expression to match and extract text that is enclosed in double square brackets. \n\nIn Python, this can be done with the following steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries:\n   ```python\n   import re\n   ```\n\n2. Open the file and read it line by line:\n   ```python\n   with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n       lines = f.readlines()\n   ```\n\n3. For each line, find matches with the regular expression and print them:\n   ```python\n   for line in lines:\n       match = re.findall('\\[\\[(.*?)\\]\\]', line)\n       if match:\n           print('\\n'.join(match))\n   ```\n\nThis will print all image file names separated by a newline character (\\n)."
