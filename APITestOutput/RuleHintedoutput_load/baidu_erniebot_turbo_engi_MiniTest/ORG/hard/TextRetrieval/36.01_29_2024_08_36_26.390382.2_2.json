        "To extract all included image files from a file with a special format and syntax, such as an ORG file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Syntax**: First, you need to understand the syntax of the ORG file. This includes understanding the structure of headings, lists, links, and other elements.\n2. **Identify Image Blocks**: Once you have a basic understanding of the syntax, you can start identifying image blocks in the file. These blocks should contain information about the image files themselves, such as their names and formats.\n3. **Separate File Names**: You can use a regular expression to separate the file names from the rest of the text in the image blocks. This will allow you to extract all the file names and save them in a separate list or file.\n\nHere's an example regular expression that might work for your file:\n\n\n```regex\n(?i)(?<=\\[\\[.*?\\]\\])\\w+\\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif)\n```\nThis regex will match any file name that follows the format `[[filename.extension]]`. It will also ignore any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: It's important to handle any errors that may occur during the parsing process. For example, if there are any missing or invalid image blocks in the file, your parser should be able to detect this and provide an appropriate error message.\n\nRemember that a robust parser for an ORG file will need to handle a variety of complexities, including nested sections, metadata interpretation, special blocks, dynamic content, embedded content, cross-references, and more. Therefore, it's recommended that you use a well-tested and reliable parser library for this task."
