The provided file appears to be an Org-mode file, which typically has a nested outline structure. Look for special tags or properties that might indicate the locations of image files.\n2. **Identify potential difficulties and obstacles:** Review the list of potential difficulties and obstacles provided by the ORG parser, and note any specific issues that might apply to your file.\n3. **Use appropriate tools and libraries:** Depending on the complexity of the file, you may need to use a specialized ORG parser library or tool to extract the desired information accurately.

These might be stored in metadata properties or within the outline structure.\n5. **Extract and separate image file names:** Once you have identified the locations of image files, you can extract their names and separate them using a suitable delimiter, such as a newline character (\\n).\n6. **Validate and test your solution:** Validate your solution by testing it with a representative sample of the file content to ensure that it extracts the desired information accurately.\n\nPlease note that parsing complex ORG files can be challenging, especially if they contain variations in syntax or special blocks that require interpretation.
