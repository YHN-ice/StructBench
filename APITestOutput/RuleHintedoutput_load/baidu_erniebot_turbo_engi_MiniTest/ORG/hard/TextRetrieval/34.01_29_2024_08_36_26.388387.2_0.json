Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to get information from an ORG file:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Structure**: ORG files are organized hierarchically with headlines, subheadings, and content under each. Understanding the levels and their relationships is key to extracting information correctly.\n\n2. **Special Syntax**: Org-mode uses a special syntax for various elements like TODO items, tags, properties, links, and timestamps. Interpreting these correctly is crucial.\n\n3. **Dynamic Content**: Some ORG files contain dynamic blocks or embedded code that can be executed to update or generate content. Static parsing may not capture this dynamic information.\n\n4. **Tables**: ORG files can contain complex tables that may use formulas. Extracting and interpreting data from them might be challenging.\n\n5. **Markup**: Org-mode supports rich text formatting with bold, italic, underline, etc., which is represented with specific markup. Deciphering the actual content from the markup is essential.\n\n6. **Embedded Elements**: An ORG file can contain links, footnotes, and other embedded elements whose details might need to be resolved or followed for a complete answer.\n\n7. **File Links**: If the ORG file contains links to other files or external resources, it might be necessary to access those resources to answer the question fully.\n\n8. **Version Differences**: Org-mode has evolved over time, and newer or older features might not be supported by all parsers.\n\n9. **Multilingual Content**: If the ORG file contains content in multiple languages or uses non-standard alphabets, this may introduce complications.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser must be designed to understand and interpret the ORG file's syntax and structure accurately. It may also need to execute embedded code or access linked files if required by the question context."

        "To extract all bold texts from an ORG file, you can use a parser that understands the syntax and structure of the file. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Identify the Parser**: There are various tools available to parse ORG files, such as org-babel-parse, org-mode-extract, and org-ruby-parser. You can identify the best parser based on its capabilities and compatibility with your specific requirements.\n2. **Configure the Parser**: Follow the instructions provided by the parser's documentation to configure it with the correct options and settings. This may include specifying the path to the ORG file or providing additional contextual information.\n3. **Extract Bold Texts**: Use the parser to parse the ORG file and identify bold texts within it. Depending on the parser, you may need to implement custom logic to extract bold text using appropriate criteria.\n4. **Interpret and Format Results**: After extracting bold texts, you may need to interpret and format them according to the question's requirements. For example, you may need to separate the raw texts using \\n and print them out.\n5. **Validate and Test**: Once you have extracted bold texts from the ORG file, validate and test the results to ensure they meet the question's expectations.\n\nIn terms of potential difficulties and obstacles, it's important to note that parsing an ORG file involves understanding its syntax and structure, which can be challenging due to its hierarchical organization and special syntax elements. However, with the right parser and appropriate processing logic, you should be able to extract bold texts from an ORG file accurately.\n\nRemember that selecting a suitable parser and implementing appropriate processing logic is crucial for successfully extracting bold texts from an ORG file. Additionally, it's advisable to test your solution with various ORG files to ensure its robustness and reliability."
