        "To extract all bold texts from the given ORG file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Parse the ORG file**: First, you need to parse the ORG file to extract the bold texts. An ORG file parser can help you with this task. It should be able to extract the bold text blocks from the file and provide them as raw text.\n2. **Identify bold text blocks**: An ORG file parser should be able to identify bold text blocks based on the syntax and format of the file. These blocks should be separated by special characters or delimiters, such as * or **.\n3. **Extract raw text**: After identifying the bold text blocks, you can extract the raw text from each block and separate them using \\n.\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python that demonstrates how you can parse an ORG file and extract bold text:\n\n\n```python\nimport orgfile\n\n# Load the ORG file\norg_file = orgfile.OrgFile(\"path/to/your/file.org\")\n\n# Iterate over bold text blocks\nfor block in org_file.blocks:\n    if block.is_bold:  # Check if the block is bold\n        bold_text = block.text\n        # Separate the raw text using \\n\n        raw_text = bold_text.split(\"\\n\")\n        # Print the raw text\n        print(raw_text)\n```\nThis code snippet assumes that you have already installed an ORG file parser library in your Python environment, such as `orgfile` or `org-file`. If you don't have one, you can use a third-party library or write your own parser to parse the ORG file and extract bold text blocks.\n\nRemember that parsing an ORG file can be challenging due to its complex structure and syntax, so it's important to have a thorough understanding of the file format and conventions to correctly extract bold text. If you encounter any difficulties, refer to the documentation of the ORG file parser library or seek help from the community for more assistance."
