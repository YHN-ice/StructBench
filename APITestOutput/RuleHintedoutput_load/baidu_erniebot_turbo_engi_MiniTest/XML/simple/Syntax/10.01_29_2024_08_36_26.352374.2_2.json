This could require streaming or chunking the file to handle it effectively.\n\n3. **Namespace Handling:** XML namespaces are used to avoid naming conflicts by qualifying element and attribute names. Properly handling namespaces is crucial for correctly interpreting the elements in an XML document.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues:** XML files can use different character encodings. If the encoding is not correctly identified and handled, it could lead to incorrect parsing of content.\n\n5. **Schema Validation:** If the XML file is based on a specific schema (like XSD), ensuring that the file adheres to that schema is necessary for accurate interpretation.
