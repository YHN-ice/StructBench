        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Data Structure**: First, you need to identify the structure of the data in the file. Based on the provided table structure, you can see that it is a two-column table with headers and rows of data.\n2. **Parse the Data**: You can use a programming language or a dedicated data parsing tool to parse the file and extract the information you are interested in. For example, in Python, you can use the pandas library to read and parse CSV files.\n3. **Find the Query**: Based on the question you have provided, you want to know how many people have a salary greater than 358275. You can locate this information by searching for rows where the salary column has a value greater than 358275.\n4. **Count the Results**: Once you have found all the rows that meet your criteria, you can count the number of rows to get the answer.\n\nHere's an example in Python using pandas:\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the file as a dataframe\ndf = pd.read_csv('file_path')\n\n# Find rows with salary greater than 358275\nrows_with_high_salary = df[df['salary'] > 358275]\n\n# Count the number of rows in this subset\ncount = rows_with_high_salary.shape[0]\n\nprint(f\"The number of people with salary greater than 358275 is: {count}\")\n```\nNote that this assumes your file is in CSV format and can be read by pandas. If your file has a different format or structure, you may need to use a different tool or approach.\n\nAlso, if your file is very large and loading it into memory is not feasible, you can use a streaming approach to parse the file line by line and process each line as it is read. This will allow you to process the file incrementally without loading it all into memory at once."
