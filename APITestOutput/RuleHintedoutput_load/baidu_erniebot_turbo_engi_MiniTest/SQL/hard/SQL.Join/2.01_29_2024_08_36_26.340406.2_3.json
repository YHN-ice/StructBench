        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line or in chunks to avoid memory issues.\n2. Parse the file based on its special format and syntax. You can use a programming language like Python or SQL to parse the file.\n3. Identify the specific data you are interested in and filter the data based on that.\n4. For questions that involve multiple conditions, you can use OR or AND logic to search for multiple rows at once.\n5. Handle any errors or missing data gracefully to avoid incorrect answers.\n6. If the file is large, consider using a more efficient method like a database or a search engine to search for the data.\n7. Ensure that the data is securely handled and complies with privacy regulations if necessary.\n\nIn this specific case, the question is asking how many people who work in IL are taller than 175. You can parse the file and filter based on the location (company column) and height (height column). If you find any rows where the company is \"IL\" and the height is greater than or equal to 175, you can count those rows as the answer.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open('file_path', 'r') as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\ncount = 0\nfor line in lines:\n    if 'IL' in line and int(line.split()[3]) >= 175:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\nThis code will read the file line by line, check if the company is \"IL\" and if the height is greater than or equal to 175, and increment the count variable by 1.
