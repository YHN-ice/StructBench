        "To get the answer from the file with special format and syntax, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Data Structure**: First, you need to understand the structure of the file. In this case, you have two tables, one with personal information and another with employment status and salary.\n2. **Parse the File**: Depending on the file format and syntax, you can use a parser or scripting language to extract the information you need. In this case, you can use a text editor or programming language like Python to parse the file.\n3. **Filter the Data**: After parsing the file, you can filter the data based on the question you have asked. In this case, you are asking about people with salary more than 922576.\n4. **Process Missing Data**: If any data is missing or incomplete, you may need to infer or look up the missing information to provide a complete answer.\n5. **Validate and Sanitize Data**: If the data is inconsistent or contains errors, it may be necessary to validate and sanitize it before processing it further.\n6. **Associate Rows with the Same PrimeKey**: Ensure that all related rows are correctly identified and associated with each other based on the primeKey.\n7. **Use Appropriate Tools and Software**: Depending on the file format and structure, you can use specialized tools or software for parsing large volumes of data efficiently.\n8. **Follow Security and Privacy Guidelines**: If necessary, follow security and privacy guidelines to handle the data appropriately.\n\nIn this case, you can use Python as a programming language to parse the file and extract the information you need. You can use libraries like pandas for parsing CSV files and handle missing values, NaN, or empty cells appropriately. Additionally, you can use SQL queries or other tools to filter and process the data based on your question.\n\nRemember that parsing specialized files with complex formats and syntax requires careful planning and preparation to ensure accurate and efficient results."
