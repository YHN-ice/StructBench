        "To extract bold texts from a Markdown file and print them separated by \\n, you can use a Markdown parser library like `commonmark-java` or `flexmark-java`. These libraries provide a convenient API for parsing Markdown text and extracting bold text.\n\nHere's an example using `flexmark-java`:\n\n1. Install the library using `maven` or `gradle`.\n\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.vladsch.flexmark</groupId>\n    <artifactId>flexmark-java</artifactId>\n    <version>latest.version</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n2. Parse the Markdown file using the library:\n\n\n```java\nimport com.vladsch.flexmark.html.HtmlRenderer;\nimport com.vladsch.flexmark.parser.Parser;\nimport com.vladsch.flexmark.util.ast.Document;\nimport com.vladsch.flexmark.util.data.MutableDataSet;\n\npublic class MarkdownParser {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        MutableDataSet options = new MutableDataSet();\n        options.set(Parser.BOLD_INDICATOR, \"^(?=\\\\S).{5,}$\"); // regular expression to match bold text pattern\n        Parser parser = Parser.builder(options).build();\n        HtmlRenderer renderer = HtmlRenderer.builder().build();\n        Document document = parser.parse(inputFile); // replace inputFile with your file path\n        StringBuilder boldTexts = new StringBuilder();\n        for (Node node : document.getChildren()) {\n            if (node instanceof Bold) { // Bold represents bold text in the AST\n                boldTexts.append(((Bold) node).getTokens().get(0).getContent().getContent()).append(\"\\n\");\n            }\n        }\n        System.out.println(boldTexts);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we use a regular expression to define the bold text pattern and parse the Markdown file using `flexmark-java`'s parser API. The AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) is traversed to extract bold text nodes and concatenate them into a string separated by \\n.\n\nMake sure to replace `inputFile` with the actual file path where your Markdown file is located. The code assumes that the file is plain text and not binary or compressed, so it can be parsed using a text-based parser library like `flexmark-java`. If you have a special format or syntax that requires a different parser library, please provide more details so that I can assist you accordingly."
