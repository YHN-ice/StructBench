        "To extract all included image files from a Markdown file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can use a Markdown parser library like `commonmark-java` or `marked` to parse the Markdown file and extract the image file names.

You can use Maven or Gradle to add it as a dependency.\n\nMaven:\n\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.commonmark</groupId>\n    <artifactId>commonmark-java</artifactId>\n    <version>0.8.4</version> <!-- or latest version -->\n</dependency>\n```\nGradle:\n\n\n```groovy\nimplementation 'org.commonmark:commonmark-java:0.8.4' // or latest version\n```\n2.
