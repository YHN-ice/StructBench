The parser must handle recursion or some form of stack management to process these correctly.\n\n4. **Inline versus Block Elements**: The distinction between inline formatting (like `*italic*` or `**bold**`) and block-level formatting (like headers or lists) has to be made to ensure the appropriate scope of the answer.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Escaping**: Code blocks are meant to be taken literally and not parsed as Markdown, which means any special characters within them shouldn't be interpreted as Markdown.

The parser must correlate these references correctly.\n\n7. **Metadata**: Some Markdown files include metadata (like YAML front matter) at the beginning of the document. The parser needs to recognize and potentially parse this as well.\n\n8. **HTML Content**: Markdown can include raw HTML for more complex formatting that isn't supported natively. The parser may need to be aware of this to provide correct information.\n\nTo address these potential difficulties, the parser must implement a robust Markdown syntax tree or another form of structured interpretation that can handle the variety of formatting and content types found in Markdown files.
