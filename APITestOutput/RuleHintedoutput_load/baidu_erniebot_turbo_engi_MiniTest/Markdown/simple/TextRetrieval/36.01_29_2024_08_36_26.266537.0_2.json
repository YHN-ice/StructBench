        "To extract the answer from the special format and syntax file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Parse the Markdown file**: You can use a library like `markdownit` to parse the Markdown file into an intermediate representation. This library is capable of handling various Markdown syntax elements, including headers, bullet points, numbered lists, blockquotes, and code blocks.\n2. **Identify questions and answers**: Once the Markdown file is parsed, you can identify the questions and answers based on their structure or markers. For example, you can use a consistent structure or markers to indicate where questions end and answers begin.\n3. **Extract file names**: Once you have identified the questions and answers, you can extract the file names from the answers. You can use regular expressions or a specific parsing strategy to identify file names and separate them from the rest of the text.\n4. **Handle special characters and media**: If the file names include special characters or embedded media, you can handle them appropriately. For example, you can replace special characters with their corresponding HTML entities or extract the media files separately.\n5. **Process external references and links**: If the answers include external references or links, you can either fetch the external content or ignore it based on the context.\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python using `markdownit` to parse the Markdown file and extract file names:\n\n\n```python\nfrom markdownit import MarkdownIt\n\nmd = MarkdownIt()\n\n# Parse Markdown file\nmarkdown_content = md.render(open('file_path').read())\n\n# Extract file names from answers\nfile_names = []\nfor answer in markdown_content['answer']:\n    if 'image' in answer:  # handle media or links here if necessary\n        file_names.extend(answer['image'])\n    # separate file names using \\n as specified in the question\n    file_names = '\\n'.join(file_names)\n\nprint(file_names)\n```\nMake sure to replace `'file_path'` with the actual path of the Markdown file you want to parse. This code snippet should extract all included image file names and print them separated by \\n.\n\nRemember to handle any potential errors or edge cases that may arise during parsing and extraction of answers. Depending on the specific requirements and structure of the Markdown file, you may need to modify or extend this code snippet accordingly."
