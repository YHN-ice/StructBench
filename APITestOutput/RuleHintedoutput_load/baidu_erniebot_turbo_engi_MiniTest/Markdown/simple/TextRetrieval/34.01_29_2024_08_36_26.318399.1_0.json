        "To extract all bold texts from the Markdown file and print those raw texts separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Use a library like `markdown` to parse the Markdown file into an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation.\n3. From the AST, locate all nodes representing bold text and extract their raw content.\n4. Separate each bold text into its own line using \\n and print it out.\n\nHere's a Python code example for achieving this:\n\n\n```python\nimport markdown\n\n# Load the Markdown file into a string\nmarkdown_file = \"\"\"...your Markdown file content...\"\"\"\n\n# Parse the Markdown file using markdown library\nmd = markdown.Markdown()\nparsed = md.convert(markdown_file)\n\n# Extract bold texts from the parsed content\nbold_texts = []\nfor node in parsed:\n    if isinstance(node, markdown.inlinepatterns.MarkdownPattern):\n        for child in node:\n            if isinstance(child, markdown.blocks.HeaderBlock):\n                if isinstance(child.get(\"text\", \"\"), list):\n                    for b in child[\"text\"]:\n                        bold_texts.append(b)\n            elif isinstance(child, markdown.blocks.ListBlock):\n                bold_texts += [x[\"children\"][0][\"children\"][0][\"children\"][1].strip()]  # skip bullets and prefix spaces\n\n# Print out each bold text on a new line using \\n\nfor b in bold_texts:\n    print(b)\n```\nMake sure to replace the `markdown_file` variable with your actual Markdown file content. The code assumes that bold text is represented by headers with bold text inside and also bold text in a bulleted list without any bullet character (`.`) before it. You might need to adjust this approach based on your specific Markdown syntax and structure.\n\nNote that this approach only extracts the bold text and separates it on \\n. It doesn't provide any further context or structure for the extracted bold texts. If you need to provide additional information or context for the extracted bold texts, you may need to add more logic to the code based on your specific requirements."
