        "To extract all bold texts from the given Markdown file, you can use a robust Markdown parser like Python's `markdown` library or Pandoc. These libraries are capable of correctly parsing and extracting bold text from a wide variety of Markdown syntax and structures.\n\nHere's an example code snippet in Python using the `markdown` library:\n\n\n```python\nimport markdown\n\nwith open(\"your_file.md\", \"r\") as f:\n    text = f.read()\n\n# Convert the Markdown text to an HTML string\nhtml = markdown.markdown(text)\n\n# Extract all bold text from the HTML string\nbold_text = [line for line in html.splitlines() if line.startswith(\"<b>\") and line.endswith(\"</b>\")]\n\n# Print the raw texts separated by \\n\nfor text in bold_text:\n    print(text)\n```\nThis code snippet reads the Markdown file, converts it to an HTML string using the `markdown` library, and then extracts all bold text from the HTML using a simple regular expression. The bold text is then printed out separated by newlines (\\n).\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the Markdown syntax is correctly formatted and follows a consistent pattern. If the Markdown is not correctly closed or if there are syntax errors, it may still work, but it could result in unexpected behavior or missed bold text.\n\nIn addition, it is worth noting that this approach assumes that all bold text is formatted using `<b>` tags, which may not always be the case. Depending on the Markdown syntax used, other tags or styles may be used to format bold text. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully review the Markdown syntax and structure before attempting to extract bold text using a parser."
