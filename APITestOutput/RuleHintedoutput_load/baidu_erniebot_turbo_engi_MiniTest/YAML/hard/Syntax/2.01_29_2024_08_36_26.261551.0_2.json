This can lead to unexpected types if the content of the file is ambiguous.\n\n6. **Multiline Strings**: YAML supports several ways to define multiline strings, and interpreting them correctly is necessary to preserve the intended formatting and content.\n\n7. **Custom Tags**: Custom tags might be used to indicate special processing instructions, which could be difficult to understand without additional context.\n\n8. **External References**: The file might reference external files or include sections from them, which would require accessing those files to get the full picture.\n\n9. **Comments**: YAML allows comments, which are not part of the actual data structure.
