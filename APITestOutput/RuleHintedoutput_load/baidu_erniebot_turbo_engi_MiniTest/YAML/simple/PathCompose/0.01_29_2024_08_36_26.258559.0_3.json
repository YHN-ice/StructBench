Understanding the structure and correctly navigating through it is crucial to retrieve the correct information.\n\n3. **Type Casting**: YAML supports various data types. When retrieving values, it's important to ensure that they are cast to the appropriate type (string, integer, boolean, etc.) for accurate interpretation.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: The question asked may be ambiguous in relation to the data provided in the YAML file.

Efficiently accessing the relevant parts of the file without loading it entirely into memory may be necessary.\n\n6. **YAML Version**: There are different versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1, 1.2).
