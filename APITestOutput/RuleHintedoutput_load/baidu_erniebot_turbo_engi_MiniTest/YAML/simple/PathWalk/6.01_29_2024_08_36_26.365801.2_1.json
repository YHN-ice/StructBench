        "To extract information from a YAML file, you can use a YAML parser such as PyYAML, ruamel.yaml, or yaml-py. These libraries allow you to parse YAML files and access their content.\n\nHere's an example using PyYAML:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n\n# Now you can access the information in data\nfirst_object_id = data['subs'][0]['id']\nprint(first_object_id)  # Output: g\n```\nIn this example, we open the file in read mode and use PyYAML's `safe_load()` function to parse the file into a Python dictionary. Then, we can access the information in the dictionary using Python's dictionary syntax.\n\nIf you're dealing with a large YAML file, you may want to consider using a recursive descent parser or a streaming parser, which can handle large files more efficiently.\n\nRemember to handle potential errors and exceptions that may occur during parsing, such as file access errors or parsing errors.\n\nAlso, it's always a good practice to validate your YAML files using a tool like SnakeYAML or PyYAML's `safe_load()` function, before parsing them to ensure that they are valid YAML files."
