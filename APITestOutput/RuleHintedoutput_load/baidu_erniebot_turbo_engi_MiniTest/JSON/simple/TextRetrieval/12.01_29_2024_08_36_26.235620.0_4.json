These challenges include:\n\n1. **JSON File Structure**: If the JSON file is complex or deeply nested, it might be difficult to navigate through the different layers of objects and arrays to find the required information.\n\n2. **Key-Value Pairs**: JSON files are based on key-value pairs. If keys are not known or are ambiguous, it might be challenging to extract the right pieces of data.\n\n3. **Data Types**: Ensuring correct interpretation of data types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, and arrays) is crucial. If the data type is not as expected, it could cause errors or misinterpretations.\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to process efficiently, potentially requiring specialized tools or methods to handle the data without running into performance issues.\n\n5. **Encoding and Character Sets**: Properly handling character encoding is vital.

Any discrepancies or errors in the data can lead to incorrect answers or an inability to answer questions at all.\n\n8. **Query Complexity**: The complexity of the question being asked might require advanced querying or filtering that could involve conditional statements, loops, or functions to extract the correct answer.\n\n9. **Updates and Changes**: If the structure of the JSON file changes over time but the parser's logic does not adapt to these changes, it can result in incorrect answers or failures to retrieve information.\n\n10. **Access Permissions**: There may be restrictions on accessing the file if it's stored remotely or if there are permissions set on the file system.\n\n11. **File Size and Memory Limitations**: When working with particularly large files, memory limitations might be encountered, which would require streaming the file in parts or using a more efficient parsing strategy.\n\n12. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The parser needs to work across different operating systems and environments which may interpret files differently.\n\n13. **Dependencies and Libraries**: Reliance on external libraries for parsing could lead to issues if those libraries"
