        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the JSON file**: Use a JSON parser library to load the JSON file into a data structure, such as a dictionary or list.\n2. **Identify the object and its properties**: The JSON file contains an array of objects, each with a unique id and possibly nested sub-objects.\n3. **Traverse the object hierarchy**: Use a recursive function or loop to traverse the object hierarchy and extract the desired information.\n4. **Handle complex structures**: If the JSON file has a deeply nested or complex structure, you may need to use a recursive function or loop to traverse multiple layers of objects and arrays.\n5. **Validate and handle missing or corrupt data**: Check for missing or corrupt data in the JSON file before attempting to parse it.\n6. **Use schema validation**: If you're parsing large or frequently updated JSON files, consider using a schema validation library to ensure that the file follows a consistent structure.\n7. **Error handling**: Add error handling logic to your parser to handle any parsing errors or missing data.\n8. **Update your parser**: If the schema of the JSON file changes, it's recommended to update your parser to handle these changes dynamically.\n\nOnce you have parsed the JSON file and extracted the desired information, you can use that information to answer the question. In this case, the question asks for the first object's id of subs, which is \"h\".\n\nRemember that it's always a good practice to validate and test your parser before using it in a production environment, especially if dealing with large or frequently updated JSON files."
