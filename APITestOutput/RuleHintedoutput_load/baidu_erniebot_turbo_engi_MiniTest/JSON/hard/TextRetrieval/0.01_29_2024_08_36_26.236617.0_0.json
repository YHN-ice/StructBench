Navigating through this structure to locate the necessary data can be challenging.\n\n2. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is particularly large, it may be difficult to process efficiently. Memory limitations and performance considerations will need to be taken into account.\n\n3. **Ambiguity in Questions**: The questions might be vague or ambiguous, making it difficult to determine what specific information is being asked for from the JSON file.\n\n4. **Variability in Structure**: If the JSON structure isn't consistent or is poorly documented, it can be hard to predict where in the JSON hierarchy the required information is stored.\n\n5. **Encoding and Characters**: Special characters or encoding within the JSON file may not be handled correctly, leading to errors in parsing or incorrect data retrieval.\n\n6. **Date and Number Formats**: JSON doesn't have a date type, so dates are usually stored as strings. This can lead to confusion when interpreting dates, especially when considering different locales and time zones. Similarly, number formatting might differ (comma as decimal separator, etc.), which could lead to misinterpretation.\n\n7. **Updates in Data Format**: If the format of the JSON file changes over time but the parser isn't updated accordingly, it may fail to find the correct data or misinterpret the new structure.\n\n8. **Errors in JSON Format**: Improperly formatted JSON (missing commas, extra braces, incorrect quotes) will cause parsing to fail unless the parser is equipped to handle such errors gracefully.\n\n9. **Security Issues**: Malformed or malicious JSON might pose a security risk if the parser doesn't properly validate and sanitize the input.\n\n10. **Data Type Mismatches**: Since JSON supports various data types (string, number, object, array, boolean, null), mismatches between expected and actual types can lead to errors.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it's important to have robust parsing logic that can handle complexity, validate input, manage memory efficiently, and correctly interpret the structure and data contained within the JSON file."
