Efficient parsing algorithms would be necessary to handle large amounts of data without excessive memory use or slow processing times.\n\n5. **Error Handling:** The file might contain errors, inconsistencies, or missing data that need to be identified and handled gracefully to avoid incorrect parsing results.\n\n6. **Ambiguity:** There may be ambiguous elements within the file that are open to interpretation.
