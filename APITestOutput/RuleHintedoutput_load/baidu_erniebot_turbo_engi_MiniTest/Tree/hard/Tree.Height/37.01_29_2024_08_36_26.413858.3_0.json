        "Based on the provided file format and syntax, it seems like the file contains a directed graph represented as a string of nodes and edges. The nodes are represented by their names, and the edges are represented by the names of the nodes they connect.\n\nTo extract the height of the root node (i.e., the number of edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf node) from this file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Parse the file**: First, you need to parse the file to extract the nodes and edges. This can be done by using a regular expression or a parser library such as Python's `re` module or `PLY` library for parsing `.ply` files.\n2. **Identify the root node**: Once you have parsed the file, you need to identify the root node. The root node is usually the node with no incoming edges (i.e., it has no parent).\n3. **Count the edges**: To calculate the height of the root node, you need to count the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. To do this, you need to follow all the edges starting from the root node until you reach a leaf node or reach an edge that does not lead to a leaf node.\n\n\n\t* You can keep track of the number of edges traversed by maintaining a counter or a stack of visited nodes.\n\t* If you reach a leaf node, you can stop traversing and return the current edge count as the height of the root node.\n\t* If you reach an edge that does not lead to a leaf node, you can continue traversing along that edge until you reach a leaf node or exhaust all possible paths.\n4. **Output the answer**: Once you have calculated the height of the root node, you can output it as an integer answer.\n\nHere's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to parse and extract the height of the root node from the provided file:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define a regular expression to parse the file\nfile_regex = r\"(.*?)(\\->.*)\"\nnode_regex = r\"(.*)\"\nedge_regex = r\"\\1 -> (\\w+)\"\n\n# Read and parse the file\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    file_content = file.read()\n    nodes = re.findall(node_regex, file_content)\n    edges = re.findall(edge_regex, file_content)\n    root_node = None\n    edge_count = 0\n    leaf_node = None\n    for edge in edges:\n        if leaf_node is None or len(edge) > len(leaf_node):\n            leaf_node = edge\n        root_node = next((node for node in nodes if edge in nodes[node]), None)\n        if root_node is not None:\n            edge_count += 1\n    if leaf_node is not None:\n        height = edge_count - 1  # Subtract 1 for the root node itself\n        print(f\"The height of the root node is {height}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Cannot find a leaf node\")\n```\nThis code assumes that your input file is called \"file.txt\" and is stored in the current working directory.
