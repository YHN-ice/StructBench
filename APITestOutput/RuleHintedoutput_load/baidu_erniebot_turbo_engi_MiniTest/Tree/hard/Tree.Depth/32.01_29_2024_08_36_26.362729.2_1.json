        "To extract the depth of node \"uc\" from the given file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the file**: The file appears to be a tree structure where each line represents a node and its children. The format appears to be a simple text file with no special characters or delimiters.\n2. **Determine the syntax rules**: Based on the provided information, it appears that each line starts with a node name, followed by a sequence of edges indicating the node's children.\n3. **Parse the file line by line**: Starting from the first line, parse each line to extract the node name and its depth. You can use a loop to iterate through all lines and store the information in a data structure, such as a dictionary or list, as you go along.\n4. **Extract the depth of \"uc\"**: Once you have parsed all lines, look for the node name \"uc\" and its depth in the resulting data structure.\n5. **Validate and report the result**: Ensure that the extracted depth for \"uc\" is consistent with the provided answer (\"5\").

These libraries can make the parsing process easier by providing methods and syntax for navigating and extracting data from the file structure.\n\nRemember that depending on the size and complexity of the file, it may be necessary to use a streaming parser or handle large files in a more efficient way. Additionally, it's always advisable to validate and test your parsing process to ensure accuracy and reliability before relying on it for production purposes."
