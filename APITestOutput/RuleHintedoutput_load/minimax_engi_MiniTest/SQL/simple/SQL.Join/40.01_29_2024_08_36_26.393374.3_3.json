        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in NY are taller than 171?\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the rows in the file that contain information about people who work in NY. We can do this by looking at the 'location' column in the second table.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the height of these people. We can do this by looking at the 'height' column in the first table.\n\n3. Then, we need to compare the height of these people with 171. If the height is greater than 171, we count that person.\n\n4. Finally, we sum up the count of all such people to get the answer.\n\nLet's go through the file and perform these steps:\n\n1. We find the rows with 'location' as 'NY' in the second table:\n   - primeKey: d, location: CA\n   - primeKey: e, location: CA\n   - primeKey: f, location: GA\n   - primeKey: h, location: IL\n   - primeKey: i, location: TX\n\n2. We find the height of these people in the first table:\n   - primeKey: d, height: 186\n   - primeKey: e, height: 187\n   - primeKey: f, height: 202\n   - primeKey: h, height: 144\n   - primeKey: i, height: 121\n\n3. We compare the height with 171:\n   - primeKey: d, height: 186 (taller)\n   - primeKey: e, height: 187 (taller)\n   - primeKey: f, height: 202 (taller)\n   - primeKey: h, height: 144 (shorter)\n   - primeKey: i, height: 121 (shorter)\n\n4. We sum up the count of people taller than 171: 3\n\nSo, the answer to the question is 3."
