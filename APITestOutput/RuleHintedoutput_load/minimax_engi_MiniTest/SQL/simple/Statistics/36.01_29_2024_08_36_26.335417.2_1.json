        "To answer the question \"How many people work with salary more than 230884?\", we need to parse the file and extract the relevant information. Here's a step-by-step approach to tackle this problem:\n\n1. **Parse the File**: First, we need to parse the file to extract the data into a format that can be easily processed, such as a list of dictionaries or a pandas DataFrame.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Data**: In this case, we are interested in the `salary` column. We need to filter out the rows where the `salary` is greater than 230884.\n\n3. **Count the Matching Rows**: Once we have the relevant data, we can simply count the number of rows to get the answer to the question.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that demonstrates this approach using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the file into a pandas DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('file.csv')\n\n# Filter the DataFrame to include only rows where the salary is greater than 230884\nfiltered_df = df[df['salary'] > 230884]\n\n# Count the number of rows in the filtered DataFrame\ncount = filtered_df.shape[0]\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the file is in CSV format and that the salary column is named 'salary'. If the file format or column names are different, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly."
