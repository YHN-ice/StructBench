Here are some potential challenges:\n\n1. File Format: If the file format is non-standard or complex, it may require specialized parsing techniques or tools to extract the relevant data.\n\n2. Syntax Complexity: Special syntax or encoding within the file may necessitate understanding of domain-specific languages or formats.\n\n3. Data Consistency: Inconsistencies in data, such as differing formats for dates or missing values, can cause issues when trying to interpret the information correctly.\n\n4. Ambiguities: The file may contain ambiguous information that can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to difficulty in determining the correct answer.\n\n5. Large Datasets: If the file contains a large amount of data, it might be challenging to process it efficiently without performance issues.\n\n6. Error Handling: Corrupt data or unexpected errors in the file might need to be handled gracefully to avoid incorrect answers.\n\n7. PrimeKey Associations: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, it is important to accurately associate related rows and aggregate their information correctly.\n\n8. Context Understanding: The parser must understand the context of the questions and how they pertain to the data within the file to provide relevant answers.\n\n9. Data Privacy: There may be privacy concerns when dealing with sensitive information, and it's important to ensure that data is handled in compliance with regulations and ethical guidelines.\n\n10. Update Handling: If the data in the file is updated or changed after the parser has been developed, it may need to accommodate for those changes in structure or content.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, it may be necessary to preprocess the data for consistency, use robust parsing libraries or frameworks, implement error-checking mechanisms, and possibly employ machine learning techniques for context understanding and answering complex questions."
