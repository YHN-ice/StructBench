The file contains two sections: one for personal information and another for employment information. Each section is separated by a line with \"primeKey\tstatus\tsalary\tcompany\tlocation\".\n\n2. Next, we need to parse the file and extract the relevant information. We are interested in people who work in CA and are taller than 167.\n\n3. We can start by extracting the personal information for each person. This includes their height, which is stored in the \"height\" column.\n\n4. Then, we can extract the employment information for each person. This includes their location, which is stored in the \"location\" column.\n\n5. We need to find people who work in CA (location = CA) and are taller than 167 (height > 167).\n\n6.
