        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in GA are taller than 171?\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the rows in the data table that contain information about people who work in GA. We can do this by looking at the 'location' column and finding rows where the value is 'GA'.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the height of these individuals. We can do this by looking at the 'height' column in the same rows.\n\n3. Finally, we need to count the number of people who are taller than 171. We can do this by comparing the height values with 171 and counting the number of rows where the height is greater than 171.\n\nApplying these steps to the given data table, we find that there are no people who work in GA and are taller than 171. Therefore, the answer to the question is 0."
