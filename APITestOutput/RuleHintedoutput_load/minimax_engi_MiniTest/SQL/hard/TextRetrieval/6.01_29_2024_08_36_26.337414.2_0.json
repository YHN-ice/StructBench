        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Read the File**: First, you need to read the file and store its content in a variable. You can use a file reading function in your programming language to do this.\n\n2. **Parse the File**: Next, you need to parse the file to extract the relevant information. Since the file has a special format and syntax, you might need to write custom parsing logic.\n\n3. **Find the Record**: Once you have parsed the file, you need to find the record with the primeKey 'c'. You can do this by searching through the parsed data for the record that matches the primeKey.\n\n4. **Extract the Age**: Once you have found the record, you need to extract the age from it. In this case, the age is stored in the 'age' column.\n\n5. **Return the Answer**: Finally, you can return the age as the answer to the question.\n\nHere's an example of how you might do this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef get_age(file_path, prime_key):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as ***\n        ***\n\n    *** []\n    for line in lines:\n        fields = line.split('\\t')\n        if len(fields) == 7:\n            parsed_data.append({\n                'primeKey': fields[0],\n                'gender': fields[1],\n                'age': fields[2],\n                'name': fields[3],\n                'height': fields[4],\n                'weight': fields[5],\n                'color': fields[6]\n            })\n        elif len(fields) == 5:\n            parsed_data.append({\n                'primeKey': fields[0],\n                'status': fields[1],\n                'salary': fields[2],\n                'company': fields[3],\n                'location': fields[4]\n            })\n\n    for record in parsed_data:\n        if record['primeKey'] == prime_key:\n            return record['age']\n\n    return None\n\nfile_path = 'path/to/your/file.txt'\nprime_key = 'c'\nage = get_age"
