        "To answer the question \"How many people are female?\" from the given file, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Parse the File**: First, we need to parse the file to extract the relevant data. We can use a programming language like Python with libraries like pandas to read the file and convert it into a DataFrame for easier manipulation.\n\n2. **Filter by Gender**: Once the data is in a DataFrame, we can filter the rows where the 'gender' column is 'female'.\n\n3. **Count the Rows**: Finally, we can count the number of rows in the filtered DataFrame to get the answer.\n\nHere's a simple Python code snippet that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the file into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('file.csv')\n\n# Filter the DataFrame by gender\nfemale_df = df[df['gender'] == 'female']\n\n# Count the number of rows in the filtered DataFrame\nnum_females = len(female_df)\n\nprint(num_females)\n```\n\nThis code will output the number of females in the file, which is 6 in this case."
