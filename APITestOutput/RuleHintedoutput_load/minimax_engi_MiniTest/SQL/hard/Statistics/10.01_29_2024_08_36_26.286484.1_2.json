The parser must be familiar with the structure, delimiters, and conventions used in the file.\n\n2. **Data Integrity:** The file may contain errors, inconsistencies, or incomplete data that could lead to incorrect answers. Ensuring data integrity is crucial for accurate parsing.\n\n3. **Complex Relationships:** If the file contains complex relationships between entities that are not straightforward to decipher, additional logic might be needed to correctly parse and link related data.\n\n4. **Ambiguous References:** If there are ambiguous references or non-unique identifiers (primeKeys), distinguishing between different entities or rows that refer to the same person could be difficult.\n\n5. **Large Data Volume:** Handling large volumes of data may require efficient parsing algorithms to ensure timely responses.\n\n6. **Contextual Understanding:** Some questions may require contextual interpretation of the data beyond simple parsing. Understanding the context or domain may be necessary for accurate answers.\n\n7. **Updates and Changes:** If the file format or content is subject to frequent updates or changes, the parser must be able to adapt to these changes without compromising the accuracy of the answers.\n\n8. **Technical Limitations:** The capabilities of the parser, such as memory limits, processing speed, and supported operations, might limit the ability to process the file or answer certain types of questions.\n\n9. **Special Characters and Encoding:** The file might include special characters or utilize specific encoding that needs to be handled correctly to avoid misinterpretation of data.\n\n10. **Security and Privacy:** Depending on the content of the file, there may be security and privacy concerns that need to be addressed when parsing and providing answers from the data.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser must be well-designed with robust error handling, capable of interpreting complex relationships, efficient in processing large datasets, adaptable to changes, and cognizant of any security and privacy requirements."
