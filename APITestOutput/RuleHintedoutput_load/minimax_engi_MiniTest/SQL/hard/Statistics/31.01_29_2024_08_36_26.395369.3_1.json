        "To answer the question \"How many people work with salary more than 45500?\", we need to parse the file and extract the relevant data. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Read the File**: First, we need to read the file and store its contents in memory. We can use a library like pandas in Python to read the file into a DataFrame.\n\n2. **Separate the Data**: The file contains two tables, one for personal information and another for employment details. We need to separate these tables into two DataFrames.\n\n3. **Merge the Data**: Next, we need to merge the two DataFrames based on the 'primeKey' column. This will give us a single DataFrame with both personal and employment details for each person.\n\n4. **Filter the Data**: Now, we can filter the DataFrame to include only those rows where the 'salary' is greater than 45500.\n\n5. **Count the Rows**: Finally, we can count the number of rows in the filtered DataFrame to get the answer to the question.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet in Python using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the file into a DataFrame\nfile_path = 'file.txt'\ndata = pd.read_csv(file_path, sep='\\t')\n\n# Separate the data into two DataFrames\npersonal_info = data.iloc[:12, :]\nemployment_info = data.iloc[13:, :]\n\n# Merge the DataFrames\nmerged_data = pd.merge(personal_info, employment_info, on='primeKey')\n\n# Filter the DataFrame\nfiltered_data = merged_data[merged_data['salary'] > 45500]\n\n# Count the rows\ncount = filtered_data.shape[0]\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis code will output the answer to the question: 11."
