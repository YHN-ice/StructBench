ORG files often contain structured text with elements like headings, lists, tables, and more, which have their own unique markers or syntax.\n\n2. **Hierarchy and Structure**: ORG files typically have hierarchical structures that can be nested at different levels. Interpreting this correctly is essential to retrieving accurate information.\n\n3. **Special Characters and Markers**: The file might use special characters or markers to denote different types of content (e.g., asterisks for headings, slashes for italics). These need to be correctly interpreted in the context of the file.\n\n4. **Metadata**: ORG files can contain metadata that might not be immediately visible in the content but may be necessary to understand to answer questions related to document properties or settings.\n\n5. **Links and References**: There could be links or references to other parts of the document or external resources that need to be resolved to answer the question fully.\n\n6. **Dynamic Content**: ORG files can include dynamic blocks or embedded code that generates content. If the question pertains to such content, one might need to execute or simulate the execution of this code to obtain the correct answer.\n\n7. **Embedded Data**: Data may be embedded in tables or as part of a structured list, which requires proper parsing to extract relevant information.\n\n8. **Contextual Understanding**: Questions may require an understanding of the context beyond just the structural parsing of the file, such as interpreting the meaning of written text or deducing intent from the organization of content.\n\n9. **File Version and Compatibility**: There could be differences in syntax and features between different versions of ORG files or the software used to create them, which can affect how the file should be parsed.\n\n10. **Encoding and Format Issues**: The file encoding must be correctly handled to ensure special characters are read properly. Additionally, if the file format has been corrupted or does not conform to standards, it can lead to parsing errors.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser must have a robust understanding of the ORG file syntax, be able to handle hierarchical and structured content accurately, correctly interpret special formatting characters, resolve any dynamic content, and provide contextual understanding where necessary."
