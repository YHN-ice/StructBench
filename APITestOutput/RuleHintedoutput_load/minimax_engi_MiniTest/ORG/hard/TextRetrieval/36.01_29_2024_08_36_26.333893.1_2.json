Understanding the structure and hierarchy of these elements is crucial for accurate parsing.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Structure**: ORG files are structured hierarchically with sections and subsections. The parser must maintain this hierarchy to understand the context of each piece of information.\n\n3. **Metadata**: ORG files may contain metadata in the form of tags, properties, or drawer sections. Accurately extracting and interpreting this metadata is essential for some queries.\n\n4. **Embedded Content**: ORG files can include embedded content like source code blocks, LaTeX expressions, or links. The parser should correctly handle such content without misinterpreting it as a regular text.\n\n5. **Tables**: ORG files can contain tables that might require special processing to understand and interpret the data within them correctly.\n\n6. **Dynamic Content**: ORG files can include dynamic blocks or macros that generate content based on certain rules or scripts. Static parsing might not capture the content that these dynamic features produce.\n\n7. **Link Resolution**: If the file contains links to other documents or external resources, resolving these links might be necessary to provide complete answers.\n\n8. **Todo Items and Planning Information**: ORG files often include tasks with TODO states, deadlines, and scheduled dates that could be relevant to certain questions.\n\n9. **Variations in User Customization**: Since Org mode is highly customizable, users might have their unique configurations that affect how the file should be interpreted (e.g., custom TODO keywords, tags, or properties).\n\n10. **Encoding and Character Sets**: The text encoding and character sets used in the file can affect parsing, especially if it includes non-ASCII characters.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser needs to:\n\n- Understand the ORG mode syntax and its various features.\n- Maintain the hierarchical structure of the document during parsing.\n- Recognize and process different types of elements (headings, lists, tables, etc.).\n- Handle metadata, links, and dynamic content appropriately.\n- Be robust enough to manage user customizations and variations in formatting.\n- Deal with different text encodings and character sets.\n\nOnce these challenges are dealt with, the parser should be able to extract relevant information from the ORG file to answer questions about its"
