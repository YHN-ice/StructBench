Extracting information accurately may require understanding and navigating this structure.\n\n3. **Embedded Code or Special Blocks**: The file might contain source code blocks or special blocks (like quote or verse blocks) that need to be treated differently from regular text.\n\n4. **Metadata Extraction**: ORG files can include metadata like TODO states, tags, properties, timestamps, etc. Parsing this metadata correctly could be crucial depending on the question asked.\n\n5. **Dynamic Content**: Some ORG files may include dynamic content that is generated when the file is processed by an interpreter (like Emacs). Static parsing may not capture this content accurately.\n\n6. **Links and File References**: The file might reference other files or external links that are relevant to the question. Deciding whether and how to follow these could be challenging.\n\n7. **Textual Ambiguity**: The natural language text within the file could be ambiguous or unclear, making it difficult to extract the correct information.\n\n8. **Performance Concerns**: If the ORG file is very large, parsing it efficiently without performance issues could be a concern.\n\n9. **Encoding and Format Compatibility**: Ensuring that the file encoding and format are compatible with the parser used is important to avoid parsing errors.\n\n10. **Keeping Up-To-Date with ORG Mode Updates**: ORG mode is updated regularly, and new features or syntax changes could affect how the file should be parsed.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it would be important to use a parsing approach that is sensitive to the structure of ORG files, can handle various types of content, and is flexible enough to deal with unexpected or complex cases."
