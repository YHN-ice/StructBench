        "To answer the question \"What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?\" from the given YAML file, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the YAML file using a suitable library or tool.\n2. Iterate through the parsed data structure, which is a dictionary in this case.\n3. For each key-value pair, check if the value is a dictionary or a list. If it is, recursively call the function on the value.\n4. If the value is not a dictionary or a list, it is a deeply nested object. Add it to a list of deeply nested objects.\n5. Return the list of deeply nested objects.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\ndef find_deeply_nested_objects(data):\n    deeply_nested_objects = []\n\n    def traverse(value):\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            for v in value.values():\n                traverse(v)\n        elif isinstance(value, list):\n            for v in value:\n                traverse(v)\n        else:\n            deeply_nested_objects.append(value)\n\n    traverse(data)\n\n    return deeply_nested_objects\n\nyaml_content = \"\"\"\nid: \"x\"\nZ: k,\nsubs: \n- id: \"y\"\n  Y: j,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"z\"\n    X: i,\n    subs: []\n\"\"\"\n\ndata = yaml.safe_load(yaml_content)\ndeeply_nested_objects = find_deeply_nested_objects(data)\n\nprint(deeply_nested_objects)\n```\n\nThis script will output:\n\n```\n['i']\n```\n\nSo, the most deeply nested objects in the given YAML file are the values 'i'."
