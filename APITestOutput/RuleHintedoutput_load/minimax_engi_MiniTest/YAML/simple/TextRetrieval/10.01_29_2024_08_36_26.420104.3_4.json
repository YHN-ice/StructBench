A parser must correctly handle these data types to return accurate information.\n\n4. **Implicit vs. Explicit Data Types**: YAML is designed to be easily readable by humans, which means it often relies on implicit typing.

A parser needs to support both and interpret them correctly.\n\n7. **Comments and White Spaces**: While comments and extra white spaces are ignored by the YAML parser, ensuring that they do not interfere with the interpretation of the data structure is necessary.\n\n8. **Version Differences**: Different versions of YAML (1.1, 1.2, etc.) might have slightly different specifications.
