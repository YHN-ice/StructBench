A small mistake in indentation can lead to incorrect interpretation of the data hierarchy.\n\n3. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types like scalars, sequences, and mappings. Knowing how these are represented and how to extract them is crucial.\n\n4. **References & Anchors**: YAML allows for the use of anchors and aliases to reduce redundancy. Understanding and appropriately resolving these references is important for accurate data retrieval.\n\n5. **Variable Substitution**: Some YAML files may include variables that need to be substituted with actual values during parsing, which requires additional processing logic.\n\n6. **Large Files**: Large YAML files can be difficult to process efficiently. Efficient searching and access strategies will be needed to quickly find relevant information.\n\n7. **Compatibility Issues**: There might be differences in how various parsers interpret the YAML specification. Ensuring compatibility with the specific nuances of the provided file is essential.\n\n8. **Missing or Incorrect Data**: If the file is incomplete or contains errors, it may not be possible to accurately answer questions based on it.\n\n9. **Encoding**: Handling different file encodings properly is important to ensure that characters are interpreted correctly.\n\n10. **Comments and Documentation**: YAML allows for comments, which are not part of the actual data.
