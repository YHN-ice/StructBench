Understanding where and how they are used is necessary to answer questions correctly.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: Special characters in YAML (e.g., \":,\", \"'\") can affect the parsing of data if used incorrectly.\n\n6. **Multi-document Files**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. Each document must be parsed separately.\n\n7. **Comments**: YAML supports comments using the `#` symbol. Parsing must ignore these comments to accurately interpret the data.\n\n8. **Variations in Syntax**: Different versions of YAML or different interpretations by parsers can lead to variations in how the YAML is read and understood.\n\n9. **External References**: If the YAML file makes reference to external files or includes data from them, it might be necessary to have access to those files.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: If the YAML file uses a non-standard character encoding, it may need special handling to be read correctly.\n\nTo get the correct answers from a YAML file, you need a systematic approach to navigate through its contents while handling all of these potential obstacles efficiently."

The YAML file is parsed, and the structure is navigated to find the first object under the 'subs' key.
