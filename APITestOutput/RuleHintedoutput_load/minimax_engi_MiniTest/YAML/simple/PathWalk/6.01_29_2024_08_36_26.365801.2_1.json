Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Complex Structure**: YAML supports complex structures including nested lists and dictionaries (maps). Understanding the hierarchy and relationships within these structures is crucial to retrieving the correct information.\n\n2. **Indentation Sensitivity**: YAML relies on indentation to define structure. Inconsistent or incorrect indentation could lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the data hierarchy.\n\n3. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, dates, and more. Identifying and correctly handling the expected data type is important for accurate interpretation.\n\n4. **Aliases & Anchors**: YAML allows the use of anchors and aliases to avoid repetition. If implemented, understanding and resolving these references is necessary for a complete understanding of the data.\n\n5. **Multiline Strings**: Handling multiline strings with proper formatting can be tricky, especially if there are literal block scalar indicators (`|`) or folded block scalar indicators (`>`).\n\n6. **Special Characters**: Special characters in YAML (e.g., `:`, `-`, `!`, `&`, `*`) have specific meanings or are used for advanced features like custom tags or aliases, and must be correctly interpreted.\n\n7. **Implicit and Explicit Types**: YAML has a concept of type coercion based on the value's format (implicit types). Ensuring that the parser correctly interprets the type intended by the file's author is important, as is recognizing when explicit type declaration is used.\n\n8. **Comments**: Ignoring comments which are not part of the data itself but may be included for human readers.\n\n9. **Version Differences**: Being aware of and compatible with different versions of the YAML specification since there are subtle differences that can affect parsing.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: Ensuring that the file's character encoding is correctly handled, especially if it contains non-ASCII characters.\n\n11. **Large Files**: Handling large datasets efficiently without running into memory or performance issues.\n\n12. **Security Risks**: Being cautious about executing arbitrary code through YAML, since some parsers allow for complex object creation that could be a security risk.\n\n13. **External References**: Some YAML files might include external references or directives to include content from other files, which would require additional handling.\n\n14. **Schema Validation**: If a certain schema is expected for the YAML data, validating the input against this schema to ensure it conforms to the expected format.\n\nOvercoming"

Parse the YAML file using the chosen library, which will convert the YAML data into a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or an object) that represents the hierarchy and relationships within the file.\n\n3.
