        "To answer the question \"What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?\", we need to parse the YAML file and traverse through its structure. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Parse the YAML File**: Use a YAML parser to load the YAML file into a data structure, such as a dictionary or an object.\n\n2. **Traverse the Data Structure**: Start from the root of the data structure and traverse through its keys and values.\n\n3. **Check for Lists and Dictionaries**: For each key-value pair, check if the value is a list or a dictionary. If it is, skip this value and continue to the next key-value pair.\n\n4. **Check for Nested Objects**: If the value is not a list or a dictionary, check if it's a nested object (i.e., another dictionary). If it is, recursively traverse through this nested object using the same process.\n\n5. **Identify the Most Nested Objects**: Keep track of the most deeply nested objects that do not contain any lists or dictionaries as values.\n\n6. **Return the Results**: After traversing through the entire data structure, return the identified most deeply nested objects.\n\nIn this case, the most deeply nested objects are:\n\n- id: \"d\"\n  W: g,\n  subs: []\n\n- id: \"e\"\n  V: f,\n  U: e,\n  subs: []\n\n- id: \"g\"\n  S: c,\n  R: b,\n  subs: []\n\n- id: \"h\"\n  Q: a,\n  subs: []\n\n- id: \"k\"\n  L: vy,\n  subs: []\n\n- id: \"l\"\n  K: uy,\n  subs: []\n\n- id: \"n\"\n  I: sy,\n  subs: []\n\n- id: \"o\"\n  H: ry,\n  subs: []"
