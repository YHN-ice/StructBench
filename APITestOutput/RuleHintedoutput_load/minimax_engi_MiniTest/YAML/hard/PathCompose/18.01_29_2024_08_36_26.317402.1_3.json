Complex Structure: YAML files can have nested structures with multiple levels of hierarchy. Understanding and navigating through this tree-like structure to extract the correct information can be challenging.\n\n2. Indentation Sensitivity: YAML relies on indentation to denote structure. If the indentation is incorrect or inconsistent, it can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the data hierarchy.\n\n3. Data Types: YAML supports various data types like scalars (e.g., strings, integers), lists, and dictionaries. Ensuring that the parser correctly identifies and handles each data type is crucial for accurate data retrieval.\n\n4. Aliases and Anchors: YAML allows for the definition of aliases and anchors to avoid repetition. A parser must be able to resolve these references to the actual values they represent.\n\n5. Special Characters: Handling special characters and ensuring they are parsed correctly (e.g., colons in strings, special indicators like '---' for document start) is important.\n\n6. Multiline Strings: YAML supports multiline strings which can be represented in different ways (e.g., with `|` for literal blocks, `>` for folded blocks). The parser must handle these correctly to maintain the intended formatting.\n\n7. Implicit vs. Explicit Typing: YAML has implicit typing, which can sometimes incorrectly guess the type of a value (e.g., interpreting a version number \"1.0\" as a float). The parser may need to enforce explicit typing where necessary.\n\n8. Merging Key-Value Pairs: YAML supports merging of key-value pairs using '<<'. The parser must be able to perform this merge correctly when encountered.\n\n9. Custom Tags and Extensions: Some YAML files might use custom tags or rely on extensions that are not part of the core YAML specification, which could complicate parsing.\n\n10. File Encoding and Character Sets: The parser must handle file encoding correctly, especially if the YAML file contains non-ASCII characters.\n\n11. Comments: While comments (starting with `#`) are not part of the data model, a parser should recognize and ignore them to prevent them from being interpreted as data.\n\n12.
