        "To extract all included figure files from the given LaTeX file and print their names separated by \\n, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the LaTeX file to identify the `\\includegraphics` command, which is used to include images or figures in the document.\n2. Extract the file name from the argument of the `\\includegraphics` command. The file name is typically enclosed in curly braces `{}`.\n3. Store the extracted file names in a list or array.\n4. Iterate through the list or array and print each file name on a new line.\n\nHere's a Python-like pseudocode for this process:\n\n```python\nfile_names = []\n\nwith open('file.tex', 'r') as ***\n    ***\n        ***'\\includegraphics' in line:\n            # Extract file name from line\n            file_name = line.split(r'\\includegraphics')[1].split('}')[0]\n            file_names.append(file_name)\n\nfor file_name in file_names:\n    print(file_name)\n```\n\nThis code opens the LaTeX file, reads each line, and checks if it contains the `\\includegraphics` command. If it does, the file name is extracted and added to the `file_names` list. Finally, the code iterates through the list and prints each file name on a new line.\n\nNote that this is a simplified approach and might not handle all edge cases or complex LaTeX structures. A more robust solution would involve using a LaTeX parsing library or tool that can accurately interpret the document's structure and content."
