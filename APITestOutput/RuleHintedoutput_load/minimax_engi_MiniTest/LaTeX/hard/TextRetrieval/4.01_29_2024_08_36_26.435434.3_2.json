Understanding the commands and environments requires knowledge of the LaTeX language.\n\n2. **Commands and Environments:** LaTeX documents use various commands (prefixed with a backslash `\\`) and environments (defined by `\\begin{...}` and `\\end{...}`) to format text. Some of these may not be standard and could be defined in the preamble or external packages, which means one might need to interpret or look up custom commands.\n\n3. **Nested Structures:** LaTeX documents can contain nested structures, like itemized lists within custom environments or tables with embedded math expressions. Keeping track of the nesting and extracting the relevant information accurately can be tricky.\n\n4. **Math Mode:** If the file contains mathematical expressions, they will be in a special math mode environment (e.g., `$...$`, `\\[...\\]`, `\\begin{equation}...\\end{equation}`), which has its own set of rules and symbols distinct from the regular text.\n\n5. **Conditional Compilation:** LaTeX allows for conditional compilation using commands like `\\if... \\fi`. The output might depend on flags that determine which parts of the text are compiled.\n\n6. **Comments and Whitespace:** Comments (using `%`) are ignored by LaTeX compilers but may contain relevant information for understanding the document's context. Additionally, LaTeX is generally whitespace-agnostic, which might make parsing for human-readable content challenging.\n\n7. **External Dependencies:** The document might reference external files or packages that are not present in the input, which could be essential for proper compilation and interpretation.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues:** LaTeX files can be saved with different text encodings, which might affect how special characters are processed and displayed.\n\nOvercoming these obstacles would require a parser that can interpret LaTeX syntax, manage custom and built-in environments, handle special character processing, and potentially simulate the role of a LaTeX compiler to some extent to predict the output accurately."
