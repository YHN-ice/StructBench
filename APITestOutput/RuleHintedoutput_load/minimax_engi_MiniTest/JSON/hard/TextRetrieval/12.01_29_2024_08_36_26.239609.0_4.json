However, since I am an AI language model and do not have the functionality of parsing files or accessing external content, I will outline the general challenges and obstacles that might be faced when extracting information from a JSON file with special format and syntax:\n\n1. **Complex Structure**: JSON files can have nested objects and arrays, which can make traversing the structure to find the correct piece of information challenging. Understanding the hierarchy and path to the desired data is crucial.\n\n2. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is quite large, it may be difficult to process it efficiently. Large files may require streaming or chunked processing to avoid memory issues.\n\n3. **Data Types and Formats**: JSON supports various data types including strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring that the data is correctly interpreted, especially dates and specialized formats, can be an issue.\n\n4. **Special Syntax**: If the file contains special syntax or non-standard structures within strings or as part of its format, it may require custom parsing logic to correctly interpret these elements.\n\n5. **Encoding**: JSON is typically encoded in UTF-8, but if the file is in a different encoding, it might cause issues with parsing and interpreting the characters.\n\n6. **Versioning and Schema Changes**: If the file’s schema has multiple versions or has changed over time, understanding which version you are working with is important to parse it correctly.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: Malformed JSON or unexpected data types (e.g., a string where a number is expected) can cause errors during parsing. Proper error handling and validation are necessary.\n\n8. **Security**: JSON files can be a vector for security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks if they are used in a web context and not properly sanitized.\n\n9. **Tool Compatibility**: The tools or libraries used to parse the JSON might have limitations or bugs that could affect the accuracy of the parsing.\n\nIn a practical scenario, to address these challenges, one would typically use a programming language with robust JSON parsing libraries (such as Python's `json` module, JavaScript's `JSON.parse`, or Java's `JSONObject`) that handle most of these difficulties and provide a convenient way to navigate through the JSON structure to retrieve the necessary information. It's also important to have good error handling and possibly schema validation to ensure that the JSON data conforms to expected formats."

        "To extract the most deeply nested objects from the given JSON file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the JSON file into a JSON object or dictionary using a JSON parsing library in your preferred programming language.\n\n2. Define a recursive function to traverse the JSON object or dictionary. This function should take an object or dictionary as input and return a list of the most deeply nested objects.\n\n3. In the recursive function, check if the input is a dictionary. If it is, iterate through its values. If a value is a dictionary or a list, call the recursive function on that value. If a value is not a dictionary or a list, add it to the list of deeply nested objects.\n\n4. If the input is a list, iterate through its elements. If an element is a dictionary or a list, call the recursive function on that element. If an element is not a dictionary or a list, add it to the list of deeply nested objects.\n\n5. Return the list of deeply nested objects.\n\nHere's a Python example using the `json` module:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef extract_deeply_nested_objects(obj):\n    deeply_nested = []\n    if isinstance(obj, dict):\n        for value in obj.values():\n            deeply_nested.extend(extract_deeply_nested_objects(value))\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        for element in obj:\n            deeply_nested.extend(extract_deeply_nested_objects(element))\n    else:\n        deeply_nested.append(obj)\n    return deeply_nested\n\nwith open('file.json', 'r') as ***\n    ***\n\n***\n```\n\nThis code will extract the most deeply nested objects from the JSON file and store them in the `deeply_nested_objects` list."
