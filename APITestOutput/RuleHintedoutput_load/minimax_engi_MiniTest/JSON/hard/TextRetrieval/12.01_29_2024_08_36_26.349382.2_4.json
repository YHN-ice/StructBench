Stream processing or chunking data may be required.\n\n4. **Encoding**: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. Issues with encoding could result in errors or incorrect parsing of the data.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: JSON format is strict, and even minor syntax errors can prevent the file from being parsed correctly. Common errors include missing quotes around strings, extra or missing commas, or incorrect bracket pairing.\n\n6. **Date and Time Formats**: JSON itself does not have a standard format for dates and times, which might be represented as strings. Converting these to actual date/time objects might need additional parsing logic.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Special characters in JSON are escaped with a backslash (\\). Parsers must handle these escape sequences correctly to avoid misinterpreting data.\n\n8. **Version Compatibility**: The tool or library used for parsing might have compatibility issues with different versions of JSON or might not support certain features.\n\n9. **Security Concerns**: If the JSON is coming from an untrusted source, there could be security implications such as injection attacks or executing malicious code embedded within the JSON.\n\n10. **Schema Validation**: Ensuring that the JSON data adheres to a predefined schema might be necessary for certain applications and requires additional validation steps.\n\nTo successfully parse a JSON file and answer questions about its contents, one would need to handle these potential issues effectively.
