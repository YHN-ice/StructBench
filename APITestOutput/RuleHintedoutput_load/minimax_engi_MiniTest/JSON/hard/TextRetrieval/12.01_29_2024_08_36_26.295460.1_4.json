        "To get the answer from the file, we need to navigate through the nested structure and find the objects that do not contain any list or dictionary values. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Start from the root of the JSON file, which is the object with the key \"id\" and value \"u\".\n2. Iterate through the \"subs\" array of the root object.\n3. For each object in the \"subs\" array, check if it contains any list or dictionary values. If it does not, add it to a list of deeply nested objects.\n4. Continue this process recursively for each object in the \"subs\" array until all objects have been checked.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this approach:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_deeply_nested_objects(obj, deeply_nested_objects):\n    if isinstance(obj, dict):\n        if not any(isinstance(value, (list, dict)) for value in obj.values()):\n            deeply_nested_objects.append(obj)\n        else:\n            for value in obj.values():\n                find_deeply_nested_objects(value, deeply_nested_objects)\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        for item in obj:\n            find_deeply_nested_objects(item, deeply_nested_objects)\n\nwith open('file.json', 'r') as ***\n    ***\n    *** []\n    find_deeply_nested_objects(data, deeply_nested_objects)\n\nprint(deeply_nested_objects)\n```\n\nThis code will print the list of deeply nested objects from the JSON file."
