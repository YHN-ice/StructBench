Ensuring that the extracted data is of the correct type for further operations can be tricky.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: JSON files are generally UTF-8 encoded, but there could be encoding issues which lead to problems when parsing special characters.\n\n5. **Schema Validation**: Without a schema or clear understanding of the expected structure, it could be difficult to parse the JSON file correctly.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: JSON files must adhere to a strict syntax. Even small mistakes like missing commas or extra braces can cause parsing errors.\n\n7. **Query Complexity**: If the question requires complex queries or aggregations of the JSON data, this may add additional layers of difficulty in extracting the correct information.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Questions**: Sometimes the question might be vague or open to interpretation, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact information needed.\n\n9. **Updates and Versioning**: If the JSON file is subject to updates and changes, keeping track of versions and ensuring compatibility with the parser can be an issue.\n\n10. **Performance Constraints**: If the parser needs to handle a high volume of requests or process data quickly, performance optimization becomes critical.\n\nFor specific problems, you would need a customized approach to tackle these obstacles, which could involve using specialized parsing libraries, writing custom parsing code, or employing additional tools for data transformation and analysis."
