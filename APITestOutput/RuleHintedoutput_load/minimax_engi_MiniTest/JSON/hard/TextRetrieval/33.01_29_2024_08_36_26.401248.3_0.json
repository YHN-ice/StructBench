Large files can lead to longer processing times and increased memory consumption.\n\n3. **Data Types**: JSON supports various data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. Ensuring that the data is interpreted with the correct type is essential to provide accurate answers.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: The file may contain characters that are not properly encoded, leading to parsing errors or incorrect interpretations of the data.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: Any syntax error in the JSON file, like missing commas or brackets, can prevent the file from being parsed correctly.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Questions**: If the question is ambiguous or doesn't correspond precisely to the structure and semantics of the data in the JSON file, it may be difficult to determine what information is being requested.\n\n7. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: If the necessary data to answer the question is missing or incomplete within the JSON file, it may not be possible to provide an answer.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, it's important to have a good understanding of the JSON format, robust error handling in place, efficient search algorithms for navigating through the data, and clear communication regarding any ambiguities or incomplete information in both the question and the data provided."
