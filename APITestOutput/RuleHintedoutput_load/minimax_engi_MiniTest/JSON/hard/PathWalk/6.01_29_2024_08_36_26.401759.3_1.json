These include:\n\n1. **Complex and Nested Structures**: JSON files can contain deeply nested structures which may require recursive parsing or maintaining a stack/queue to navigate through the hierarchy efficiently.\n\n2. **Large File Sizes**: If the JSON file is very large, this could pose memory issues or require stream-based parsing techniques to handle the file in chunks.\n\n3. **Data Types and Formats**: JSON supports various data types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. Ensuring correct handling of these types and converting them to proper native data structures for processing can be challenging.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: File encoding (UTF-8, ASCII, etc.) might not match the expected encoding leading to parsing errors or incorrect interpretation of the data.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: The JSON file might contain syntax errors such as missing commas, unclosed brackets, or misplaced quotes, which can break standard parsers.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Keys**: JSON objects are key-value pairs. There could be ambiguity if keys are non-unique or if there is an unexpected nesting of keys.\n\n7. **Dynamic Schema**: If the JSON file does not adhere to a fixed schema, it can be difficult to predict the structure and extract information reliably.\n\n8. **Special Characters**: Handling special characters and ensuring they are correctly parsed and represented in the output can be an issue, particularly in strings.\n\n9. **Questions Requiring Contextual Understanding**: Questions that require an understanding of the context or intent behind the data might be difficult to address solely through parsing.\n\n10. **Updates in JSON Format**: If the JSON standard is updated and new features are added that are not supported by the current parser version, this could lead to issues.\n\n11. **Security Concerns**: Care must be taken to avoid security vulnerabilities, such as code injection through maliciously crafted JSON content.\n\n12. **File Accessibility**: There could be issues with file access permissions or file not being available at the expected location.\n\nTo deal with these obstacles, various strategies such as schema validation, error handling, memory management, and utilizing robust parsing libraries might be employed. Additionally, defining clear specifications for the JSON file format and having thorough documentation on the expected structure can help mitigate errors during parsing."
