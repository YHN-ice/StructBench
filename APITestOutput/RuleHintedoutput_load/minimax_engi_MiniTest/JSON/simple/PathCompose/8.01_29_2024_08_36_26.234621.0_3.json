Ensuring that the correct data type is used when interpreting the file is crucial.\n\n4. **Missing or Inconsistent Data**: If the expected keys or values are missing or inconsistent with the structure described in the QA, it can lead to incorrect answers or an inability to process the file.\n\n5. **Special Characters and Encoding**: Special characters or different encoding formats may cause issues if not handled properly.\n\n6. **Schema Changes**: If the schema of the JSON file changes (new keys are added, existing keys are removed or renamed), it may require updates to the logic used to parse and understand the file.\n\n7. **Accessing Deeply Nested Values**: Retrieving data that is deeply nested within the JSON structure might require complex traversal methods.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: Handling various errors such as parsing errors, missing keys, or unexpected data types is essential for robust processing.\n\n9. **Versioning and Documentation**: If there are multiple versions of the file format, it's important to ensure that the parser is designed for the correct version. Lack of proper documentation can also be an obstacle.\n\n10. **Performance Optimization**: For time-sensitive applications, optimizing the parsing procedure to be as efficient as possible will be a challenge.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, I would need to carefully analyze the given JSON file's structure, ensure proper error handling mechanisms are in place, and possibly use a schema or sample of expected format to validate and navigate through the data efficiently."
