Identifying the correct key that corresponds to the question may not always be straightforward, especially if the keys are not named intuitively.\n\n3. **Data Types**: JSON supports various data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring that the extracted data is in the correct type and format as expected in the question is crucial.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is particularly large, it may be more difficult to quickly parse and retrieve information due to potential performance issues.\n\n5. **Encoding and Special Characters**: Proper handling of encoding and special characters in strings is necessary to avoid misinterpretation of the data.\n\n6. **Array Indexing**: If the data is contained within arrays, knowing the correct index or using a proper method to search through arrays is necessary.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Queries**: The questions themselves might be ambiguous or lack sufficient context, making it unclear which part of the JSON file contains the relevant answer.\n\n8. **Updates and Synchronization**: If the JSON file is subject to frequent updates, ensuring that the parser is working with the most current version of the data can be a challenge.\n\n9. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is essential to deal with missing keys, unexpected data formats, parsing errors, or other anomalies in the file.\n\n10. **File Accessibility and Permissions**: If there are issues with file accessibility or permissions, that could prevent the parser from even reading the JSON data.\n\nUnderstanding these potential challenges can help in preparing a more robust strategy for parsing the JSON file and retrieving the necessary information to answer questions accurately."
