Understanding the hierarchy and path to the desired data can be challenging.\n\n2. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be difficult to process it all at once due to memory constraints. This may require streaming the file and processing it in chunks.\n\n3. **Data Types and Formats**: Ensuring that the data is in the expected format and type is important. JSON supports basic data types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects, but special formatting (like dates or custom objects) may require additional parsing logic.\n\n4. **Key Variability**: Sometimes, JSON keys aren't consistent throughout the file, which can make it hard to query the file programmatically.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file includes special characters or is not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), it might cause issues when parsing.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: JSON is strict in its syntax. Missing commas, quotation marks, or brackets can cause the entire file to be unreadable.\n\n7. **Versioning**: If the structure of the JSON changes between versions (for example, if an API changes its response format), code that worked with an older version of the file may not work with the newer version.\n\nTo overcome these potential obstacles, careful planning and robust programming practices are essential. This includes writing code that:\n\n- Handles errors gracefully.\n- Accounts for variability in key names.\n- Is flexible enough to handle changes in data structure.\n- Manages memory usage efficiently for large files.\n- Validates the format and type of data.\n- Utilizes libraries or tools that are designed for parsing and querying JSON.\n\nOnce I have more details about the specific JSON file and the question, I'll be able to provide a more tailored response to how to get the answer from the file."
