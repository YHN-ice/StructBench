Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Nested Structures:** JSON files can have deeply nested structures, which may make it harder to navigate and extract the necessary information.\n\n2. **Large File Size:** If the JSON file is very large, it can be challenging to process it efficiently without running into memory or performance issues.\n\n3. **Dynamic Schema:** If the JSON does not have a fixed schema, or if the structure varies from one part of the file to another, it can complicate the extraction of information as you cannot rely on a consistent path to the data.\n\n4. **Data Types:** JSON supports various data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring that data is correctly interpreted and handled according to its type is crucial.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues:** If the file contains characters that are not properly encoded (e.g., special characters or different language scripts), it could lead to parsing errors or incorrect data interpretation.\n\n6. **Key-Value Pairs:** JSON is based on key-value pairs. Typos or variations in key names can lead to missed or incorrectly extracted data.\n\n7. **Array Indexing:** When dealing with arrays, you need to be careful with indexing. Accessing an index that doesn't exist can cause errors.\n\n8. **Date Formats:** Dates in JSON are typically stored as strings. If questions require interpretation of dates, you will need logic to parse these string representations into actual date objects for comparison or calculation.\n\n9. **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is required to gracefully manage any unexpected data formats, missing keys, or other anomalies in the JSON file.\n\n10. **Versioning and Updates:** If the format of the JSON file changes over time (e.g., due to updates or versioning), the parser might need to be updated to accommodate these changes.\n\nTo give correct answers from a JSON file, you must be able to read the file, understand its structure, navigate through its hierarchy, and accurately extract and interpret the relevant pieces of data in accordance with the questions asked."
