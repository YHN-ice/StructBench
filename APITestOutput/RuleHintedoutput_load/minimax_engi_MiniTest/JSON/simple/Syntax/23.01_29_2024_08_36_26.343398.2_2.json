The parser would need to handle or report these errors.\n\n2. **File Size**: Large files can be difficult to handle, especially if you're trying to load the entire file into memory. Stream-based parsing or chunk reading may be necessary.\n\n3. **Nested Structures**: JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays. Traversing these structures to retrieve the required information can be complex, and one needs to understand the structure well.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports various data types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, true, false, null). Ensuring that the data is correctly interpreted and processed in the context of the question is important.\n\n5. **Encoding**: JSON text exchanged between systems that are not part of a closed ecosystem must be encoded using UTF-8. Encoding issues can result in failure to correctly parse or interpret data.\n\n6. **Schema Changes**: If the schema of the JSON file changes (for example, field names change or the structure is altered), the parser's logic might need to be updated.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Questions**: The questions asked may be ambiguous or require interpretation that a simple parser isn't equipped to handle without additional logic.\n\n8. **Performance Constraints**: If the parser needs to be highly performant, then optimizations may be required to reduce processing time.\n\n9. **Security Concerns**: If user input is involved in constructing queries for the JSON data, there's a risk of injection attacks, so sanitizing input is crucial.\n\n10. **Path Notation**: Understanding how to navigate JSON with path notation (like JSONPath or XPath for XML) can simplify retrieval of complex data.\n\n11. **Missing or Null Values**: The JSON file might contain missing keys or null values which need to be handled gracefully by the parser in order to avoid unexpected errors.\n\n12. **Data Volume and Duplication**: If there are large amounts of data or repeated structures, it may be challenging to process them efficiently.\n\n13. **Type Coercion Issues**: The parser must correctly handle JSON's loose typing; for example, distinguishing between numeric values and numeric strings can sometimes lead to unexpected behaviors.\n\n14. **Tool"
