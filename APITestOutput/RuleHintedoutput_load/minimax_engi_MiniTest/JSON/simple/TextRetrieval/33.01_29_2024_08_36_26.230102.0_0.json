If the data type expected does not match the actual type in the JSON, this can cause issues in interpretation.\n\n8. **Versioning and Updates**: If the structure of the JSON data changes over time (due to updates or versioning), scripts or methods used to parse old versions might not work correctly with newer versions.\n\n9. **Security Concerns**: If there is sensitive information in the JSON file, care must be taken to ensure that only authorized questions are answered, and that data is handled securely.\n\n10. **Path Expressions Complexity**: When using path expressions (like JSONPath or XPath for JSON) to extract data, complex expressions can be error-prone and difficult to debug.\n\nTo successfully extract information from a JSON file, you must carefully consider these potential issues and ensure that your parser handles them appropriately. The parser should be robust, handle errors gracefully, and validate the structure of the JSON against expected schemas when possible."
