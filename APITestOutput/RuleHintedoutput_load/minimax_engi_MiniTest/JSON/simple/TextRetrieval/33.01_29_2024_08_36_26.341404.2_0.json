Ambiguities: The JSON file might contain ambiguous keys or values that require additional context to interpret correctly.\n\n4. Data Types: JSON supports various data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Handling these properly and converting them when necessary could pose a challenge.\n\n5. Encoding: JSON text must be properly encoded in UTF-8. If the file uses a different encoding, it may not be parsed correctly.\n\n6.
