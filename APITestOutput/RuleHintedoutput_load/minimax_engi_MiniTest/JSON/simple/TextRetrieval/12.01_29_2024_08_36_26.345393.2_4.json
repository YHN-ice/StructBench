Misinterpreting these types or querying them incorrectly can lead to errors or incorrect answers.\n\n7. **Incorrect Path/Key**:\n   Providing an incorrect path or key when looking for an answer within the file would result in a failure to retrieve the correct data.\n\n8. **Updates and Synchronization**:\n   If the JSON file is subject to updates while being parsed, then there could be synchronization issues leading to potentially reading outdated information.\n\n9. **Security Constraints**:\n   There might be security constraints that prevent accessing or parsing certain parts of the JSON file.\n\n10. **Tool Limitations**:\n    The parser tool or software being used might have limitations in terms of functionality or compatibility with certain JSON structures.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it's essential to ensure that the JSON file is well-formed, understand the structure and schema of the JSON data beforehand, clarify any ambiguous queries, handle data types appropriately, and use a reliable and capable parsing tool or library."
