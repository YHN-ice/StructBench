Parsing these correctly to extract plain text can be challenging.\n   - Nested or mixed formatting (e.g., a list within a blockquote) might require careful handling to maintain the structure and meaning of the content.\n\n2. **Ambiguity in Questions or Answers:**\n   - The question might be vague or have multiple interpretations, making it difficult to identify the correct answer.\n   - Answers might be provided in a way that requires context to understand, involving references to other parts of the document or external information.\n\n3. **Implicit Relationships:**\n   - The relationship between questions and answers might not be explicitly stated, requiring inference based on proximity or formatting cues.\n   - Additional context may be required from previous sections or headings to fully comprehend the question or answer.\n\n4. **Variability in Syntax:**\n   - Different documents might use different conventions for denoting questions and answers (e.g., Q: / A:, bold text, or different levels of headings).\n   - Inconsistent application of Markdown syntax could lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the content.\n\n5. **Links and References:**\n   - The file may contain hyperlinks or references that need to be resolved or followed to provide a complete answer.\n   - Handling images, footnotes, or other linked content can be complex if it is essential to the understanding of the QA.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Special Characters:**\n   - Code blocks need to be treated differently than regular text, especially if they contain sample code or commands.\n   - Special characters may be part of Markdown formatting or part of the content; distinguishing between these cases is necessary.\n\n7. **Stateful Context:**\n   - Some answers might rely on information provided in earlier parts of the document, so maintaining state or tracking previously mentioned facts could be required.\n\n8. **Non-Textual Content:**\n   - If the Markdown file includes tables, graphs, or other visual content, extracting meaningful text-based answers may not be possible without additional processing.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a Markdown file parser should employ robust parsing rules that can handle various Markdown syntax and structures.
