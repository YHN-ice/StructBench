Knowing which variant the file follows is crucial for correct interpretation.\n\n3. **Ambiguity in Formatting**: Sometimes the visual cues in Markdown (like italicized or bold text) are used for emphasis without a standard method of interpretation. This can lead to ambiguity in determining the importance or meaning of a piece of text.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML or Other Languages**: Markdown supports the inclusion of HTML and sometimes other languages like LaTex for more advanced formatting. Parsing these correctly can be challenging.\n\n5. **Links and Images**: Correctly interpreting and extracting links and image sources requires careful parsing, especially when dealing with reference-style links or images with titles and alt text.\n\n6. **Tables**: If the file contains tables, they must be parsed accurately to understand the structure and extract information from the correct cells.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Differentiating between code and regular text is crucial, especially since code blocks can contain text that looks like Markdown syntax but should not be interpreted as such.\n\n8. **Handling Metadata**: Some Markdown files may include metadata (like front-matter in Jekyll posts) that needs to be parsed separately from the main content.\n\n9. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax but are escaped to be shown as literals (e.g., \\*, \\_, etc.) should be handled correctly.\n\n10. **Incomplete or Incorrect Syntax**: Human error can lead to incorrect use of Markdown syntax, such as mismatched parentheses for links or unclosed tags, which can confuse parsers.\n\n11. **Content Extraction Logic**: Depending on the question at hand, you may need specific logic to extract and interpret the relevant content (for example, recognizing Q&A patterns).\n\n12. **Contextual Understanding**: Questions may require understanding the context within which something is mentioned in the file, which can be challenging to infer programmatically.\n\n13. **Performance Issues**: For large files, parsing efficiency becomes important.
