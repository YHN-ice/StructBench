        "To extract all bold texts from the given Markdown file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the Markdown file line by line.\n2. For each line, check if it contains any bold text. In Markdown, bold text is indicated by double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__).\n3. If bold text is found, extract it and add it to a list.\n4. After processing all lines, join the extracted bold texts with \\n and print the result.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef extract_bold_texts(file_path):\n    bold_texts = []\n\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as ***\n        ***\n            ***\n            ***'\\*\\*(.*?)\\*\\*', line))\n            bold_texts.extend(re.findall(r'__(.*?)__', line))\n\n    return '\\n'.join(bold_texts)\n\nfile_path = 'path/to/your/file.md'  # Replace with the actual file path\nprint(extract_bold_texts(file_path))\n```\n\nThis code uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of bold text in each line. The `findall` function returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, as a list of strings. The `extend` method is used to add these matches to the `bold_texts` list. Finally, the extracted bold texts are joined with \\n and printed.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the file is encoded in UTF-8. If the file is encoded in a different encoding, you should specify that encoding in the `open` function."
