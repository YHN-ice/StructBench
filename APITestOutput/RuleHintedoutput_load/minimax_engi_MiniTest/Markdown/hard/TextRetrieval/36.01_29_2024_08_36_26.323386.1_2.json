The parser needs to decide which part of the Markdown content is relevant to the question being asked.\n\n4. **Dealing with Incomplete or Inaccurate Information**: The Markdown file might not contain all the necessary information to answer the question, or it might contain outdated or incorrect information.\n\n5. **Formatting Differences**: Different Markdown processors might handle the syntax slightly differently, leading to potential inconsistencies in how content is rendered or understood.\n\n6. **Nested Structures**: Markdown allows for nested structures like lists within lists or blockquotes within list items, which can complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Parsing code blocks or inline code can be challenging because the parser must differentiate between Markdown syntax and code syntax.\n\n8. **Links and References**: The parser must be able to resolve link references and possibly retrieve additional information if the links are relevant to the question.\n\n9. **Extracting Structured Data**: If the question requires structured data extraction (like tables), the parser must be able to interpret and convert Markdown tables into a usable format.\n\n10. **Performance and Scalability**: If the file is very large or if there are many files to parse, performance and scalability might become issues.\n\n11. **Maintaining Context**: Some questions might require understanding the context in which something appears in the document, which might not be immediately adjacent to the keywords from the query.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust Markdown parsing approach would be needed. This might include regular expressions for pattern matching, a tree or stack-based approach for keeping track of nested structures, and perhaps some natural language processing for understanding ambiguous questions and maintaining context."
