        "To extract all bold texts from the given Markdown file and print them separated by a newline, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the input file line by line.\n2. For each line, check if it contains any bold text. In Markdown, bold text is denoted by double asterisks (`**`) before and after the text.\n3. If bold text is found, extract it and add it to a list or array.\n4. After processing all lines, join the extracted bold texts with a newline character (`\\n`) and print the result.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef extract_bold_texts(file_path):\n    bold_texts = []\n\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as ***\n        ***\n            ***\n            ***'\\*\\*(.*?)\\*\\*', line))\n\n    # Join the extracted bold texts with a newline and print the result\n    print('\\n'.join(bold_texts))\n\nextract_bold_texts('input.md')\n```\n\nThis code uses the `re` module in Python to find all occurrences of bold text in each line of the input file. The `findall` function returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, as a list of strings. The `*` character in the regular expression is a wildcard that matches any character (except a newline), and the `.` character matches any character (except a newline). The `?` character after the `.` makes the match non-greedy, so it will stop at the first closing `**` it encounters.\n\nPlease replace `'input.md'` with the path to your Markdown file."
