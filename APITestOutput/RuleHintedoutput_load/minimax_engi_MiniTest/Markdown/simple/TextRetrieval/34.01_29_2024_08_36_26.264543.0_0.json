For example, both asterisks and underscores can be used for italics and bold text. This variability can make parsing more complex.\n\n3. **Nested Content**: Markdown supports nested structures like lists within lists or blockquotes within blockquotes. Parsing such nested structures correctly is important when extracting information.\n\n4. **Links and References**: Markdown allows for both inline links and reference-style links. Keeping track of link definitions and correctly associating them with their corresponding textual references could be challenging.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Distinguishing between regular text and code can be crucial since code blocks can contain text that looks like markdown but should not be interpreted as such.\n\n6. **HTML in Markdown**: Sometimes markdown files contain inline HTML for content that can't easily be represented with standard markdown syntax. Parsing this correctly without mistaking it for regular markdown is important.\n\n7. **Metadata Blocks**: Some markdown files contain metadata at the beginning (like YAML front matter). This needs to be recognized and handled separately from the main content.\n\n8. **Incomplete or Incorrect Formatting**: If the markdown isn't properly formatted (e.g., missing closing tags, unmatched parentheses for links), it can throw off a parser trying to understand the structure.\n\n9. **Handling Images and Media**: Markdown supports embedding images, but parsing these correctly and understanding their relevance in the context of the question could be difficult.\n\n10. **Extensibility**: There are various flavors of Markdown with additional features (like tables, footnotes, etc.), so knowing which version or extensions are in use is important to parse correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust markdown parser needs to:\n\n- Have a comprehensive understanding of the markdown specification(s).\n- Be equipped with efficient algorithms to handle nested structures and ambiguities.\n- Employ error-handling mechanisms to deal gracefully with incomplete or incorrect formatting.\n- Be able to handle a variety of markdown flavors and extensions.\n- Extract and associate metadata, links, and references appropriately.\n- Distinguish between code and regular text, processing each correctly.\n\nOnce these challenges are addressed, the parser can extract and"
