        "To extract all bold texts from the given Markdown file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the Markdown file line by line.\n2.

If the line contains bold text, extract the text between the asterisks or underscores and add it to a list.\n4. After processing all lines, join the list of bold texts into a single string separated by \\n and print the result.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef extract_bold_texts(file_path):\n    bold_texts = []\n\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as ***\n        ***\n            ***\n            ** '**' in line or '__' in line:\n                # Extract the text between the asterisks or underscores\n                start = line.find('**')\n                end = line.find('**', start + 1)\n                if start != -1 and end != -1:\n                    bold_texts.append(line[start + 2:end])\n\n                start = line.find('__')\n                end = line.find('__', start + 1)\n                if start != -1 and end != -1:\n                    bold_texts.append(line[start + 2:end])\n\n    # Join the list of bold texts into a single string separated by \\n\n    result = '\\n'.join(bold_texts)\n\n    return result\n\nfile_path = 'path/to/your/file.md'  # Replace with the actual file path\nprint(extract_bold_texts(file_path))\n```\n\nThis code will print the following output:\n\n```\nkangaroo\nkangaroo\n```"
