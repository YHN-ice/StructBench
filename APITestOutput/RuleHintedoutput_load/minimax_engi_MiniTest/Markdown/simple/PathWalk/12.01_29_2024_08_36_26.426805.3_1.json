For example, `#` is used for headers, `*` or `-` for list items, backticks `` ` `` for code, etc. I would need to interpret these correctly to extract the intended information.\n\n2. **Complex Structures**: Markdown supports complex structures like nested lists, code blocks, and tables. These can be challenging to parse if the structure is deeply nested or not formatted consistently.\n\n3. **Inline Formatting**: Text could have inline formatting such as italic (`*text*` or `_text_`), bold (`**text**` or `__text__`), strikethrough (`~~text~~`), and links (`[text](URL)`). Determining which parts of the text are emphasized or are meant as hyperlinks could affect the understanding of the content.\n\n4. **Non-standard Extensions**: Different implementations of Markdown support various extensions to the basic syntax, such as footnotes, checkboxes, or definition lists. If the file uses these, they would require special handling.\n\n5. **Ambiguity in Questions**: Questions about a Markdown file may be ambiguous and require interpretation based on context. For instance, if a question is about a \"section,\" this could refer to a header and its following content, or to a specific part of a list or table.\n\n6. **Contextual Information**: Answers might not be explicit in the text and could rely on an understanding of context or implied information, which can be difficult to deduce programmatically.\n\n7. **Code and Quotes**: Markdown allows the inclusion of code blocks and quotes, which should be treated differently from normal text as they may contain examples rather than explanations or descriptive text.\n\n8. **Keeping Track of Hierarchy**: Headers usually define a hierarchy (e.g., `#` for H1, `##` for H2). It's important to keep track of this to understand the organization of content within the document.\n\n9. **Metadata**: Some Markdown files include metadata at the top (frontmatter) that is not meant to be displayed as part of the document but may contain relevant information for certain questions.\n\n10. **Escaping Characters**: Markdown allows for characters to be escaped so that they are displayed literally rather than treated as formatting.
