The parser must be able to navigate through the document's structure and extract information that's relevant to the question.\n\n3. **Handling Ambiguity**: Sometimes, the text in Markdown might be ambiguous, and without proper context, it may lead to incorrect interpretations. The parser should be able to handle this ambiguity.\n\n4. **Nested and Complex Structures**: Markdown files can have nested structures like lists within lists or multiple sections. Parsing these correctly and maintaining context is important.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Markdown supports code blocks and inline code which may contain text that looks like Markdown syntax but shouldn't be treated as such. The parser must distinguish between actual Markdown syntax and code.\n\n6. **Links and References**: Markdown allows for links that could be inline or reference-based. The parser should be able to resolve these correctly to determine if the link content is relevant.\n\n7. **Images and Other Media**: Like links, images have a special syntax in Markdown. While images don't typically convey information that's pertinent to a text-based question, the alt text might be relevant.\n\n8. **Metadata**: Some Markdown documents include metadata (like YAML front matter) which could contain relevant information that needs to be parsed separately.\n\n9. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: There are various flavors of Markdown (e.g., GitHub Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.) with slight differences in syntax and capabilities. The parser should ideally handle these variations.\n\n10. **Performance**: If the document is large, parsing efficiency and memory management could become a concern, especially for complex queries or multiple successive queries.\n\n11. **Textual Inference**: Some questions might require not just retrieval of information but also understanding and inferring information from the given text, which is a complex task for any parser.\n\n12. **Non-Textual Elements**: If the file contains non-textual elements (tables, mathematical equations), they need to be interpreted correctly depending on the question context.\n\nTo overcome these potential difficulties, the parser must have a robust understanding of the Markdown syntax and structure, employ context-aware strategies for extracting information, and manage different"
