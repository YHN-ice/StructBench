        "To answer the question \"What is the depth of node vh?\", we need to parse the given tree file and traverse it to find the depth of the node 'vh'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\n\n1.

For each line in the file, split the line by the delimiter (e.g., '->') and extract the parent and child nodes.\n\n3. Add the parent and child nodes to the data structure, maintaining the hierarchy.\n\n4. Once the tree is constructed, start traversing it from the root node (in this case, the root node is at depth 0).\n\n5. Keep track of the current depth as you traverse the tree.\n\n6.
