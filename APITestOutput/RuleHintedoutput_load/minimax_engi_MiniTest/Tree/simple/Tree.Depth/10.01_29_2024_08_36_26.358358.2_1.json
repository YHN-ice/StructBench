        "To answer the question \"What is the depth of node mc?\", we need to find the path from the root to the node 'mc'. \n\n1. First, we need to understand the file format. The file represents a tree structure where each line represents a parent-child relationship between two nodes. For example, 't->u' means that 't' is a parent of 'u'.\n\n2. Next, we need to parse the file and create a data structure that represents the tree. One way to do this is by using a dictionary or hash map where the keys are the nodes and the values are lists of their children.\n\n3. Once the tree is created, we can then traverse it to find the depth of the node 'mc'. We start from the root node (in this case, 't') and follow the path to 'mc'. We keep track of the depth as we traverse the tree.\n\n4. When we reach 'mc', we can return the depth as the answer.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that demonstrates this approach:\n\n```python\ntree = {}\n\nwith open('file.txt', 'r') as ***\n    ***\n        ***'->')\n        if parent not in tree:\n            tree[parent] = []\n        tree[parent].append(child)\n\ndef find_depth(node, parent=None, depth=0):\n    if node not in tree:\n        return -1  # Node not found\n    if node == 'mc':\n        return depth\n    for child in tree[node]:\n        if child != parent:\n            depth = find_depth(child, node, depth + 1)\n    return depth\n\nprint(find_depth('t'))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nThis code first reads the file and creates the tree structure. Then, it defines a recursive function `find_depth` to find the depth of a given node. The function takes the current node, its parent, and the current depth as arguments. It checks if the current node is 'mc' and returns the depth if it is. If not, it recursively calls itself for each child of the current node, incrementing the depth by 1 for each recursive call. If the node is not found in the tree, it returns -1. Finally, it calls `"
