Each node in the tree should have a reference to its parent and its children.\n\n2. Start from the root node (e in this case) and follow the path to the node 'dc'. Since the path is not explicitly given in the file, we need to traverse the tree to find the path.\n\n3. Traverse the tree using a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
