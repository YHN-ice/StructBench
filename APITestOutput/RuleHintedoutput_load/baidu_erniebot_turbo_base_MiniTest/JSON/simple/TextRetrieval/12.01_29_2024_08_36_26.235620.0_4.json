        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the JSON file in a text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).\n2. Use the text editor or IDE to highlight the section of the file that corresponds to the question.\n3. Copy the highlighted section of the file and paste it into your programming language's JSON parser or library (e.g., Python's json module).\n4. Parse the JSON data using the appropriate JSON parser or library (e.g., Python's json module).\n5. The parsed JSON data will be a dictionary object that contains nested objects and lists. You can access the desired nested object by using dot notation (e.g., \"subs.id\") or index notation (e.g., \"subs[0].id\") to traverse through the nested structure.\n\nIn this specific case, the desired nested object is \"subs\" and its value is an empty list ([]). To access this object, you can use dot notation like this:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nwith open('file.json', 'r') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Access nested object using dot notation\nnested_object = data['subs']\nprint(nested_object)  # Output: [{'id': 'u', 'Y': 'c', 'subs': []}]\n```\nIn this example, we used Python's json module to parse the JSON file and access the desired nested object using dot notation. The output will be a nested dictionary object that corresponds to the desired nested structure."
