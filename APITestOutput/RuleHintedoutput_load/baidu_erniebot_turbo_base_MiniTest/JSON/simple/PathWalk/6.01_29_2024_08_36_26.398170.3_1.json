        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Find the section of the file that corresponds to the question. In this case, it's the \"subs\" section.\n3. Inside the \"subs\" section, you will find a list of objects with ids. The first object's id is \"o\".\n\nIf you want to extract the ids of all objects in the \"subs\" section, you can use a loop to iterate through each object and print its id. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.json\") as file:\n    data = json.load(file)\n\nfor sub in data[\"subs\"]:\n    print(sub[\"id\"])\n```\nIn this example, \"file.json\" is the name of your file and \"subs\" is the section you want to extract ids from. You can replace these with your actual file name and section name.\n\nNote: This assumes that your file is in JSON format and you have a Python environment with json library installed. If your file is in a different format or you don't have Python installed, you may need to use a different programming language or library to parse the file."
