Find the section of the file that corresponds to the question. In this case, it's the \"subs\" section.\n3. Inside the \"subs\" section, you will find a list of objects with ids. The first object's id is \"d\".\n\nIf you want to extract this information programmatically, you can use a programming language like Python or JavaScript to parse the file and extract the information. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.json\") as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Access the first object in subs\nsub = data[\"subs\"][0]\nprint(sub[\"id\"])  # Output: d\n```\nThis code opens the file and converts it to a Python dictionary. It then accesses the first item in the \"subs\" list and prints out the \"id\" value. You can modify this code to suit your specific needs."
