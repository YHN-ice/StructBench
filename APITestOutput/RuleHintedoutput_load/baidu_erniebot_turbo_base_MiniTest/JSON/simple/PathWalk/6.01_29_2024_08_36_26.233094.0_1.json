Inside the JSON object, find the \"subs\" array.\n4. Inside the \"subs\" array, find the first object and its \"id\" property.\n\nIn this case, the first object's id is \"u\".\n\nIf you are asking how to extract this information programmatically, you can use a JSON parsing library such as Python's json module or a dedicated JSON library like PyYAML or jsonschema.
