Read the file line by line and parse it according to the JSON format.\n3. Check for any structural errors in the JSON structure using a JSON validator tool or library.\n4. If there are any errors, mark the corresponding line with a 'True' in the answer field.\n5. If there are no errors, mark the answer field with 'False'.\n\nIn this specific case, you can use a JSON validator tool like JSONLint or a JSON library like Python's json module to check for errors. You can also use a text editor like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code to highlight any syntax errors or invalid characters in the file.\n\nOnce you have checked for errors, you can replace the answer line with the correct answer based on the results of your validation.\n\nNote: This is a general explanation and assumes you have access to a text editor or IDE and JSON validator tools or libraries.
