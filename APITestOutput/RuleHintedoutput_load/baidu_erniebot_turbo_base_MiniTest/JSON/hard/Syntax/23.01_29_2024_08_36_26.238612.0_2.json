Use a JSON validator tool to verify if the file is a valid JSON document. Some JSON validator tools provide an output window to display errors or warnings if any structural issues exist in the document.\n3. Once you identify any errors or issues in the JSON structure, they can be found within the corresponding fields in the file.\n4. You can also use a JSON schema to define the expected structure of the JSON document and compare it with the actual structure of the file.
