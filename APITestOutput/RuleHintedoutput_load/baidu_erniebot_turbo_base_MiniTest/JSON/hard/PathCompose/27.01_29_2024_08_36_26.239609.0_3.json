To access this value, you can follow the provided answer and use the following syntax:\n\nobj[\"subs\"][1][\"M\"]\n\nThis will give you the value \"qy\" in the \"subs\" array of the first object in the \"subs\" array of \"id\" \"o\".\n\nHowever, it should be noted that this data structure is quite complex and it may be helpful to break it down into smaller pieces and access each piece separately to find the value you are looking for. For example, you may need to search for specific \"id\" values in different nested arrays before you find the value you are looking for.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have a recursive search algorithm or at least an efficient search mechanism that allows you to search for multiple \"id\" values efficiently within a nested structure like this."
