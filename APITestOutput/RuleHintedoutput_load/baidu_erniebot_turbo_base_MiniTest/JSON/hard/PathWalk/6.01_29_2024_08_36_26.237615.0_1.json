        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Find the section of the file that corresponds to the question. In this case, it's the \"subs\" section within the JSON object.\n3. Within the \"subs\" section, locate the object that has the same \"id\" as the question.\n4. Inside that object, you will find the first object's id. It is specified within the \"id\" key.\n\nFor example, if you want to know what \"id\" is \"h\", you would look for the object with \"id\" of \"h\" within the \"subs\" section of the JSON file. Once you find it, you will see the \"id\" value directly under that object.\n\nIn this case, it would be:\n\n\n```arduino\n\"id\": \"h\"\n```\nIn your specific question, you've stated that you want to know \"What is the first object's id of subs?\". This corresponds to the object with \"id\" of \"h\".\n\nNote: It's important to understand that this file format is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. It uses human-readable text format and is very easy to read and write using text editors and programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, etc. The \"id\" keys are just strings that represent unique identifiers for each object within the JSON structure."
