        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Locate the section of the file that contains the JSON data.\n3. Read the JSON data line by line, separating each line into its own object.\n4. Each object should be an associative array with key-value pairs.\n5. To get the \"deepest nested objects\", you can use a recursive function to traverse the JSON structure and find the maximum depth.\n\nHere's an example in Python code that can help you find the deepest nested objects:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_deepest_nested_objects(json_data):\n    deepest_depth = 0\n    deepest_object = None\n    for obj in json_data:\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            for key, value in obj.items():\n                if isinstance(value, (dict, list)):\n                    current_depth = len(key) + 1  # Add one for the key itself\n                    if current_depth > deepest_depth:\n                        deepest_depth = current_depth\n                        deepest_object = obj\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):\n            for item in obj:\n                if isinstance(item, (dict, list)):\n                    current_depth = len(item)  # Add one for each item in the list\n                    if current_depth > deepest_depth:\n                        deepest_depth = current_depth\n                        deepest_object = item\n    return deepest_object, deepest_depth\n\nwith open(\"your_file.json\") as f:\n    json_data = json.load(f)\n    deepest_object, deepest_depth = find_deepest_nested_objects(json_data)\n    print(f\"The deepest nested object is {deepest_object} with a depth of {deepest_depth}\")\n```\nIn this code, you can replace \"your_file.json\" with the actual path to your JSON file. The function `find_deepest_nested_objects` will traverse the JSON structure and find the deepest nested object with the maximum depth. The output will be the deepest object and its depth."
