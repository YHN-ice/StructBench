        "The answer to your question is to use a JSON parser or library to read and parse the file. A JSON parser is a program or library that can read and understand the syntax of JSON files. Once you have parsed the file, you can access the nested objects by using the keys and values that are provided in the answer.\n\nHere's how you can do it using Python's built-in json library:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nwith open('file.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Now you can access the nested objects using the keys provided in the answer\nprint(data['id'])  # This will print \"q\"\nprint(data['Z'])  # This will print \"e\"\nprint(data['subs'][0]['id'])  # This will print \"r\"\n```\nYou can replace 'file.json' with the actual path to your JSON file and replace 'id', 'Z', etc. with the actual keys in your file. You can also access nested objects using dot notation, such as `data['subs'][0]['subs'][0]['id']` to access the \"t\" object that is nested two levels deep.\n\nIf you don't have a JSON parser or library installed, you can use Python's built-in JSON module to install it:\n\n\n```shell\npip install simplejson\n```\nThis will install simplejson, which is a popular JSON library in Python. Then you can follow the above steps to parse and access the nested objects in your JSON file."
