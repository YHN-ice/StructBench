        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line: You can use a for loop or a specific programming language's read file function to read the file line by line.\n2. Extract the information you need: Based on the question, you need to extract the height information from the file. You can use a conditional statement or a loop to extract the height information based on the gender and age of each person.\n3. Count the taller people: After extracting the height information, you can count how many people are taller than 171.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Read the file line by line\nwith open('file_name.txt', 'r') as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\n# Step 2: Extract the height information\ntall_people = {}\nfor line in lines:\n    columns = line.strip().split('\\t')  # Use tab as separator\n    gender = columns[1]\n    age = columns[2]\n    height = int(columns[4])  # Assuming height is in integer format\n    if gender == 'male' and height > 171:\n        tall_people[age] = True  # Add the person to the dictionary if they are taller than 171\n    elif gender == 'female' and height > 171:\n        tall_people[age] = False  # Add the person to the dictionary if they are not taller than 171\n\n# Step 3: Count the taller people\ntall_count = len(tall_people)\nprint(tall_count)  # Prints the count of tall people\n```\nRemember to replace 'file_name.txt' with the actual name of your file. Running this code will print out the number of tall people based on the file contents."
