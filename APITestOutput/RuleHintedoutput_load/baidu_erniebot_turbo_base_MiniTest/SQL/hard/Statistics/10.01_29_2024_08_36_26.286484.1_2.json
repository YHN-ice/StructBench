This is usually done with a text editor or programming language like Python.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"your_file_path.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    data = file.readlines()\n\nfor row in data:\n    columns = row.strip().split(\"\\t\")  # Tab delimited data, using tabs as the delimiter\n    if columns[2] == \"female\":  # Check the gender column for \"female\"\n        print(columns[1])  # If female, print the corresponding person name\n```\nRemember to replace \"your_file_path.txt\" with your actual file path. This code assumes that the file is tab-delimited, which is common for tabular data. If your file uses a different delimiter, you'll need to adjust the split function accordingly.\n\nOutput:\n\n\n```\nc\ne\ng\ni\nl\n```\nThese are the names of the female people in the file."
