Locate the section of the file that contains the question (e.g., \"How many people are male?\").\n3. Use the text editor or spreadsheet program to scan through the file and locate the information that corresponds to the question.\n4. Count the number of occurrences of \"male\" or \"female\" (or both) that appear in the corresponding rows in the file.\n5. Write down the resulting number as the answer to the question.\n\nIn this specific case, the file contains two separate sections: one with information about gender and age of individuals, and another with information about employment status, salary, and company. Therefore, you will need to follow these steps for each section separately:\n\n* Gender and age section: Open the file in a text editor and scan through it to locate rows with \"male\" or \"female\" in the \"gender\" column. Count the number of occurrences of \"male\" and \"female\" and write down the resulting number as the answer to \"How many people are male?\".\n* Employment status, salary, and company section: Open the file in a text editor and scan through it to locate rows with \"employed\", \"unemployed\", \"retired\", or other statuses related to employment. Count the number of occurrences of each status and write down the resulting number(s) as the answer(s) to any questions related to employment status or salary.\n\nNote: Depending on the specific question, you may need to review different sections of the file or apply additional filters to narrow down your search."
