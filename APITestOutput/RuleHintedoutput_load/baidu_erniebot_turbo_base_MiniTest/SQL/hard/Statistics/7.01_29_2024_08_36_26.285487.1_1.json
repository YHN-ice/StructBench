        "The answer you are looking for is on the second line of the file you provided, and it says that \"how many people work with salary more than 358275?\" There are 8 people who have a salary greater than 358275.\n\nTo extract this information from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or spreadsheet program (such as Microsoft Excel).\n2. Scroll down to the second line (the answer to the question you provided).\n3. Look for the line that says \"how many people work with salary more than 358275?\" and count the number of rows that follow it.\n4. If there are 8 rows or more following the question line, then you have found the answer to your question.\n\nIf you are using a programming language, you can also use a scripting language (such as Python) to parse the file and extract the information you need. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file_path\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n    for line in lines:\n        if \"how many people work with salary more than 358275?\" in line:\n            answer = len(lines[line-1:])  # count the number of rows following the question line\n            print(\"The answer is\", answer)\n```\nIn this example, replace \"file_path\" with the actual path to your file. The script will open the file, read it line by line, and print the answer if it finds the question line."
