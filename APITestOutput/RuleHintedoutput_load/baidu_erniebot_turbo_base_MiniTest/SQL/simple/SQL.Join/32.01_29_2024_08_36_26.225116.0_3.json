        "The answer you are looking for can be obtained by using a program to read the provided file and then executing a SQL query. Here's an example:\n\nStep 1: Create a text file (named `script.sql`) and paste the following SQL query into it:\n\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE height > 159;\n```\nNote: Replace `table` with the actual name of the table in the file.\n\nStep 2: Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your file is located.\n\nStep 3: Execute the SQL query by typing `sqlite3 file.db < script.sql` (replace `file.db` with the actual name of your database file). This will load the SQL script into your SQLite database and execute the query.\n\nStep 4: Look at the output of the query in your SQLite console or file to determine how many people are taller than 159.\n\nThis method assumes that your database file is stored locally on your computer and uses SQLite as the underlying database engine. If you're using a different database system, please adjust the appropriate steps accordingly."
