Open the file in a text editor or a program that can read CSV files (such as Excel).\n2. Look for the rows that have \"salary\" values greater than 922576. This can be done by scrolling through the file or using a search function if available.\n3. Once you find the row(s) with the desired salary, you can extract the information related to \"name\" to get the names of the people with salary greater than 922576.\n4. Save the extracted information or output it to a text file or report for further processing or analysis.\n\nOnce you have the names of the people with salary greater than 922576, you can use these names to further investigate or perform additional tasks based on your specific requirements.\n\nNote: The provided file contains information about employees and job status, so it may not be suitable for all use cases.
