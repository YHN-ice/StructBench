        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or spreadsheet program (e.g., Microsoft Excel).\n2. Locate the column with the \"gender\" information. It should be labeled \"gender\" or similar in the file.\n3. Count the number of female entries in this column. You can do this by manually counting or using a formula in the spreadsheet program.\n4. Copy the count of female entries and paste it into the answer field.\n\nIn this specific case, the file contains two columns of information: \"gender\" and \"primeKey\". The \"gender\" column indicates whether a person is male or female. By counting the number of entries with female as the gender and excluding male entries, you can get the count of female people in the file.\n\nNote: It's recommended to check if there are any duplicate entries in the \"primeKey\" column or any errors in the file before relying on this method to avoid counting duplicates or missing information."
