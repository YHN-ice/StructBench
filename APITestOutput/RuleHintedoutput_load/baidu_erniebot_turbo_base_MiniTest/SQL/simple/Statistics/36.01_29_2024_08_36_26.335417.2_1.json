        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or program that can read the file format.\n2. Look for the question in the file and locate the corresponding answer.\n3. If the answer is provided in a specific column or row, you can simply extract it from the file.\n4. If the answer is provided in a separate text file or line, you can either manually copy and paste it into your program or use a program to extract the text from the file.\n5. After you have the answer, you can use it to answer the question or perform any other necessary action.\n\nIn this case, the answer to the question \"How many people work with salary more than 230884?\" is provided in the \"salary\" column of the file. You can simply extract the values from that column and count how many people have a salary greater than 230884.\n\nOnce you have extracted the data, you can parse it into a list or array, and then use a loop or counting function to count how many people have a salary greater than 230884. For example, in Python you could use a for loop to iterate over each row in the file and check if the salary is greater than 230884:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\") as file:\n    data = file.readlines()\n\nsalary_count = 0\nfor row in data:\n    row_data = row.strip().split(\"\\t\")  # Assuming tab-separated data\n    salary = int(row_data[3])  # Assuming salary is in the fourth column\n    if salary > 230884:\n        salary_count += 1\n```\nAfter running this code, `salary_count` will contain the number of people with a salary greater than 230884."
