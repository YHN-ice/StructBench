Print those file names separated by \\n.\nAnswer: \nvg.gif\nwg.gif\nFile: \nm\nperish idiot yogurt groot essence kangaroo monkey groot\n# n\nqualify idiot yogurt groot essence kan![alt](vg.gif \"hover text\")garoo monkey groot\n## o\nravish idiot yogurt groot essenc**kangaroo**![alt](wg.gif \"hover text\")essence kangaroo monkey groot\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "To extract all included image files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. Check each line for a pattern indicating an image file. This pattern may vary depending on the file format and syntax, but typically it might look like `[alt](image_path.jpg)` or `![alt](image_path.png)`.\n3. If a line matches the pattern, extract the image file name and save it somewhere.\n4. Continue reading the file until it's completely processed.\n\nIn the given example, the pattern looks like `![alt](image_path.png)` and `[alt](vg.gif \"hover text\")`. You can use a regular expression to find these patterns and extract the image file names.\n\nHere's an example in Python using the `re` module:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open(\"file_path.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    # Find image file names using regular expression\n    image_names = re.findall(r\"\\[alt\\](.*\\.png)\", line)  # or use r\"![alt](.*\\.jpg)\" for jpg format\n    for name in image_names:\n        print(name)\n```\nMake sure to replace `\"file_path.txt\"` with the actual path to your file. This code will read the file line by line and extract all image file names, printing them on separate lines.\n\nRemember that the pattern used to extract image file names may vary depending on the actual format and syntax of your file. You may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly."
