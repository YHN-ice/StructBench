        "Question: Given as input is a QA pertaining to a file with special format and syntax, please explain how to get the answer from the file: \n\n\nInput: \nQuestion: \nExtract all included image files. Print those file names separated by \\n.\nAnswer: \nzi.jpeg\nFile: \nf\nvigor halo nob nob essence cafe nob ravish\n# g\nwa**qualify**ke halo nob nob essence cafe nob ravish\n## h\nX-ray halo nob no**ravish**b essence c![alt](zi.jpeg \"hover text\")afe nob ravish\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "To extract all included image file names from the given file and print them on a newline, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file using a text editor or programming language's file I/O library.\n2. Find the line(s) that contain the file names you are interested in. Typically, image files will be denoted by words like \"cafe\", \"nob\", \"ravish\", \"X-ray\" or \"halo\" followed by a file extension like \".jpeg\".\n3. Copy and paste the file names into a text file or program that can handle newline-separated values (CSV, Excel, etc.).\n4. If you are using a programming language, you can use string manipulation or regular expressions to extract the file names from the given file. For example, in Python, you can use the `re` module to extract matches from a string.\n\nFor example, if you want to extract all file names that start with \"nob\" and end with \".jpeg\", you can use the following Python code:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open(\"file.txt\") as f:\n    lines = f.readlines()\n\nimage_names = []\nfor line in lines:\n    match = re.search(r\"(nob.*?)\\.(jpeg)$\", line)\n    if match:\n        image_names.append(match.group(1))\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(image_names))\n```\nThis code reads the file line by line and searches for lines that match the given pattern (starting with \"nob\" followed by any characters until the end of the line, followed by \".jpeg\"). The `re.search()` function returns a match object if it finds a match, and you can use the `group()` method to extract the file name from the match object. Finally, the `print()` function prints the file names on a newline separated by \"\\n\".\n\nRemember to replace \"file.txt\" with the actual name of your input file. Also, you may need to adjust the regular expression pattern to match your specific file format and syntax."
