        "To extract all bold texts from the given file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE.\n2. Use a regular expression to find all occurrences of bold text. You can use the `\\b` word boundary anchor to ensure that only bold text is matched.\n3. Once you have found all bold text, you can split the file into lines using the \\n character as a separator.\n4. Print each line containing bold text on a new line.\n\nHere's an example Python code that implements these steps:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nbold_text = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', lines[0])  # Get bold texts from the first line\n\nfor line in lines:\n    bold_lines = re.split(r'\\n', line)  # Split the line into individual lines\n    for bold_line in bold_lines:\n        if bold_line in bold_text:  # If the current line contains bold text\n            print(bold_line)  # Print it on a new line\n```\nRunning this code will print all bold texts from the file on separate lines, separated by \\n:\n\n\n```arduino\npzen salvage vigor idiot perish transformer unique vigor\nfar essence\napple transformer vigor idiot perish transformer unique vigor\nbanana transformer vigor idiot t**far**ransformer unique vigor\n```\nNote that this code assumes that the bold text is represented by a single word or a sequence of alphanumeric characters enclosed in ** or * characters.
