        "To extract all included image files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Open the file with a text editor or programming language (such as Python).\n2. Search for lines that contain words like \"img\", \"image\", \"jpeg\", \"jpg\", \"png\", \"gif\", or \".jpg\" (case-sensitive). These are usually the filenames of image files.\n3. Copy and paste the filenames into a new text file or print them using a programming language.\n\nIn this specific case, the file contains many lines of text with special formatting and syntax, so it may be difficult to simply search for specific keywords. However, you can still use the same general approach to extract the image filenames from the text file.\n\nPlease note that if you're trying to extract image filenames from a webpage or a larger text document, it might be easier to use a program that specifically handles HTML or markdown formatting, such as Python's beautifulsoup or requests libraries.\n\nFinally, please keep in mind that not all image files will be visible in the text document you're working with. Some images may be embedded in HTML or CSS code, or they may be compressed and not visible in a regular text editor."
