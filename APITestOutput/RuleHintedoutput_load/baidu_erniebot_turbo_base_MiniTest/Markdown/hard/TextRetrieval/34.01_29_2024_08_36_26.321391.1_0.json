Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like VS Code.\n2. Navigate to the line containing the bold text. In the file provided, you can use Ctrl+F or Command+F to search for bold text (likely a term such as \"bold\", \"**bold**\", or \"***bold***\").\n3. Copy the bold text and paste it into a new text file or clipboard.\n4. Repeat this process for all bold text in the file.\n5. Once you have copied all bold text, you can paste it into a new text file and separate each line with \\n using your preferred text editor or IDE.\n\nIn this case, the bold text would be:\n\n* perish\n* salvage\n* transformer\n* vigor\n* qualify\n* nob\n* oops\n* ravish\n* unique\n\nNote: The bold text in the provided file may not be formatted consistently, so it may be difficult to identify certain bold terms.
