        "To extract all bold texts from the given file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Look for the bold text in the file using a text editor or IDE.\n3. Copy the bold text into a new text file or variable.\n4. Print the bold texts separated by \\n using the new text file or variable.\n\nFor example, if you want to print the bold texts from the given file using Python, you can use the following code:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    bold_texts = [line for line in file if \"<b>\" in line or \"<u>\" in line]\n    for bold_text in bold_texts:\n        print(bold_text)\n```\nIn this code, \"file.txt\" is the name of the file with special format and syntax. The code uses a for loop to iterate over each line of the file and checks if any bold text or underlined text is found in the line. If it finds any, it adds it to a list called \"bold_texts\". Finally, it prints each bold text separately using \\n as a separator.\n\nNote: The bold text in the given file is represented using HTML tags `<b>` and `<u>` or image tags `<img>` with alt attributes. If you want to extract bold text from a different format or syntax, you may need to modify the code accordingly."
