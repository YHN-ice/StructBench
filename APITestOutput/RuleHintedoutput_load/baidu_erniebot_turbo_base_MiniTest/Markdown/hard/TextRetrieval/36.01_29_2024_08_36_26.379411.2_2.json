        "To extract all included image files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Find the section of the file that contains the images. This might be in a specific format or syntax, such as an image gallery or a list of images in a text file.\n3. Look for patterns in the file that indicate the presence of image files. These patterns might include specific keywords or file extensions.\n4. Once you find the images, extract their file names and save them to a new file or print them to the console.\n\nIn this specific case, the file contains a list of image files separated by multiple lines of text, so you can simply search for specific keywords or file extensions and print them to the console. For example, you can use a command-line tool like grep or find to search for jpg, jpeg, gif, and png files and print their names to the console using a command like this:\n\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"jpg\\|jpeg\\|gif\\|png\" filename.txt\n```\nThis command will search for any file names that contain the keywords \"jpg\", \"jpeg\", \"gif\", or \"png\" and print them to the console. You can replace \"filename.txt\" with the actual name of the file containing the images.\n\nIf you prefer a more user-friendly interface, you can use a programming language like Python to read the file and extract the image file names using a loop or a regular expression. Then you can save or print them as desired."
