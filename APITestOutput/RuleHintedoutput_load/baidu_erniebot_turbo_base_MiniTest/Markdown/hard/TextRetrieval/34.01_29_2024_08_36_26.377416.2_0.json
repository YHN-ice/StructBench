        "To extract all bold texts from the given file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Use a search/replace function to replace all bold text markers with spaces or some other delimiter (in this case, \\n).\n3. Once you have a clean file, read it line by line using a programming language like Python or Java.\n4. For each line, split the line using the delimiter (here, \\n).\n5. Then, extract all bold text and print it on a new line.\n\nIn Python, it would look like this:\n\n\n```python\nwith open('your_file_path') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        bold_text = line.replace('\\n', '').replace('**', '').replace('\\\\*', '').split(' ')\n        for bold_word in bold_text:\n            print(bold_word)\n```\nIn this code, we are using a regular expression to replace bold text markers with spaces. Then, we split the line into words using spaces as a delimiter. Finally, we print each bold word on a new line.\n\nRemember to replace `'your_file_path'` with the actual path to your file.\n\nThis assumes that your file follows the given format and syntax. If your file has different formatting or markers for bold text, you may need to adjust the search/replace steps accordingly."
