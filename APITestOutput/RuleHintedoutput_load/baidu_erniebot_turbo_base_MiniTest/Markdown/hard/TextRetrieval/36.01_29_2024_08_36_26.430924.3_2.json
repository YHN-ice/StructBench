        "To get the answer from the file, you can use a text editor or programming language to read and parse the file. The file contains a list of text and images, separated by newlines (\\n).\n\nTo extract all included image file names, you can use a regular expression to match the image file names and extract them from the text. Here's an example using Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    text = file.read()\n\nimage_pattern = re.compile(r'(\\.(png|jpeg|gif))')\nimage_names = image_pattern.findall(text)\n\nfor name in image_names:\n    print(name)\n```\nIn this example, the regular expression matches image file names that end with .png, .jpeg, or .gif. The `findall` method is used to find all matching image file names in the text, and the output is printed using `print(name)` to separate each image name with a newline character (\\n).\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the file format and syntax are consistent and that the file contains only text and images separated by newlines. If the file format or syntax is different, you may need to adjust the regular expression or parsing method accordingly."
