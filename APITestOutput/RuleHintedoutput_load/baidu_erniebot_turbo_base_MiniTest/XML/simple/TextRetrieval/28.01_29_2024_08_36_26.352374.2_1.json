        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Find the section of the file that contains the question text. In this case, it is \"What is the tag with attribute of value zy?\".\n3. Scroll through the file and locate the tag with attribute \"zy\". It should be nested within a larger XML structure.\n4. Once you find the tag, you can extract its value by using the appropriate XML parser or library to access its attributes.\n\nIn this case, the tag with attribute \"zy\" is <BB>. You can access its value by using a method such as `getAttribute()` or `getValue()` from the XML parser library you are using.\n\nAfter you have extracted the value, you can use it to answer the question. In this case, the value is \"banana banana\".\n\nRemember that XML files can be complex and contain nested tags and attributes, so it may require some time and effort to locate and extract the desired information."
