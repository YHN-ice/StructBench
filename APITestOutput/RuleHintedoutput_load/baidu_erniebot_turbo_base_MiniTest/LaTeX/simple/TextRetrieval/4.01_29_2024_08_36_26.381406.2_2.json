        "Question: Given as input is a QA pertaining to a file with special format and syntax, please explain how to get the answer from the file: \n\n\nInput: \nQuestion: \nExtract all included figure files. Print those file names separated by \\n.\nAnswer: \nie.jpeg\nFile: \nr\nravish yogurt qualify bana\\textbf{dentist}na monkey l\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{ie.jpeg}amb idiot cafe\n\\section{s}\nsalvage yogurt qualify banana monkey lamb idiot cafe\n\\subsection{t}\ntransformer yogurt qualify banana monkey lamb idiot cafe\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "To extract the included figure files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. Look for the `\\includegraphics` command or similar syntax that indicates the inclusion of a figure file.\n3. When you find such a command, extract the file name from the rest of the text after it.\n4. Separate the file names using \\n (a newline character) and print them.\n\nHere's an example in Python using the `re` module to extract the file names:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\npattern = r'\\\\includegraphics\\[.*?\\]'  # match \\includegraphics and anything after it\nfile_names = re.findall(pattern, lines)  # find all matches\n\nfor name in file_names:\n    print(name)\n```\nIn this example, the `\\includegraphics` command is matched and everything after it is captured as the file name. The `findall` method is used to find all matches in the text and returns a list of file names. The `print` statement then prints each file name on a new line.\n\nRemember to replace `'file.txt'` with the actual filename of your input file. Also, you may need to adjust the regular expression pattern depending on the specific format and syntax of your input file."
