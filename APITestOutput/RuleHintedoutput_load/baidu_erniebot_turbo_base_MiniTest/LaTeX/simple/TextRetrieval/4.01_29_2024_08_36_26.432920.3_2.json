        "To extract the file names from the special format and syntax file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a programming language's built-in file reading function (e.g., Python's `open()` function).\n2. Inside the loop, identify lines that contain `\\includegraphics` and check if they contain file names (usually filenames start with an uppercase letter and are followed by an extension like `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.).\n3. For each line that contains a file name, append it to a list.\n4. Once you've read the entire file, you can print the list of file names, separated by newlines.\n\nHere's a Python example code snippet to illustrate:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file_name_example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    file_contents = file.readlines()\n\nfile_names = []\nfor line in file_contents:\n    if \"includegraphics\" in line:\n        # Check if the line contains a file name\n        if \"(\" in line and \")\" in line:\n            filename = line.split(\"(\")[1].split(\")\")[0]\n            file_names.append(filename)\n\n# Print the file names\nfor name in file_names:\n    print(name)\n```\nIn this example, the code reads the file line by line and checks if each line contains `\\includegraphics`. If it does, it extracts the filename from the line and appends it to a list. Once the entire file has been read, the list of file names is printed out.\n\nNote that this assumes the format and syntax of the input file is similar to the provided example, which uses `\\includegraphics` to include images in a LaTeX-like format. Depending on the actual format of the input file, you may need to modify the code accordingly to handle different file formats or syntax."
