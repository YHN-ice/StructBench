        "To extract all bold texts from the given file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. For each line, check if it contains bold text using a regular expression or a text processing library.\n3. If the line contains bold text, extract the raw text and print it using \\n as a separator.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    bold_text = re.findall(r'<b>(.+?)</b>', line)  # use a regular expression to find bold text\n    if bold_text:\n        print('\\n'.join(bold_text))  # print the bold texts separated by \\n\n```\nIn this example, we used a regular expression to find all tags `<b>` and `</b>` that enclose bold text. Then, we checked if the line contains bold text and, if it does, we printed the raw text separated by \\n using the `join` method.\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the file follows a specific format and syntax with bold text enclosed in `<b>` and `</b>` tags. If your file follows a different format or syntax, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly."
