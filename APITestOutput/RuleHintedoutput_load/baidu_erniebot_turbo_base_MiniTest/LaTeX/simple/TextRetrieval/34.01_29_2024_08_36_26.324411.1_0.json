        "Question: Given as input is a QA pertaining to a file with special format and syntax, please explain how to get the answer from the file: \n\n\nInput: \nQuestion: \nExtract all bold texts. Print those raw texts separated by \\n.\nAnswer: \ntransformer\nunique\nsalvage\nFile: \nl\napple idiot nob far groot yogurt \\textbf{salvage}yogurt X-ray\n\\section{m}\nbanana idiot n\\textbf{transformer}ob far groot yogurt yogurt X-ray\n\\subsection{n}\ncafe idiot nob far groot yogurt y\\textbf{unique}\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{yd.jpeg}root yogurt yogurt X-ray\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Find the line that contains the question and answer. In this case, the question is \"Extract all bold texts. Print those raw texts separated by \\n.\" and the answer is \"transformer, unique, salvage\".\n3. Copy the answer into your code or script.\n4. Use the file's syntax to extract bold texts from the file. In this case, you can use a regular expression to find all occurrences of \"\\textbf\" followed by any text and capture the text between the two occurrences of \"\\textbf\".\n5. Print the extracted bold texts using a loop or other method to iterate through each line of the file and print each line's bold text.\n\nHere's an example code in Python that extracts bold texts from the file and prints them:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    bold_text = re.findall(r\"\\textbf(.*?)\\b\", line)\n    for bold_text_item in bold_text:\n        print(bold_text_item)\n        print(\"\\n\")\n```\nIn this code, \"file.txt\" is the name of the file you're reading from and \"r\" indicates that you're opening the file in read-only mode. \"re.findall()\" is a regular expression function that finds all occurrences of the pattern and captures the text between the occurrences of \"\\textbf\". The loop iterates through each line of the file and prints each line's bold text followed by a newline character (\\n).\n\nThis code assumes that the file contains only one question and answer per line, but if there are multiple questions or answers on a single line, you may need to modify the code accordingly."
