Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\nAnswer: \nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]\nFile: \nid: \"e\"\nZ: j,\nsubs: \n- id: \"f\"\n  Y: i,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"g\"\n    X: h,\n    subs: []\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "To access the value \"i\" from the given file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Find the line with the ID \"e\" and the value \"j\".\n3. Follow the answer provided in the question, which is obj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"].\n4. Since the \"subs\" array contains a nested array, you need to iterate through each item in the \"subs\" array.\n5. Inside the \"subs\" array, find the item with ID \"f\" and the value \"i\".\n6. Inside that item, you will find the value \"Y\" which you want to access.\n7. Now you can retrieve the value \"i\" from the variable \"Y\".\n\nThe code to retrieve the value \"i\" would be similar to the following:\n\n\n```python\nfile_contents = \"\" # Your file contents, this should be loaded into a variable\nobj = json.loads(file_contents) # Parse the file contents into a dictionary\n\n# Access the nested object\nsubs = obj[\"subs\"]\nfor sub in subs:\n    if sub[\"id\"] == \"f\" and sub[\"Y\"] == \"i\":\n        print(sub[\"Y\"])  # Access the value \"i\"\n```\nMake sure to replace `file_contents` with your actual file contents and adjust the code as needed for your specific use case."
