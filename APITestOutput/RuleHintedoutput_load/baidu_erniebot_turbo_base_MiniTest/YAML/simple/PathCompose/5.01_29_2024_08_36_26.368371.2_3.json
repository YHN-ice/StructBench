Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\nAnswer: \nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]\nFile: \nid: \"f\"\nZ: n,\nsubs: \n- id: \"g\"\n  Y: m,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"h\"\n    X: l,\n    subs: []\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n",
        "To get the value \"m\" from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file using a text editor or programming language such as Python.\n2. Look for the line with the ID \"f\" and its \"subs\" list. You should find something like \"subs: [...]\" or similar.\n3. Inside the \"subs\" list, locate the line with the ID \"g\" and its \"subs\" list.\n4. Inside the \"subs\" list of ID \"g\", find the line with the ID \"h\" and its \"X\" value, which should be \"l\".\n5. Finally, you can access the value \"m\" by using the path obj[\"g\"][\"h\"][\"Y\"] (where obj is your object you are accessing).\n\nTherefore, you should modify your answer accordingly to read:\n\nobj[\"f\"][\"g\"][\"h\"][\"Y\"]\n\nNote: The path obj[\"g\"][\"h\"][\"Y\"] is case-sensitive, so make sure to follow the same case as in the file.\n\nThis is assuming that your file is properly formatted and that you are accessing it correctly. If you are still having trouble, please provide more information about your specific situation and I will do my best to assist you further."
