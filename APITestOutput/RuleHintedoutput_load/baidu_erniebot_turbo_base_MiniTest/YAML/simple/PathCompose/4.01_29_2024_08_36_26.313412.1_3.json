Use the \"id\" value to locate the correct section of the file.\n3. In the \"subs\" section, use the \"id\" values to navigate to the desired value \"j\".\n\nBased on the provided answer, you can access \"j\" by using the following code:\n\n\n```python\nobj = json.loads(file_content)  # Assuming file_content is the content of the file in JSON format\nvalue = obj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]  # Accessing \"j\" from the file\n```\nHere, `file_content` should be the content of the file in JSON format.
