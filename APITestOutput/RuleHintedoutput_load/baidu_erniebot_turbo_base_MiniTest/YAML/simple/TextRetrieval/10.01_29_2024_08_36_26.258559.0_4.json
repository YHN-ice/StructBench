        "The answer to the question can be found in the provided YAML file. It contains a deeply nested object with no values of type list or dict. The structure of the object is as follows:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"g\"\nX: h\nsubs: []\n\n- id: \"e\"\n  Z: j\n  subs: \n    - id: \"f\"\n      Y: i\n      subs: \n        - id: \"g\"\n          X: h\n          subs: []\n```\nTo extract the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the YAML file in a text editor or IDE.\n2. Look for the section that matches the question's description, i.e., \"What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?\"\n3. Copy and paste the relevant section into a new text file or clipboard.\n4. You can now use any text processing tool to extract information from the copied section, such as counting the number of nested objects or analyzing their structure.\n\nNote that the provided YAML file is formatted with multiple lines, separated by \\n\\n, which makes it easier to read and parse. You can remove these line breaks if needed."
