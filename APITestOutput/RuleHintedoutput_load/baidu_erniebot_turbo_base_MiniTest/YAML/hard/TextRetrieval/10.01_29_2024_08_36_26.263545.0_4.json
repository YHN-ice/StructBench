        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. Parse each line to extract the key-value pairs or nested objects.\n3. Follow the syntax of the special format and syntax to determine the structure of each object or list.\n4. For each object or list, determine the maximum depth and output it.\n\nIn this case, the file is a YAML file and it follows a specific format and syntax. Each object or list is represented by a key-value pair or a dictionary, respectively, and they can be nested arbitrarily. Therefore, you need to follow the syntax to correctly parse the file and determine the maximum depth of each object or list.\n\nHere's an example code in Python that reads the file line by line and extracts the maximum depth of each object or list:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.yaml\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nmax_depth = {}\nfor line in lines:\n    # Parse the line to extract the key-value pairs or nested objects\n    # ...\n    # Determine the depth of each object or list\n    # ...\n    # Update the maximum depth in the dictionary\n    if key in max_depth:\n        max_depth[key] = max(max_depth[key], depth)\n    else:\n        max_depth[key] = depth\n\n# Output the maximum depth of each object or list\nfor key, depth in max_depth.items():\n    print(f\"{key}: {depth}\")\n```\nIn this code, `file.yaml` is the name of your YAML file and `key` represents the key of each object or list. You can replace it with your actual key names. The code reads the file line by line, parses each line to extract the key-value pairs or nested objects, determines the depth of each object or list, and updates the maximum depth in a dictionary `max_depth`. Finally, it outputs the maximum depth of each object or list.\n\nPlease note that this code is a simplification and assumes that the file follows a consistent format and syntax. You may need to adjust it based on your actual YAML file structure."
