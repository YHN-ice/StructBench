        "To get the answer from the YAML file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file into a string variable or in a file object.\n2. Use a YAML parser to parse the file into an object structure.\n3. You can use a debugger or print statements to examine the structure of the object to determine the object with id \"c\".\n\nFor example, you can use Python's `PyYAML` library to parse the YAML file and access the object with id \"c\":\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n\n# Access the object with id \"c\"\nobject_with_id_c = data['subs'][0]['subs'][0]\nprint(object_with_id_c)\n```\nThis code will open the YAML file and parse it into a Python dictionary. Then, it will access the first level of nested dictionaries (i.e., `data['subs']`) and access the second level of nested dictionaries (i.e., `object_with_id_c`) to get the object with id \"c\".\n\nNote that this assumes that your YAML file is valid and that it follows the provided format and syntax. If your YAML file is not valid or has errors, you may need to correct or clean it before parsing it."
