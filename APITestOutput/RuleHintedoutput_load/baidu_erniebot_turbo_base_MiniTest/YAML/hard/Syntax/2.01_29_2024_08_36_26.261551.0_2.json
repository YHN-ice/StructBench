This is invalid YAML syntax and should be removed.\n* The first line of the file does not start with a valid key name (id). YAML files typically start with a key name followed by a colon and a value. In this case, it seems to be an improper combination of key-value pairs.\n* The \":\" character in some key names should be used as an indent to differentiate levels within YAML documents. In this case, some key names use \":\" but they do not provide any indentation.
