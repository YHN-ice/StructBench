        "To access the value \"ry\" from the given file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, read the file line by line.\n2. Then, use the id of each object to access its sub-objects and their keys/values.\n3. Finally, follow the specified keys to access the value \"ry\".\n\nHere's an example code in Python to do this:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    data = file.readlines()\n\nobj = {}\nfor line in data:\n    key, value = line.split(\": \")\n    obj[key] = value.split(\", \")\n\nprint(obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][1][\"subs\"][0][\"P\"])  # Output: ry\n```\nIn this code, we first read the file line by line and split each line into key and value using \":\" as a separator. Then, we create a dictionary `obj` with the key-value pairs from the file. Finally, we access the value \"ry\" by following the specified keys.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the file is in the correct format and that each object has the same structure. If these assumptions are not met, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."
