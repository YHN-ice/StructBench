        "To access the value \"i\" from the given file, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).\n2. Find the section that corresponds to the \"id: \"i\"\" line in the file.\n3. Inside this section, find the \"subs:\" section.\n4. Inside this \"subs:\" section, you will find a list of sub-objects with ids.\n5. Iterate through each sub-object in the list and access its properties based on the provided answer (obj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]).\n6. In this case, it will be obj[\"i\"][\"subs\"][0].\n7. You can now access the value you are looking for based on the property names given in the answer (i.e., \"id\", \"N\", \"M\" for example).\n\nBased on the provided answer, the value \"i\" is inside the first sub-object with id \"j\". To access its properties, you can use obj[\"i\"][\"subs\"][0][\"id\"], obj[\"i\"][\"subs\"][0][\"N\"], and obj[\"i\"][\"subs\"][0][\"M\"].\n\nIn this case, the answer provided is not enough to access the value \"i\" directly, but it provides a hint on how to navigate through the object structure to find it.
