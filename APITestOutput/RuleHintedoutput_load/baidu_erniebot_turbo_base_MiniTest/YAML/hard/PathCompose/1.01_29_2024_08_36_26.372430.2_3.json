        "To access the value \"g\" from the given file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by reading the file line by line.\n2. Extract the \"id\" values from each line to identify the object you want to access.\n3. Then, using the \"id\" values, access the \"subs\" list and iterate through it to find the desired value \"g\".\n\nHere's an example code in Python that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    data = file.readlines()\n\n# Extract id values\nids = [line.split(\":\")[1].strip() for line in data if \"id\" in line]\n\n# Iterate through ids and access desired value\nfor id_value in ids:\n    sub_ids = data[data.index(f\"{id_value}:{next(data).split(':')[1]}\") + 2:]  # Start from second item after \"id\"\n    for sub_id in sub_ids:\n        if \"g\" in sub_id:  # Access value \"g\"\n            print(sub_id[\"g\"])\n```\nIn this code, we first read the file line by line and extract the \"id\" values from each line. Then, we iterate through the list of \"id\" values and access the desired value \"g\" from each object's \"subs\" list.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the file format and syntax are consistent and that the desired value is always within the \"subs\" list of each object. If your file format or syntax is different, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."
