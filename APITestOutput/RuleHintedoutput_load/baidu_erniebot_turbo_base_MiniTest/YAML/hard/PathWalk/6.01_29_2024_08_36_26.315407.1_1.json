        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. Parse the file using a parser or regular expression to extract the information you are interested in.\n3. In this case, you are asking for the \"id\" of the first object in the \"subs\" list. You can find it by scanning through the file and look for the line that contains \"subs:\" and then follow the list of objects to find the first one with \"id:\" that matches your query.\n\nIf you are using a programming language like Python, you can use a loop to iterate through the file and check each line for a match. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        if \"subs:\" in line:\n            # Extract the first object with \"id:\"\n            obj = next(line for line in file if \"id:\" in line)\n            print(obj)\n```\nThis code will open the file and iterate through each line, checking for the line that contains \"subs:\" and then printing the first line that contains \"id:\" in it. This should give you the desired answer of \"t\".\n\nRemember to replace \"file.txt\" with the actual path to your file. If your file is in a different directory or has a different name, you will need to adjust the path accordingly."
