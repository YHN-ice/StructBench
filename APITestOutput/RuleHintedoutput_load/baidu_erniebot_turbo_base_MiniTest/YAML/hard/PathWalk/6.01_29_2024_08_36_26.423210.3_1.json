Navigate to the section of the file that contains the question.\n3. Read the content of the file and look for the object with the id you are asking about.\n4. Once you find the object, you can look at its attributes to get the answer to the question.\n\nIn this case, the question is asking about the id of the first object in the `subs` section of the file. Since the first object's id is \"b\", you can find it in the provided file and answer is \"b\".\n\nIt is worth noting that there is no need to use a special syntax or a special tool to read and parse the file since it is a plain text file. You can use any text editor or IDE to open and view it."
