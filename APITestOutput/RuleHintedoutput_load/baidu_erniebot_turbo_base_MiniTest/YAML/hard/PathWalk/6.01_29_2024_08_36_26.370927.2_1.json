        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the file in a text editor or IDE.\n2. Locate the section that matches the question (in this case, the first object's id of subs).\n3. In the file, you will see the following output:\n\n\n```plaintext\n- id: \"p\"\n  Y: i,\n  X: h,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"q\"\n    W: g,\n    V: f,\n    subs: \n    - id: \"r\"\n      U: e,\n      subs: []\n    - id: \"s\"\n      T: d,\n      subs: []\n```\n4. The answer is \"p\". You can confirm this by scrolling down to the answer section and checking if it matches the expected answer.\n\nNote that the file format and syntax used in this example is not clear from the provided input. However, it appears to be formatted in a tabular format where each object has a series of properties or attributes. In this case, the \"id\" of each object appears to be used as a unique identifier within the list of sub-objects.\n\nTo get answers from other sections or objects in the file, you can follow similar steps by locating the relevant section and parsing the data accordingly."
