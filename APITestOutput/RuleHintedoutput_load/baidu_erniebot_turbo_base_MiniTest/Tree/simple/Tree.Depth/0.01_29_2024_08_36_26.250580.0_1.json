        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. For each line, parse it to extract the information you need.\n3. In this case, you are looking for the depth of node tb. You can parse the file to find the path to tb and then calculate its depth based on the provided information.\n\nHere's an example code in Python that reads the file and extracts the depth of node tb:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\ndepth = 0\ntb_path = \"\"\nfor line in lines:\n    if \"f->\" in line:\n        tb_path = line.split(\"->\")[1]\n    elif \"q->\" in line and tb_path == \"tb\":\n        depth = int(line.split(\"->\")[1])\n        break\n\nprint(\"Depth of node tb:\", depth)\n```\nIn this code, we read the file line by line and parse it to find the path to tb and its depth. We check for lines that contain \"f->\" or \"q->\" and update the tb_path variable accordingly. Once we find a line with \"q->tb\", we extract its depth and break the loop. Finally, we print the depth of node tb.\n\nMake sure to replace \"file.txt\" with the actual name of your file and adjust the code according to your specific requirements."
