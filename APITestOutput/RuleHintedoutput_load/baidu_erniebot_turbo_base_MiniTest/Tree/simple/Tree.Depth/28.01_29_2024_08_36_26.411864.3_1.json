        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line: Use a programming language's built-in function to read the file line by line.\n2. Parse the file content: Once you have read the file, parse its content to extract the information you need. In this case, you are looking for the depth of node \"wc\". You can use a regular expression or a parsing algorithm to extract this information from the file.\n3. Extract the depth of node wc: After parsing the file, you will find the depth of node \"wc\" in the file content. You can store this information in a variable or use it further in your program.\n\nIn this specific case, the file contains a directed graph where each node is represented by a line with its name and its successors. The depth of each node is given by its position in the file.\n\nHere's an example in Python that reads and parses the file:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\n# Parse the file content\ndepth = 0  # Start depth for wc\nfor line in lines:\n    if line.startswith(\"h->\"):\n        depth += 1\n    elif line.startswith(\"i->\"):\n        depth += 1\n    # Continue parsing for other nodes...\n```\nThis code assumes that each line starts with \"h->\", \"i->\", etc., indicating the start of a new node and its depth. You can modify it to handle other cases as needed.\n\nAfter parsing the file, you will have the depth of node \"wc\" in variable `depth`. You can use it further in your program or compare it with other nodes in the graph."
