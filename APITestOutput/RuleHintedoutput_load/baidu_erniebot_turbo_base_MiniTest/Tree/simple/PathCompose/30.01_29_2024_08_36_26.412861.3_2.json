        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. For each line, parse it to extract the information related to the path from root node to node n.\n3. You can use a data structure like a graph or a tree to represent the path.\n4. Start from the root node and follow the edges in the file to reach node n.\n5. Repeat the above steps until you reach node n.\n6. Store the path as an ordered sequence of nodes (starting from the root node and ending at node n).\n\nFor example, in this file, the path from root node h to node n is j->m->n, because in file there is a sequence of edges h->i->j->m->n. You can get this information by following these steps.\n\nRemember that the order of edges in the file determines the order of traversal in the path. Therefore, make sure to read and parse the file in the correct order to get the correct answer."
