        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. Parse each line to extract the information related to nodes and edges.\n3. Calculate the height of the root node by following the longest path from the root to any leaf node.\n\nHere's an example code in Python that reads the file and calculates the height of the root node:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\") as file:\n    nodes = {}  # Store nodes and their edges\n    for line in file:\n        node, neighbor = line.strip().split(\"->\")\n        nodes[node] = neighbor\n\n    root_node = list(nodes.keys())[0]  # Get the root node\n    leaf_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not nodes[node]]  # Get leaf nodes\n    root_height = len(leaf_nodes)  # Calculate the height of the root node\n\nprint(\"Root node height:\", root_height)\n```\nIn this code, we read the file line by line and store the nodes and their edges in a dictionary. Then, we get the root node and its leaf nodes by iterating over the nodes dictionary. Finally, we calculate the height of the root node by counting the number of edges in the longest path from the root to any leaf node.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that there is exactly one root node and that there are no cycles in the graph. If these assumptions do not hold, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."
