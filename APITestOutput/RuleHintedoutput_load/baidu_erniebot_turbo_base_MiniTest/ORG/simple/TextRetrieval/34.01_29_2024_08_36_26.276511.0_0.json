        "To extract all bold texts from the file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. For each line, check if it contains bold text using a regular expression or a string method. You can use the special characters \\*\\* or X-ray* to represent bold text.\n3. If a line contains bold text, extract the raw text and print it using \\n as a separator.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    if \"**\" in line or \"X-ray*\" in line:\n        bold_text = line.strip()\n        print(bold_text.replace(\"*\", \"\\n\"))\n```\nIn this example, the file \"file.txt\" is read using the `open()` function and stored in the `lines` list. Then, for each line in the list, it checks if the line contains bold text using regular expressions or string methods. If a line contains bold text, it extracts the raw text and replaces the * characters with \\n to separate each bold text. Finally, it prints the extracted bold texts using \\n as a separator.\n\nRemember to replace \"file.txt\" with the actual file name you're working with. You can also modify the regular expressions or string methods to suit your specific requirements."
