        "To extract all bold texts from the given file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. For each line, check if it contains bold text using a regular expression or a text processing library.\n3. If bold text is found, extract the raw text and print it using \\n as a separator.\n\nHere's an example in Python using the re module:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    bold_text = re.findall(r\"<b>(.*?)</b>\", line)  # use your favorite regular expression\n    if bold_text:\n        print(\"\\n\".join(bold_text))  # print the bold texts separated by \\n\n```\nThis code assumes that bold text is enclosed in `<b>` and `</b>` tags. You can modify the regular expression according to the format and syntax of your file.\n\nMake sure to replace \"file.txt\" with the actual filename of your file. Running the code will output all bold texts from the file, separated by \\n. If no bold texts are found, the output will be \"No bold texts presented in file.\" as stated in the input question."
