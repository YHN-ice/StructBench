        "To extract all included image files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. Check if each line contains a file name. This can be done by checking if the line starts with a dot (.) or contains certain special characters such as slashes (/), exclamation marks (!), or quotation marks (\").\n3. If a line contains a file name, extract the file name and append it to a list or string variable.\n4. Once you have processed all lines, you can print the list or string variable with each file name separated by \\n.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file_path\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nimage_files = []\nfor line in lines:\n    if line.startswith(\".\") or \" \" in line or \"*\" in line or \"(\" in line or \")\" in line:\n        continue  # Skip this line if it's not a valid file name\n    else:\n        image_files.append(line.strip())  # Append the file name to the list\n\nfor file_name in image_files:\n    print(file_name)\n```\nMake sure to replace \"file_path\" with the actual path of the file you want to process. The code above assumes that each line starts with a dot or contains certain special characters that are considered invalid file names. Adjust the logic if necessary based on your specific requirements."
