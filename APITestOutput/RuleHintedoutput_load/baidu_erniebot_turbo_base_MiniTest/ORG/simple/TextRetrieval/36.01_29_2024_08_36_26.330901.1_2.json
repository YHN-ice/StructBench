        "To extract all included image file names from the given file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. Look for the occurrences of the string \"[[image_filename]]\". This will indicate the start of an image file name.\n3. Extract the file name from the line and save it to a list or variable.\n4. After processing all lines, print the file names separated by a newline character.\n\nHere's an example code in Python that implements these steps:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nimage_files = []\nfor line in lines:\n    if \"[[image_filename]]\" in line:\n        start = line.find(\"[[image_filename]])\") + len(\"[[image_filename]]\")\n        end = line.find(\"]\", start)\n        file_name = line[start:end]\n        image_files.append(file_name)\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(image_files))\n```\nThis code assumes that the file contains the given format and syntax, and extracts all image file names from the file. It reads the file line by line, searches for the occurrence of \"[[image_filename]]\", extracts the file name, and saves it to a list. Finally, it prints the file names separated by a newline character.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the file format and syntax are consistent throughout the entire file. If there are any variations or irregularities, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."
