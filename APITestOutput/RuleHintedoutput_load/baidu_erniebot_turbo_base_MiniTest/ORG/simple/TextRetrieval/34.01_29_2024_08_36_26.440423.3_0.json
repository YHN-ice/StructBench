        "To extract all bold texts from the given file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a programming language like Python or Java.\n2. For each line, check if it contains bold text using a regular expression or some other text processing method.\n3. If a line contains bold text, extract it and print it using \\n as a separator.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    bold_text = re.findall(r'\\*\\w*\\*', line)  # Use a regular expression to find bold text\n    if bold_text:\n        print('\\n'.join(bold_text))  # Print the bold texts separated by \\n\n```\nIn this example, we're using the Python regular expression module `re` to find all instances of `\\*\\w*\\*` in each line of the file. This pattern matches sequences of characters surrounded by two asterisks, indicating bold text.\n\nIf you're using a different programming language, you can use similar methods to find bold text and print it using a separator."
