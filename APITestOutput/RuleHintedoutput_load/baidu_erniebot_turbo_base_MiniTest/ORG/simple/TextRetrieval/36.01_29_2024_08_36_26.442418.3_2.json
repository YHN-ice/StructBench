        "To extract all included image files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. Look for patterns indicating image files. These patterns may include specific file extensions (e.g., .png, .jpg), file names containing certain keywords, or specific formatting or syntax.\n3. For each line that contains an image file, extract the file name and store it in a list or variable.\n4. Once you have processed all lines, print the file names separated by \\n.\n\nHere's an example in Python using the `re` module to extract image file names from the given file:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nimage_files = []\n\nfor line in lines:\n    # Look for patterns indicating image files\n    if re.search(r'\\.(png|jpg)$', line):\n        image_files.append(line.strip())\n\n# Print the file names separated by \\n\nfor file in image_files:\n    print(file)\n```\nThis code assumes that the file contains lines with image files that end with .png or .jpg extensions. It extracts the file names from each line and prints them separated by \\n. You can modify the regular expression pattern to match other patterns for your specific file format and syntax."
