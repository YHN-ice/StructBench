        "To extract all included image files from the special format and syntax file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. Look for special characters or patterns that indicate image files. For example, if the file contains \"\\.\" or \"*.jpeg\" or \"*.png\", those are likely to indicate image files.\n3. For each line that contains an image file, extract the file name and save it in a list or variable.\n4. Separate the file names by \\n and print them.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file_path_here\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nimage_files = []\nfor line in lines:\n    if \"*.jpeg\" in line or \"*.png\" in line:\n        file_name = line.split(\"\\\\\")[1]  # assuming \"\\n\" is used as line separator\n        image_files.append(file_name)\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(image_files))\n```\nReplace \"file_path_here\" with the actual path of the file you want to process. This code assumes that the file uses \"\\n\" as line separator and that the image files are indicated by \"*.jpeg\" or \"*.png\" patterns. You may need to adjust these assumptions based on your specific file format and syntax."
