        "To extract all included image files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. Check if the line contains a file name or an image file name.\n3. If it is a file name or an image file name, extract it and print it using \\n as a separator.\n\nIn this specific case, the file contains images embedded in the text using a special format and syntax. You can use a programming language like Python to parse the file and extract the image file names. Here's an example using Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    # Check if the line contains a file name or an image file name\n    if \"(\" in line and \")\" in line:  # Special syntax to identify image file names\n        # Extract the image file name from the line\n        image_name = line.split(\"(\")[1].split(\")\")[0]\n        print(image_name)\n```\nThis code will read the file line by line and check if the line contains a special syntax to identify image file names. If it does, it will extract the image file name and print it separated by \\n.\n\nNote: The syntax used in the given file is not standard, so it may vary depending on the specific format used for embedding images. It's important to be aware of the specific format used in the given file before extracting image file names."
