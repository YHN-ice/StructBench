        "To extract all included image files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. For each line, check if it contains a special format and syntax indicating an image file.\n3. If it does, extract the file name and print it.\n\nHere's an example code in Python that can achieve this:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file_path\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    if \"[[\" in line and \"]]\" in line:  # Check if line contains an image file\n        file_name = line.split(\"]]\")[0].split(\"[[\")[1].strip()  # Extract the file name\n        print(file_name)\n```\nReplace \"file_path\" with the actual path of the file you want to extract images from. The code will read the file line by line, check if each line contains a special format indicating an image file, and extract the file name if it does. The extracted file names will be printed out one by one, separated by \\n.\n\nRemember to adapt the code to your specific requirements and adjust the path accordingly if necessary."
