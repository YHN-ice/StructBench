        "To extract all bold texts from the given file and print them separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. Check if each line contains a bold text. You can use a regular expression to identify bold text based on the asterisks (*) used to indicate bold formatting.\n3. If a line contains bold text, extract the raw text and print it using \\n as a separator.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    bold_text = re.findall(r'\\*\\w+\\*', line)  # Regular expression to find bold text\n    if bold_text:\n        print(''.join(line.strip().split('\\n')[:-1]) + '\\n' + ''.join(bold_text))\n```\nThis code will read the file line by line and split each line using \\n as a separator. It then extracts bold text using a regular expression and prints it along with the original text. The code assumes that bold text is represented by double asterisks (*) in the file and is separated by normal text using single asterisks (*). If your file uses different formatting or separators, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly."
