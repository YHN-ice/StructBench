        "To extract all included image files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. For each line, check if it contains a special format for image files (e.g., file extensions like .png, .gif, .jpeg, etc.).\n3. If it does, extract the file name and print it using \\n as a separator.\n\nHere's an example code in Python that implements this process:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    # Check if line contains image file extension\n    if any(image_ext in line for image_ext in [\"png\", \"gif\", \"jpeg\", \"jpg\"]):\n        # Extract file name and print it\n        print(line.strip().split(\"\\\\n\")[0])\n```\nThis code assumes that the file format follows the given format and syntax. It reads the file line by line and checks if each line contains one or more image file extensions. If it does, it extracts the file name using split(\"\\\\n\") and prints it using print(line.strip()).\n\nRemember to replace \"file.txt\" with the actual filename of your input file."
