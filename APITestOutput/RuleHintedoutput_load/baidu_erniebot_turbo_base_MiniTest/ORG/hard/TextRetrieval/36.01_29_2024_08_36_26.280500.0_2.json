        "To extract all included image files from the given file and print their file names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. For each line, check if it contains a special format and syntax indicating an image file.\n3. If it does, extract the file name and print it.\n\nIn this case, the file format and syntax is using asterisks (*) to mark image file names. The syntax can be easily identified by using a regular expression to check for occurrences of asterisks within the line.\n\nHere's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open('file_path_here', 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        # Use a regular expression to find occurrences of asterisks\n        pattern = re.compile(r'\\*')\n        matches = pattern.findall(line)\n        \n        # Check if any matches were found\n        if matches:\n            # Extract the file name from the line\n            file_name = matches[0]\n            print(file_name)\n```\nReplace `'file_path_here'` with the actual file path that you want to process. The code will iterate over each line in the file and check for occurrences of asterisks using a regular expression. If a match is found, it will extract the file name and print it on its own line.\n\nThis should help you extract all included image file names from the given file and print them separated by \\n."
