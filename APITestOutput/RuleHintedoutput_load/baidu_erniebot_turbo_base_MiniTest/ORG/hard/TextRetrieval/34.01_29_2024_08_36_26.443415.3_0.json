        "To extract all bold texts from the given file and print them as raw texts separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line using a text editor or programming language.\n2. Look for any text that is surrounded by special characters such as * or **. These are the bold text markers.\n3. Once you find bold text, remove the surrounding markers and replace them with a new line character (\\n).\n4. Print the resulting text as it is, without any further processing or formatting.\n\nIn this specific case, the bold text markers are * and **. You can use a regular expression to find and replace these markers with \\n. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    text = file.read()\n\nbold_text = re.sub(r'\\*|\\*\\*', '\\n', text)\nprint(bold_text)\n```\nThis code will read the file \"file.txt\" and replace all instances of * or ** with a new line character (\\n). The resulting text will be printed to the console.\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the bold text is surrounded by valid bold text markers, and that there are no other formatting or special characters in the text that need to be preserved. If your file contains additional formatting or special characters, you may need to adjust the regular expression accordingly."
