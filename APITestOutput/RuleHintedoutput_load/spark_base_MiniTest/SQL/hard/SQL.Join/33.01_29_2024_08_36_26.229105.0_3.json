        "To get the answer from the file, you can use a programming language like Python to read the file and parse the data. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nfilename = \"your_file.txt\"\n\nwith open(filename, 'r') as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\n# Find the line with the question\nquestion_line = None\nfor i, line in enumerate(lines):\n    if \"How many people who work in IL are taller than 175?\" in line:\n        question_line = i\n        break\n\nif question_line is not None:\n    # Find the line with the answer\n    answer_line = lines[question_line + 1]\n    answer = int(answer_line.split(',')[-1].strip())\n    print(\"Answer:\", answer)\nelse:\n    print(\"Question not found in the file\")\n```\n\nReplace \"your_file.txt\" with the name of your file containing the data. This code will read the file, find the line containing the question, and then extract the answer from the next line. Finally, it will print the answer.To get the answer from the file, we can use Python to read the file and extract the required information. Here's a code snippet to do that:\n\n```python\nfilename = 'input_file.txt'\n\n# Read the file and store its contents in a list of lines\nwith open(filename, 'r') as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\n# Find the line containing the answer\nanswer_line = None\nfor i, line in enumerate(lines):\n    if 'CA' in line:\n        answer_line = i + 1\n        break\n\n# Extract the answer from the answer line\nif answer_line is not None:\n    answer = lines[answer_line].split('\n')[2].strip()\n    print(f\"Answer: {answer}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found in the file.\")\n```\n\nReplace `'input_file.txt'` with the path to your input file. This code will read the file, find the line containing the answer, and print it out.To get the answer from the file, you can use Python to read the file and extract the desired information. Here's a sample code to do that:\n\n```python\ndef get_answer(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        lines = file.readlines()\n\n    count = 0\n    for line in lines[1:]:\n        data = line.split('\\t')\n        if data[5] == 'HI' and int(data[6]) > 167:\n            count += 1\n\n    return count\n\nfile_path = 'path/to/your/file.txt'\nanswer = get_answer(file_path)\nprint(f\"Answer: {answer}\")\n```\n\nReplace `'path/to/your/file.txt'` with the actual path to your file. This code will read the file, iterate through each line (skipping the header), split the line by tab, and check if the height is greater than 167. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count as the answer."
