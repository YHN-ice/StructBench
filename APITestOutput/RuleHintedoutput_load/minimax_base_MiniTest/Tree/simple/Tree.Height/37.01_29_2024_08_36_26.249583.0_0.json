        "To get the answer from the file, we need to find the height of the root node, which is the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.\n\n1. First, we need to identify the root node. In this case, the root node is 'e'.\n2. Next, we need to find the leaf nodes. Leaf nodes are nodes that do not have any children. In this case, the leaf nodes are 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'ab', 'bb', 'cb', 'db', 'eb', 'fb', 'gb', 'hb', 'ib', 'jb', 'kb', 'lb', 'mb', 'nb', 'ob', 'pb', 'qb', 'rb', 'sb', 'tb', 'ub', 'vb', 'wb', 'xb', 'yb', 'zb', 'ac', 'bc', 'cc', 'dc', 'ec', 'fc', 'gc', 'hc', 'ic', 'jc', 'kc', 'lc', 'mc', 'nc', 'oc', 'pc', 'rc', 'sc', 'tc', 'uc', 'vc', 'wc', 'xc', 'yc', 'zc', 'ad', 'bd', 'cd', 'dd', 'ed', 'fd', 'gd', 'hd', 'id', 'jd', 'kd'.\n3.
