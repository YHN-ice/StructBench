First, we need to identify the root node. In this case, the root node is 'h'.\n2. Next, we need to find the leaf nodes. Leaf nodes are nodes that do not have any children. In this case, the leaf nodes are 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'z', 'ab', 'bb', 'cb', 'eb', 'fb', 'gb', 'hb', 'ib', 'kb', 'lb', 'mb', 'nb', 'ob', 'pb', 'qb', 'rb', 'sb', 'tb', 'ub', 'vb', 'wb', 'xb', 'yb', 'zb', 'ac', 'bc', 'cc', 'dc', 'fc', 'gc', 'hc', 'ic', 'kc', 'lc', 'mc', 'nc', 'oc', 'pc', 'qc', 'rc', 'sc', 'uc', 'vc', 'wc', 'xc', 'yc', 'zc', 'ad', 'bd', 'cd', 'dd', 'ed', 'fd', 'gd', 'hd', 'id', 'jd', 'kd', 'ld', 'md', 'nd'.\n3. Now, we need to find the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. In this case, the longest path is from 'h' to 'zc' (or any other leaf node).\n4.
