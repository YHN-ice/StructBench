In this case, we are looking for the first object's id under the \"subs\" key.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. Parse the YAML file using a YAML parser. In Python, you can use the PyYAML library.\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('file.yaml', 'r') as ***\n    ***\n```\n\n2. Navigate through the parsed data to find the \"subs\" key.\n\n```python\nsubs = data['subs']\n```\n\n3. Since we want the first object's id, we can simply access the first item in the \"subs\" list.\n\n```python\nfirst_object_id = subs[0]['id']\n```\n\n4. Print the first object's id.\n\n```python\nprint(first_object_id)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print:\n\n```\nb\n```\n\nSo, the first object's id of subs is \"b\"."
