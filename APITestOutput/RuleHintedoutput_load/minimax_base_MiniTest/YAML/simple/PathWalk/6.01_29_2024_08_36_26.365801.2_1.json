Parse the YAML ***\n\n*** 'subs' list: Once the file is parsed, you need to navigate to the 'subs' list. In this case, it's located under the 'subs' key.\n\n3. Access the first object in the 'subs' list: The first object in the 'subs' list is the first element of the list. You can access it using its index (0 in most programming languages).\n\n4. Get the 'id' of the first object: Once you have the first object, you can access its 'id' by using the 'id' key.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\n# Parse the YAML file\nwith open('file.yaml', 'r') as ***\n    ***\n\n*** 'subs' list\nsubs = data['subs']\n\n# Access the first object in the 'subs' list\nfirst_sub = subs[0]\n\n# Get the 'id' of the first object\nfirst_sub_id = first_sub['id']\n\nprint(first_sub_id)  # Output: g\n```\n\nIn this example, the first object's id of the 'subs' list is 'g'."
