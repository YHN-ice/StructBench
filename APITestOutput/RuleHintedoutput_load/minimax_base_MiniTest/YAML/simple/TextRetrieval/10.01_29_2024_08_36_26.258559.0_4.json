        "To find the most deeply nested objects in the YAML file, we need to traverse the file and keep track of the depth of each object. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `max_depth` to 0. This variable will keep track of the maximum depth of the objects.\n2. Initialize a variable `current_depth` to 0. This variable will keep track of the current depth of the objects.\n3. Iterate through the YAML file, line by line.\n4. For each line, check if it is a dictionary or a list. If it is, increase `current_depth` by 1.\n5. If the line is a dictionary or a list, check if it is the deepest object so far. If it is, update `max_depth` with `current_depth`.\n6. If the line is not a dictionary or a list, decrease `current_depth` by 1.\n7.
