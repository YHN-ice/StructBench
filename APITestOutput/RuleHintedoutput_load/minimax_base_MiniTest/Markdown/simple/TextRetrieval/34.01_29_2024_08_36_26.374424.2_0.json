The `.*?` is a non-greedy match that will capture the text between the double asterisks. The `re.findall` function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the file content. Finally, the `'\\n'.join(bold_texts)` is used to join the extracted texts into a single string, with each text separated by a newline character."
