Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. Start at the root of the JSON file, which is the object with id \"c\".\n2. Check if the object with id \"e\" is directly under the root object. In this case, it's not, so move on to the next step.\n3. Look for the \"subs\" array under the root object. This array contains other objects.\n4. Iterate through the objects in the \"subs\" array. In this case, there's only one object with id \"d\".\n5. Check if the object with id \"e\" is directly under the object with id \"d\". Again, it's not, so move on to the next step.\n6.
