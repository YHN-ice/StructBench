Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. Start at the root of the JSON file.\n2. Look for the \"subs\" array under the root object.\n3. Iterate through the elements in the \"subs\" array.\n4. For each element, check if it has a \"subs\" array. If it does, repeat steps 3 and 4 recursively.\n5. If the element has an \"id\" field with the value \"u\", you have found the object you are looking for.\n\nFollowing these steps, you will find the object with id \"u\":\n\n{\n\"id\":\"u\",\n\"V\":\"wy\",\n\"U\":\"vy\",\n\"subs\":[]\n}"
