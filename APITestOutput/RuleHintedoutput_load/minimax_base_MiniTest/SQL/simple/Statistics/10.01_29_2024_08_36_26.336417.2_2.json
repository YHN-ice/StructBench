        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the file line by line.\n2. For each line, check if the line starts with \"primeKey\". If it does, skip this line as it is a header.\n3. If the line does not start with \"primeKey\", split the line by the delimiter (in this case, it seems to be a tab).\n4. Check if the second element in the split line is \"female\". If it is, increment a counter.\n5. After reading all the lines, the counter will have the number of females in the file.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that implements these steps:\n\n```python\nfile_path = \"path_to_your_file.txt\"\n\nwith open(file_path, \"r\") as ***\n    ***\n\n***\n\n***\n    ***\"primeKey\"):\n        continue\n    parts = line.split(\"\\t\")\n    if parts[1] == \"female\":\n        female_count += 1\n\nprint(f\"There are {female_count} females in the file.\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code with the given file, it will print \"There are 4 females in the file.\""
