        "To get the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, you need to identify the relevant column for the question. In this case, the question is asking about the number of females, so the relevant column is 'gender'.\n\n2. Next, you need to count the number of occurrences of the value 'female' in the 'gender' column.\n\n3. You can do this by using a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, or by using a programming language like Python.\n\n4. If you are using a spreadsheet program, you can use the COUNTIF function to count the number of occurrences of 'female' in the 'gender' column.\n\n5. If you are using Python, you can use the pandas library to read the file and then use the value_counts() function to count the number of occurrences of 'female' in the 'gender' column.\n\n6. Once you have the count, you can provide the answer as the number of females. In this case, the answer is 8."
