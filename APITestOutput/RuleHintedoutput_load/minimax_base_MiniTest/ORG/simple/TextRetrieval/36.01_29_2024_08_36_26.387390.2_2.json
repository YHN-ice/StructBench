        "To extract all included image files and print their names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the input file line by line.\n2. For each line, check if it contains a pattern that indicates an image file is included. In this case, the pattern is \"[[\".\n3. If the line contains the pattern, extract the filename between the \"[[\"] and \"]]\" characters.\n4. Add the extracted filename to a list.\n5. After reading all lines, print the filenames in the list separated by \\n.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements these steps:\n\n```python\nfile_names = []\n\nwith open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as ***\n    ***\n        ** \"[[[\" in line and \"]]]\" in line:\n            start = line.find(\"[[[\") + 3\n            end = line.find(\"]]]\")\n            file_name = line[start:end]\n            file_names.append(file_name)\n\nfor file_name in file_names:\n    print(file_name)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code with the given input file, it will output:\n\n```\nmg.jpeg\n```"
