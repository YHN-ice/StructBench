        "To extract all included image files and print their names separated by \\n, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the input file line by line.\n2. For each line, look for patterns that indicate an image file is included. In this case, the pattern is a word enclosed in double square brackets, like [[file.ext]].\n3. When you find a match, extract the file name from the pattern. The file name is the text between the square brackets.\n4. Add the extracted file name to a list or set to avoid duplicates.\n5. After reading all lines, print the list or set of file names, separated by \\n.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements these steps:\n\n```python\nfile_names = set()\n\nwith open('input.txt', 'r') as ***\n    ***\n        ***'\\[\\[([^]]+)\\]\\]', line)\n        for match in matches:\n            file_names.add(match)\n\nfor file_name in file_names:\n    print(file_name)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\npe.jpeg\nqe.png\nre.jpeg\n```"
