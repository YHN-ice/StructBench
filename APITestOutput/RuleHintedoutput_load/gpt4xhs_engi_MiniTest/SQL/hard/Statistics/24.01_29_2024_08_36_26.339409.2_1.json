        "To answer the question \"How many people work with salary more than 506551?\" using the provided file, you would need to parse the data and perform the following steps:\n\n1. Read the file and identify the structure: The file seems to be in a tabular format with two sections, separated by a blank line. Each section has its headers, indicating that the file likely represents two related tables. The first section has personal details, while the second has employment information, linked by the 'primeKey'.\n\n2. Merge the data based on the 'primeKey': Since the salary information is in the second table, you need to associate it with each person. You could create a combined data structure (like a dictionary) where each 'primeKey' corresponds to a complete record of both personal and employment details.\n\n3. Filter based on employment status and salary: You need to consider only those records where the 'status' is 'employed', as the question asks for people who work (are employed). After filtering for employment status, further filter those records to find individuals with a salary greater than 506551.\n\n4. Count the number of records that meet the criteria: After filtering, count how many entries have a salary greater than the specified amount. This count will be your answer.\n\nAssuming you have already parsed the data into an appropriate format and filtered it based on the steps above, your final step would be to simply count the number of entries that meet the criteria. Based on the given file:\n\n- Person with primeKey 'a' is unemployed, so they are not counted.\n- Person with primeKey 'b' is employed with a salary of 638351, which is more than 506551.\n- Person with primeKey 'd' is employed with a salary less than 506551, so they are not counted.\n- Person with primeKey 'h' is employed with a salary less than 506551, so they are not counted.\n- Person with primeKey 'i' is employed with a salary less than 506551, so they are not counted.\n- Person with primeKey 'j' is employed with a salary less than 506551, so they are not counted.\n\nFrom the given information in the file snippet, we can see only one employed person (primeKey 'b') with a salary above 506551. However, since your answer is \"3\", it implies that there are two more entries in the full file that meet these criteria"
