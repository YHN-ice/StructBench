This often requires automated tools or scripts to handle efficiently.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: The file might use a specific character encoding that, if not handled correctly, could lead to incorrect interpretation of the data.\n\n6. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: If there are missing fields or incomplete entries, it can complicate the process of drawing accurate conclusions.\n\n7. **Data Anomalies**: Outliers or anomalies within the data could lead to incorrect assumptions or answers if not properly accounted for.\n\n8. **Versioning of Data**: If the file represents a version of data that may have changed over time, understanding the context in terms of time and changes is important.\n\n9. **Embedded Metadata or Instructions**: Sometimes files contain metadata or instructions embedded within them that can affect how the data should be read and interpreted.\n\n10. **Access to Documentation**: Lack of documentation or access to explanations about the file format can significantly hinder the process of interpreting data correctly.\n\nOverall, careful analysis of the input file and a detailed understanding of its format and contents will be necessary to overcome these potential obstacles."

Identify the structure of the table: The file contains two headers, each indicating the start of new columns.
