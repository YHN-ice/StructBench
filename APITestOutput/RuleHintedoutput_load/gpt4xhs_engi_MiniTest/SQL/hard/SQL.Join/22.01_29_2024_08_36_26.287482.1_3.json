        "The process to answer the question \"How many people who work in CA are taller than 167?\" from the given file involves parsing the data and applying filters based on the criteria specified in the question. Here are the steps to get the answer:\n\n1. Understand the Data Structure: Recognize that the file contains two tables. One table includes personal attributes with columns such as primeKey, gender, age, name, height, weight, and color. The second table includes employment-related attributes with columns such as primeKey, status, salary, company, and location.\n\n2. Associate Data Using PrimeKey: Since primeKey is used to identify the same person across both tables, you need to match the primeKey from the personal attributes table with the primeKey from the employment-related table to combine relevant information about each person.\n\n3. Filter by Location: Identify records where the location is 'CA' (California) in the employment-related table.\n\n4. Filter by Height: Among the records filtered by location, further filter to identify records where the height is greater than 167.\n\n5. Count the Results: Count the number of records that meet both criteria (located in CA and taller than 167).\n\nFollowing these steps and looking at the data provided:\n\n- There are three people who work in CA: b (employed at NVIDIA), d (unemployed at Apple), and l (retired from Google).\n- Checking their heights by matching their primeKeys with the corresponding primeKey in the personal attributes table:\n  - b is 121 cm tall,\n  - d is 196 cm tall,\n  - l is 145 cm tall.\n- Only one person (d) meets both criteria of working in CA and being taller than 167 cm.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 1, as there is only one person who satisfies both conditions."
