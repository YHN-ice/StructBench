The file appears to be a flat-file database with two sections joined by a `primeKey`. The first section contains personal attributes (gender, age, name, height, weight, color), and the second section contains employment attributes (status, salary, company, location).\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: From the question, we need to consider the `height` (should be greater than 154) and the `location` (should be 'WA') columns.\n\n3. **Link the Data**: Use the `primeKey` to join personal attributes with employment attributes for each individual.\n\n4. **Filter by Criteria**: After joining the data, filter the records to find individuals who work in 'WA'.
