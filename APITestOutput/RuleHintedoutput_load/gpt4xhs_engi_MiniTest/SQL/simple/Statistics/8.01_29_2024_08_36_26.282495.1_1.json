        "The process to answer the question \"How many people work with salary more than 204201?\" from the provided file involves parsing the data and applying the condition to count the number of people who meet the criteria.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how to extract this information:\n\n1. **Understand the File Structure**: The file provided seems to be a plain text file with a tabular structure, where fields are separated by tabs (or spaces that align like tabs). The file has two sections, each with a header row that describes the columns below.\n\n2. **Parse the File**: Read the file line by line. The first section includes `primeKey`, `gender`, `age`, `name`, `height`, `weight`, `color`. The second section, separated by a blank line or a different set of headers, includes `primeKey`, `status`, `salary`, `company`, `location`.\n\n3. **Link Data Across Sections**: Since both sections share the `primeKey` column, it's used to link data about an individual's demographic info with their employment info.\n\n4. **Filter Based on Salary**: From the second section of the file, filter out individuals whose `salary` is greater than 204201. \n\n5. **Count the Qualified Individuals**: Count the number of individuals who meet the salary condition and also check that their `status` indicates they are employed (since the question asks about people who 'work', implying employment).\n\nGiven the sample data, here's a simple breakdown of how you would manually determine the answer:\n\n- b: `salary` = 312289 (meets condition, but is retired)\n- c: `salary` = 126875 (does not meet condition)\n- d: `salary` = 516418 (meets condition and employed)\n- e: `salary` = 981032 (meets condition and employed)\n- f: `salary` = 643057 (meets condition, but is retired)\n- g: `salary` = 763295 (meets condition, but is unemployed)\n\nOnly individuals d and e are both employed and earn a salary greater than 204201.
