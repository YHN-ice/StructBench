File Format and Structure: Understanding the structure of the file is crucial. If it's a custom or unfamiliar format, it may take time to understand how the data is organized and how to navigate it.\n\n2. Syntax and Semantics: The syntax rules of the file must be clear to correctly interpret the information.

Data Consistency: If the data is not consistent or there are errors in the file, extracting accurate information can be challenging.\n\n4. Complexity of Queries: The complexity of the questions asked will affect how difficult it is to extract information. Simple queries might require straightforward lookups, while more complex ones may need intricate parsing logic.\n\n5. Primary Key Identification: In tables where rows with the same primary key refer to the same person, it's important to correctly identify and associate these rows to compile a complete record for each individual.\n\n6.
