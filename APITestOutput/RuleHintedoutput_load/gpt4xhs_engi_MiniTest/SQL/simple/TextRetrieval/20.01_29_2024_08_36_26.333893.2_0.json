        "To extract the answer from the file, we'll need to follow a step-by-step process that addresses some of the potential difficulties outlined. Here's how you could approach this task:\n\n1. **Understand the File Structure**: The file appears to have a tabular data format with rows and columns. There are two distinct sections separated by an empty line: the first section contains columns for `primeKey`, `gender`, `age`, `name`, `height`, `weight`, and `color`; the second section includes `primeKey`, `status`, `salary`, `company`, and `location`.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Section**: Since the question asks for the \"location\" of a record with a specific `primeKey`, we need to look in the second section, where the `location` column exists.\n\n3. **Locate the Correct Row**: Search for the row where the value in the `primeKey` column matches 'g'.\n\n4. **Extract the Answer**: Once the correct row is found, read the value in the `location` column of that row.\n\nGiven the data in the file provided, here's how to find the answer manually:\n\n```\nprimeKey\tstatus\tsalary\tcompany\tlocation\n...\ng\temployed\t632481\tMicrosoft\tIL\n```\n\nThe record with the `primeKey` of 'g' has 'IL' (Illinois) as its location. Therefore, based on the provided data, the answer to the question \"What is the location of record with primeKey g\" is 'IL'.\n\nIf you were programming this, you could use tools such as regular expressions to search for lines that begin with 'g' followed by a tab or space delimiter, or you could use a CSV parser if this data is in a CSV format, specifying whitespace or tabs as delimiters. Then you would isolate the field that corresponds to the location for that specific record."
