Some answers might be dependent on information that is not directly provided within the question but might be inferred from previous sections or even external resources linked within the Markdown file.\n\n3. **Handling Ambiguity**: Questions may be ambiguous or open to interpretation. The parser must handle these cases, possibly by returning multiple valid answers or asking for clarification.\n\n4. **Nested Information**: QAs might be nested in bullet points or within sections that have their own titles and text blocks. This requires the parser to maintain a hierarchy of information and understand the scope of each answer.\n\n5. **Links and References**: The Markdown file may contain links to external sources or references to other parts of the document that contain relevant information for the answer. This means the parser should be capable of recognizing these and deciding if it needs to follow these links for additional context.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Formatting**: Some answers might contain code snippets or other preformatted text that needs to be interpreted differently from regular Markdown text - for example, not removing indentation or mistaking underscores in variable names for italic formatting.\n\n7. **Non-standard Extensions**: Markdown supports various non-standard extensions that might be used in the document (like tables, footnotes, definition lists, etc.). The parser must be able to recognize and handle these appropriately.\n\n8. **Metadata**: The file might contain metadata that needs to be interpreted, such as YAML front matter or HTML comments.\n\n9. **Statefulness**: Some QAs depend on previous interaction, meaning that the state or previous answers need to be remembered to correctly understand and answer subsequent questions.\n\n10. **Document Structure Recognition**: The parser needs to recognize the overall structure of the document to identify where questions end and answers begin, especially if they are not explicitly labeled.\n\n11. **User Intents and Commands**: If the file includes command-like statements or requires the user to perform actions (like executing a script), the parser might need to recognize and simulate these actions rather than execute them.\n\nEach of these challenges must be addressed by developing an appropriate strategy for parsing, such as regular expressions for syntax"

        "To extract all included image files from the given Markdown file, you need to search for image inclusion syntax typical in Markdown. In Markdown, images are typically included using the following syntax:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `![Alt text]` is an optional alt attribute for the image\n- `(URL)` is the path to the image file\n- `\"Optional title\"` is an optional title attribute that appears on hover\n\nGiven this syntax, here are the steps to find and extract the image file names:\n\n1. Scan through each line of the input file's content.\n2. Look for lines that contain the pattern `![alt](image_url \"hover text\")`.\n3. Extract the portion of the line that matches this pattern, specifically capturing the `image_url` part.\n4. Output each extracted image file name, separating them by newlines (`\\n`).\n\nYou can achieve this using regular expressions. In many programming languages, a regular expression to find such patterns may look like this:\n\n```regex\n!\\[alt\\]\\((.*?) \"hover text\"\\)\n```\n\nWithin this regular expression:\n- `\\(` and `\\)` escape the parentheses to match them literally.\n- `(.*?)` is a non-greedy capture group that matches any characters and stops at the first instance of the following pattern.\n\nFor each match found using this regular expression, you would use the captured group as the image file name.\n\nApplying this pattern to the provided file content (using a pseudo-code or a scripting language), you would extract the following image file names, each on a new line:\n```\nne.png\noe.gif\npe.jpeg\nqe.png\nre.jpeg\nse.jpg\nte.png\nue.jpeg\n```\n\nThese file names are then printed out separated by newlines (`\\n`).
