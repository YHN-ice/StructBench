            "content": "When parsing a Markdown file to extract information or answer questions, several challenges may arise:\n\n1. **Ambiguity in Formatting:** Markdown can be written in various styles, and different implementations might interpret the syntax slightly differently. Ambiguity in formatting elements like headings, lists, or code blocks can lead to misinterpretation of the structure.\n\n2. **Nested Structures:** Markdown allows for nested structures such as lists within lists or blockquotes within blockquotes. Parsing these correctly to maintain the hierarchy can be complex.\n\n3. **Inline Markup and Special Characters:** Markdown supports inline markup such as bold, italics, and links, which can appear alongside regular text. Special characters like asterisks, underscores, and backticks can have multiple meanings, making it challenging to determine their role without context.\n\n4. **Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting:** Code blocks may contain text that looks like Markdown syntax but should not be parsed as such because they are meant to be displayed as code. Additionally, some Markdown flavors support syntax highlighting that may include extra language-specific tags.\n\n5. **Link References and Images:** Markdown allows for the use of reference-style links and image embeddings, where the URL or source is not immediately next to its display text or alt text. This separation can make it harder to parse.\n\n6. **Extensions and Flavors:** There are multiple \"flavors\" of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.) that introduce their own extensions and variations on the standard syntax. Parsing must account for these differences if the input file uses a specific flavor.\n\n7. **HTML Blocks and Inline HTML:** Markdown supports the inclusion of HTML blocks and spans, which must be treated differently from regular Markdown syntax during parsing.\n\n8. **Metadata and Front Matter:** Some Markdown files include metadata or \"front matter\" at the beginning of the file, typically delimited by lines of dashes or triple dots. This section might need special handling depending on the parser's purpose.\n\n9. **Contextual Interpretation:** The meaning of certain parts of the text may depend on context, which a simple line-by-line parser may not handle well without more sophisticated analysis.\n\n10. **Human Errors:** Typos, incorrect usage of syntax, or inconsistencies in formatting introduced by the author can make automated parsing difficult.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a comprehensive Markdown parser would need to:\n\n- Carefully define the supported syntax and strictly adhere to it.\n- Use a robust parsing strategy that can handle nested structures and inline markup"

        "To answer the question \"Extract all included image files. Print those file names separated by \\n,\" you would need to parse the provided text and look for Markdown image syntax. The Markdown syntax for images typically looks like this:\n\n```\n![alt text](image_filename \"optional title\")\n```\n\nThe task is to extract the `image_filename` part.\n\nFrom the provided text, you can see several instances of this pattern. To get the answer manually, you would search for all occurrences of `![alt]` followed by the parentheses containing the image file name. Then, you would extract the text between the parentheses but excluding the quotation marks and alt text. This would give you the image file names.\n\nHere are the image files included in the text:\n\n1. `![alt](fe.jpg \"hover text\")`\n2. `![alt](ge.png \"hover text\")`\n3. `![alt](he.png \"hover text\")`\n4. `![alt](ie.jpeg \"hover text\")`\n5. `![alt](je.gif \"hover text\")`\n6. `![alt](ke.jpeg \"hover text\")`\n\nExtracting the file names from these patterns, you get:\n\n```\nfe.jpg\nge.png\nhe.png\nie.jpeg\nje.gif\nke.jpeg\n```\n\nSeparating them by `\\n` (newline), as requested, you would print them as follows:\n\n```\nfe.jpg\nge.png\nhe.png\nie.jpeg\nje.gif\nke.jpeg\n```\n\nThis is the answer that should be provided given the instructions and the input file."
