Not all parsers handle every aspect of Markdown equally well.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a Markdown file parser needs to be robust and flexible in terms of handling different Markdown syntaxes and structures and should gracefully handle exceptions and edge cases. Additionally, it may need to incorporate some level of natural language processing to understand the context around questions and answers within the document."
