        "To extract all included image files from the provided file and print the filenames separated by `\\n`, you would need to identify the pattern that denotes image links in Markdown. In Markdown, images are often embedded with the following syntax:\n\n```\n![alt text](image_filename.extension \"optional title\")\n```\n\nFor example, the string `![alt](vf.gif \"hover text\")` within the file denotes an image with the filename `vf.gif`.\n\nTo extract the image filenames, you would parse the file and look for occurrences of this pattern. You can do this manually by reading through the file or programmatically by using regular expressions or a Markdown parsing library.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to manually extracting the image filenames:\n\n1. Identify lines that contain the image embedding pattern `![alt](image_filename.extension \"optional title\")`.\n2. Extract the part that corresponds to `image_filename.extension` from each occurrence.\n3. Print or list the extracted filenames, separating them with a newline character `\\n`.\n\nDoing this for the provided file content yields the following list of image filenames:\n\n```\nvf.gif\nwf.jpeg\nxf.jpeg\nyf.gif\nzf.jpg\nag.jpeg\nbg.jpg\n```\n\nPrinted with each filename on a new line:\n\n```\nvf.gif\nwf.jpeg\nxf.jpeg\nyf.gif\nzf.jpg\nag.jpeg\nbg.jpg\n```\n\nNote that I have excluded any formatting, including asterisks, hashes, and other non-image related content.
