Properly parsing these to extract meaningful data might be challenging.\n\n10. **Identifying Relevant Sections**: Questions may pertain to a specific part of the document, and identifying that section accurately will be key to providing the correct answer.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust Markdown parser should be developed with attention to these details, possibly employing advanced text analysis and natural language understanding techniques."
