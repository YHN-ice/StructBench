Here are some potential challenges:\n\n1. **Ambiguity in the Questions**: Without clear and specific questions, it can be difficult to determine exactly what information to extract from the file.\n\n2. **Complex File Structure**: Markdown files can have various levels of headings, nested lists, code blocks, tables, and other formatting elements. Understanding the structure and hierarchy is crucial to locating the correct information.\n\n3. **Non-Standard Markdown**: If the Markdown file uses non-standard syntax or custom extensions, a parser might not recognize these without specific rules or configurations.\n\n4. **Variability in Formatting**: Different authors may use different conventions for emphasizing points or structuring content, which could make it hard to consistently parse information.\n\n5. **Contextual Information**: Sometimes, an answer might depend on context that is not immediately adjacent to the question within the text.
