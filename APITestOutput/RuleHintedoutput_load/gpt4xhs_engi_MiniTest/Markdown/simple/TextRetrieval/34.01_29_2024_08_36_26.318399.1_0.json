These elements include headers (denoted by `#`), lists (unordered `-` or `*`, and ordered `1.`), links (`[text](url)`), images (`![alt text](url)`), code blocks (indented with four spaces or fenced by `` ``` ``), emphasis (`*italic*` or `**bold**`), and more. If the parser does not correctly interpret these syntax elements, it might not extract the necessary information accurately.\n\n2. **Nested Structures**: Markdown allows for nested structures, such as lists within lists or blockquotes within list items. Properly navigating and interpreting these nested structures is essential to understanding the context and hierarchy of the information presented.\n\n3. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Code blocks and inline code snippets use backticks (`` ` ``) in Markdown. It's important to distinguish between actual code and regular text, as code often does not follow natural language rules and may contain keywords that could mislead an interpretation.\n\n4. **Links and References**: Links in Markdown can be inline or reference style. The parser must handle both correctly to extract URLs or linked page titles when needed.\n\n5. **Ambiguity in Headers**: Headers might not always clearly denote question-answer pairs or section boundaries, making it difficult to parse out individual Q&A pairs if that's the required format.\n\n6. **Metadata**: The file may contain metadata (such as titles, authors, dates) that requires different processing from the main content.\n\n7. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: There are different \"flavors\" of Markdown (such as GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), which have slight differences in syntax rules. Knowing which flavor the document adheres to is important for correct parsing.\n\n8. **Contextual Interpretation**: Questions often require an understanding of the context within which they are asked. This can be especially challenging for a parser if the answer relies on implied knowledge or is spread across multiple sections of the document.\n\n9. **Non-textual Content**: Some Markdown files might include images, tables, or other non-textual content that a parser might need to describe or reference.\n\n10. **Multiple Answers**: For some questions, there might be multiple valid answers scattered throughout the document.

        "The correct response to the input question \"Extract all bold texts.
