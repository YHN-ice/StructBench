        "To answer the question provided, which asks for the most deeply nested objects in the JSON file that do not contain any further list or dict values, we need to parse the JSON structure and retrieve the nested objects that meet this criterion. Here's how to approach the problem:\n\n1. Parse the JSON file to convert it into a data structure that can be manipulated in your programming language of choice (e.g., dictionaries and lists in Python).\n\n2. Traverse the parsed JSON structure recursively, looking for objects that do not contain any more nested lists or dictionaries.\n\n3. Maintain a record of objects encountered that satisfy the condition of being the most deeply nested without further list or dict values.\n\n4. Extract these objects and format them according to the requirements, separating them by \"\\n\\n\" if there's more than one.\n\nGiven the JSON file provided in the question, we would go through the following steps:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"w\",\n  \"Z\": \"v\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"x\",\n      \"Y\": \"u\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"y\",\n          \"X\": \"t\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nUsing the information in this JSON structure:\n\n- The outermost object has an \"id\" of \"w\" and contains a list under the key \"subs\", so it is not the most deeply nested without further lists or dicts.\n- The next object has an \"id\" of \"x\" and also contains a list under \"subs\".\n- The innermost object has an \"id\" of \"y\", and its \"subs\" list is empty, meaning it does not contain further nested objects or arrays.\n\nSo, the most deeply nested object without further lists or dicts is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"y\",\n  \"X\": \"t\",\n  \"subs\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis is a direct excerpt from the JSON file as it appears, which is what the question asks for. If there were multiple such objects, they would be separated by \"\\n\\n\". However, since there's only one such object in this example, this single excerpt is the answer."
