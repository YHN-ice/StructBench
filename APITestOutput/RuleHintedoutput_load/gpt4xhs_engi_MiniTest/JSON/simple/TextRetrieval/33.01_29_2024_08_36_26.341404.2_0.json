        "To get the answer from the JSON file specified in the input, follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the JSON file: Start by reading the JSON content and parse it using a JSON parsing library relevant to your programming language. For example, in Python, you would use the `json` module.\n\n2. Navigate through the JSON structure: After parsing, you'll have a data structure that represents the JSON content (typically a dictionary or an object). You'll need to navigate through this structure based on the hierarchy defined in the JSON. For the given example, you'd look for the top-level \"subs\" array, then examine each object within that array to find nested \"subs\" arrays.\n\n3. Locate the required object: Continue to navigate through nested \"subs\" until you find an object with an \"id\" key that has a value of \"e\". This exploration can be done recursively or iteratively.\n\n4. Extract and format the answer: Once the desired object is found, extract it and format it as required for the answer. The extracted part should be a valid JSON snippet that represents the object with \"id\" value \"e\".\n\nHere is an example of how you might perform these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Simulating reading from a JSON file\njson_content = '''\n{\n  \"id\":\"c\",\n  \"Z\":\"i\",\n  \"subs\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"d\",\n      \"Y\":\"h\",\n      \"subs\":[\n        {\n          \"id\":\"e\",\n          \"X\":\"g\",\n          \"subs\":[]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n'''\n\n# Parse the JSON content\ndata = json.loads(json_content)\n\n# Function to recursively search for an object by id\ndef find_object_by_id(obj, target_id):\n    # Check if the current object is the one we're looking for\n    if obj.get(\"id\") == target_id:\n        return obj\n    \n    # If not, search in the \"subs\" array if it exists\n    for sub_obj in obj.get(\"subs\", []):\n        result = find_object_by_id(sub_obj, target_id)\n        if result:\n            return result\n    return None\n\n# Find the object with id 'e'\ntarget_object = find_object_by_id(data, 'e')\n\n# Format the answer as a JSON string if the object was found\nanswer = json.dumps(target_object, indent=2) if target_object else \"{}\"\n\nprint(answer)\n"
