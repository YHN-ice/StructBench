Access the \"subs\" key, which contains an array: `obj[\"subs\"]`.\n3. In this array, we want the first object, so we access index 0: `obj[\"subs\"][0]`.\n4. Inside this object, there is another \"subs\" key with an array: `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"]`.\n5. Again, we want the first object in this inner array, so we access index 0: `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0]`.\n6.
