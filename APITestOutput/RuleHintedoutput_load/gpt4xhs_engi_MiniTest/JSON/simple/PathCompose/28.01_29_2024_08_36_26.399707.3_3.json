This could require special handling for streaming the data or managing memory usage.\n\n3. **Data Types and Formats**: JSON supports various data types such as string, number, object, array, true, false, and null. Ensuring that these data types are correctly interpreted and formatted when retrieved is important, especially when dealing with dates, escaping characters, and internationalization.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: If the file is not properly encoded as UTF-8 or if it contains special characters, there might be issues with reading the file correctly.\n\n5. **Errors in JSON Syntax**: Any syntax errors in the JSON file (like missing commas or brackets) can prevent the file from being parsed successfully.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Questions**: The questions themselves might be ambiguous or lack context, making it difficult to determine what specific information is being requested.\n\n7. **Versioning and Updates**: If the JSON file structure has versions or is likely to be updated, the parser must be adaptable to changes to continue functioning correctly.\n\n8. **Security Concerns**: If the JSON data comes from an untrusted source, there may be security implications, such as injection attacks, that need to be mitigated.\n\n9. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Sometimes, the data expected may not be present in the JSON file, or it may be incomplete, which would make answering some questions impossible.\n\n10. **Performance Optimization**: Efficiently parsing and extracting information without unnecessary computational overhead is important, especially if the parser needs to be used frequently or on resource-constrained systems.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful planning, robust error handling, and potentially using specialized libraries or tools designed for parsing and querying JSON data."

Within `obj`, there is a key `\"subs\"` which contains an array. Access the first element of this array using `[0]`.\n3. Within this element (which is also an object), there is another key `\"subs\"` containing another array. Again, access the first element of this array using `[0]`.\n4.
