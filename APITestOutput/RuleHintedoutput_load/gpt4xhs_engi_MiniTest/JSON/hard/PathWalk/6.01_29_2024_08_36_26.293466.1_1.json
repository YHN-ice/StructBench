Inconsistencies in key names or data formats across the file can also lead to difficulties in parsing.\n\n6. **Encoding**: The file could be encoded in a way that isn't directly compatible with the parsing tool, requiring decoding or conversion before parsing.\n\n7. **Lack of Schema**: Without a schema or documentation for the JSON file, understanding the meaning and relationships of the data can be challenging.\n\n8. **Accessing Nested Keys**: Accessing values deep within nested objects or arrays may require iterative approaches or recursive functions.\n\n9. **Query Complexity**: Depending on the nature of the question, you may need to perform complex queries or aggregations on the data, which might not be straightforward.\n\n10. **Performance Constraints**: If the parser has to work within strict performance constraints, optimizing queries and handling the data efficiently becomes crucial.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it is important to understand the structure of the JSON file beforehand, ensure that the parser can handle the file's size and complexity, and know what type of information is being requested to navigate to the correct part of the JSON structure quickly and efficiently."
