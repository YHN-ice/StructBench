Here are some that might arise:\n\n1. **Complex Nesting**:\n   Deeply nested structures in JSON can make it more challenging to extract information. It requires careful traversal of the JSON tree and understanding the relationships between objects.\n\n2. **Large File Size**:\n   A large file size could lead to performance issues or increased memory usage when parsing the file, especially if the entire file must be read into memory at once.\n\n3. **Data Types and Formats**:\n   JSON supports different data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. The parser must correctly handle each type and format, including date formats or other custom data types that might require conversion.\n\n4. **Encoding and Special Characters**:\n   JSON is typically UTF-8 encoded, but if the file uses a different encoding or contains special characters, it may need additional processing to ensure accurate interpretation.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**:\n   Invalid JSON syntax can lead to parsing errors. The parser must either be capable of handling minor errors gracefully or provide clear error messages to help identify and correct syntax issues.\n\n6. **References and Dependencies**:\n   If the JSON contains references to other parts of the file or external dependencies, the parser must resolve these references to get the correct answer.\n\n7. **Ambiguous Keys or Values**:\n   Keys that are not unique or values that are ambiguous can make it difficult to determine the correct data to extract.\n\n8. **Missing or Incomplete Data**:\n   If the necessary data to answer a question is missing or incomplete, it might be impossible to provide a correct answer.\n\n9. **Security Concerns**:\n   If the JSON file comes from an untrusted source, there could be security risks such as injection attacks. The parser must be secure against such vulnerabilities.\n\n10. **Updates and Versioning**:\n    If there are different versions of the file format, the parser may need to support multiple versions or be aware of which version it is working with to correctly interpret the data.\n\n11. **Data Context and Semantics**:\n    Understanding the context and semantics of the data is necessary for answering questions correctly, especially if the question requires knowledge not explicitly stated in the file.\n\nTo overcome these hurdles, we would need robust JSON parsing logic that can handle all the mentioned complexities, as well as additional checks or pre-processing steps"

        "To answer the question \"What is the first object's id of subs?\" from the given file, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the JSON data: Read the JSON-formatted string into a data structure that can be easily manipulated in the programming language being used. This typically involves using a JSON library which converts the JSON string into a data structure such as a dictionary in Python, an object in JavaScript, etc.\n\n2.
