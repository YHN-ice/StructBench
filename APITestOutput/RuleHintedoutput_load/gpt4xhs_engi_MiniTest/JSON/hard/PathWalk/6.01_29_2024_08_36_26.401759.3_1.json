Nesting and Structure: JSON files can have a deeply nested structure which can make it complicated to navigate to the correct piece of data needed to answer a question.\n\n3. Data Types and Formats: JSON supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.

Ambiguity in Questions: The questions might be ambiguous or lack context, making it challenging to determine what specific data is being requested.\n\n6. Key-Value Pairs: JSON files are composed of key-value pairs; if keys are not known or are dynamically generated, it may be difficult to access the correct values.\n\n7. Encoding Issues: The file might use different character encoding, which could cause issues when trying to read and interpret text data.\n\n8. Schema Changes: If the schema (structure) of the JSON file changes without notice, previously working parsing logic may no longer be valid.\n\n9. Query Complexity: The question may require complex queries or aggregations that are not straightforward in JSON parsing (e.g., summing up values, finding averages).\n\n10.
