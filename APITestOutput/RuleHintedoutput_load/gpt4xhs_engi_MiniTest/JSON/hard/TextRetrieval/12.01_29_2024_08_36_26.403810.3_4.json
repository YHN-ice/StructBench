        "To get the answer from the file as specified in the input, you need to parse the JSON structure and look for the objects that are most deeply nested and do not contain any lists or dictionaries as values. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can extract the required information:\n\n1. Parse the JSON data: You first need to read and parse the JSON content using a JSON parser, which is available in most programming languages, e.g., `json` module in Python.\n\n2. Recursively traverse the nested structure: After parsing, you will have a data structure that reflects the nested objects in the JSON file. You need to recursively traverse this structure to find objects at the deepest level.\n\n3. Check for lists or dicts: While traversing, you need to check each object to see if it contains a list or a dictionary as a value. In the given example, you need to look at the 'subs' key and check if it is empty.\n\n4. Collect deeply nested objects: If an object has an empty 'subs' list (i.e., no further nesting), then it qualifies as a deeply nested object with no value of type list or dict.\n\n5. Format and separate the results: Once you have identified all such objects, format them as required (in this case, as JSON objects) and separate each with \"\\n\\n\".\n\nFor the given JSON structure, you would end up with a list of objects that have empty 'subs' lists, which are the most deeply nested ones â€“ these are the ones provided in the answer section of the input.\n\nThe challenges and obstacles listed would potentially impact this process, especially when dealing with more complex or larger JSON files, but given the relatively simple structure of the provided JSON, they would be minimal in this case."
