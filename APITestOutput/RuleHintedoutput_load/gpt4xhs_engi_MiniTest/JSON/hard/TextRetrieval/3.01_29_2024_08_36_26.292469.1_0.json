        "To answer the question \"What is the object with id z?\" from the given JSON file, you need to parse the JSON structure and locate the object that has an \"id\" key with the value \"z\". Here is a step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Parse the JSON file**: Use a JSON parser that can handle the file's size and complexity to convert the JSON content into a structured format that you can navigate programmatically.\n\n2. **Navigate the JSON structure**: Traverse the parsed JSON data starting from the top-level object, looking into each \"subs\" array recursively until you find an object with an \"id\" key that has the value \"z\".\n\n3. **Extract the Object**: Once you have located the object with \"id\": \"z\", extract the entire object as it appears in the JSON file.\n\n4. **Provide the Answer**: Format the extracted object in JSON syntax as your output.\n\nHere's how you might write pseudocode for these steps:\n\n```pseudocode\nfunction findObjectById(jsonData, targetId):\n    if jsonData.get(\"id\") == targetId:\n        return jsonData\n    if \"subs\" in jsonData:\n        for subObject in jsonData[\"subs\"]:\n            result = findObjectById(subObject, targetId)\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n    return None\n\njsonData = parseJson(fileContent)  // Assuming fileContent holds the JSON from your file\ntargetId = \"z\"\nanswerObject = findObjectById(jsonData, targetId)\n\nif answerObject is not None:\n    print(formatAsJson(answerObject))\nelse:\n    print(\"Object with id z not found.\")\n```\n\nIn this specific case, navigating through the provided JSON structure, you would find that the object with \"id\": \"z\" is nested within the first object of the \"subs\" array under the top-level object with \"id\": \"u\", and within the second object of \"subs\" under \"id\": \"v\". Once located, you would extract and output it as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"z\",\n  \"R\": \"b\",\n  \"Q\": \"a\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"ab\",\n      \"P\": \"zy\",\n      \"subs\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"bb\",\n      \"O\": \"yy\",\n      \"subs\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis result matches the answer provided"
