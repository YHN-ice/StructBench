        "\nTo answer the question \"What is the object with id cb?\" using the provided JSON file, one would need to parse the file and search for the object where the \"id\" field matches the string \"cb.\" Given that JSON is a structured format, one can usually use a JSON parsing library available in many programming languages to easily handle the data.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to finding the object with id \"cb\":\n\n1. Load the provided JSON content into a variable. Depending on the programming language being used, this might involve using a function like `json.load()` in Python or `JSON.parse()` in JavaScript.\n\n2. Iterate through the top-level \"subs\" array looking for an object with an \"id\" key that has the value \"cb.\"\n\n3. If such an object is encountered at this level, return or print out the object. If not found, continue to search recursively within the \"subs\" arrays of each item.\n\n4. Repeat this process until the object with \"id\": \"cb\" is found or until all objects have been searched.\n\nGiven that we have the JSON content available, a pseudo-code to find the answer could be something like this:\n\n```pseudo\nfunction findObjectById(jsonObject, targetId):\n    if jsonObject[\"id\"] == targetId:\n        return jsonObject\n    else if \"subs\" in jsonObject and isinstance(jsonObject[\"subs\"], list):\n        for subObject in jsonObject[\"subs\"]:\n            result = findObjectById(subObject, targetId)\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n    return None\n\njsonContent = [paste the JSON file content here]\ntargetId = \"cb\"\nresultObject = findObjectById(jsonContent, targetId)\n\nif resultObject is not None:\n    print(resultObject)\nelse:\n    print(\"Object with id\", targetId, \"not found.\")\n```\n\nAfter running this pseudo-code with the given JSON file, it would output the following JSON object because it matches the \"id\" with \"cb\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"cb\",\n  \"I\": \"ny\",\n  \"H\": \"my\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"db\",\n      \"G\": \"ly\",\n      \"F\": \"ky\",\n      \"subs\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"eb\",\n      \"E\": \"jy\",\n      \"D\": \"iy\",\n      \"subs\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n``"
