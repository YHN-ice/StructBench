        "To retrieve the most deeply nested objects without any nested lists or dictionaries as values, you can write a recursive function that traverses the JSON structure. The function would look for objects (dictionaries in Python) that have no further nested lists or dictionaries. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to write such a function and get the answer:\n\n1. **Parse the JSON**: First, parse the JSON content using a JSON parser. In Python, you would use `json.loads()`.\n\n2. **Recursive Traversal**: Define a recursive function that will traverse the JSON structure. This function should:\n\n    - Accept an object (dictionary) and a list to store results.\n    - Iterate over each key-value pair in the object.\n    - If a value is a dictionary and its \"subs\" list is empty, append it to the results list.\n    - If a value is a list, call the function recursively for each element in the list that is a dictionary.\n\n3. **Collect Results**: Execute the recursive function starting with the top-level object and an empty list to collect results.\n\n4. **Format Output**: Format the objects collected into the desired string format, separated by double newlines (`\\n\\n`).\n\nHere's a sample Python code to illustrate the process:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_deepest_objects(obj, results):\n    # Check if the given object is not a list and does not contain any nested lists or dicts\n    if isinstance(obj, dict) and all(not isinstance(v, (list, dict)) for v in obj.values()):\n        results.append(obj)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for nested structures\n    for value in obj.values():\n        if isinstance(value, list):\n            # Recursively search each item in the list\n            for item in value:\n                find_deepest_objects(item, results)\n\n# Sample JSON content as provided\njson_content = '''\n{\n\"id\":\"q\",\n...\n}\n'''\n\n# Parse the JSON content\nparsed_json = json.loads(json_content)\n\n# Find deepest objects\nresults = []\nfind_deepest_objects(parsed_json, results)\n\n# Format output\nformatted_output = \"\\n\\n\".join(json.dumps(result, indent=2) for result in results)\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nRunning this code with the provided JSON file content will produce the desired output with all deeply nested objects having no further nested lists or dictionaries as their values. The output will be in the same format as provided in the answer"
