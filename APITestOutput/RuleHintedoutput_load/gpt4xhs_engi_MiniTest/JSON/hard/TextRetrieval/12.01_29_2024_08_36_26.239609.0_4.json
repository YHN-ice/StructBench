        "To obtain the most deeply nested objects that do not contain any further lists or dicts as values, you need to parse the JSON file and recursively inspect each object. The goal is to find objects where all of their 'subs' arrays are empty, indicating no further nesting.\n\nHere's a simplified process using Python as a pseudo-code example:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the JSON data from the file\nwith open('input.json', 'r') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Recursive function to find the most deeply nested objects\ndef find_deepest_objects(obj, result):\n    # Check if 'subs' exists and is an empty list\n    if 'subs' in obj and not obj['subs']:\n        result.append(obj)\n    else:\n        # If 'subs' is not empty, recursively search in each sub-object\n        for sub_obj in obj.get('subs', []):\n            find_deepest_objects(sub_obj, result)\n\n# List to hold the results\nresult = []\nfind_deepest_objects(data, result)\n\n# Print the results\nfor obj in result:\n    # Convert each object to a JSON string and print it\n    print(json.dumps(obj, indent=2))\n    print(\"\\n\")  # Print a newline between each object for separation\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'input.json'` with the correct path to your JSON file. The above script does not print exactly in the format specified in the Answer section because it uses `json.dumps` for formatting, which may differ slightly. However, it should give you the gist of how to extract the deeply nested objects with empty 'subs' lists.\n\nThe given answer seems to have been extracted manually or by a script that formats the JSON output in a very specific way, which is not standard JSON output formatting.
