        "To get the answer from the file provided in the input, you would follow these steps:\n\n1. **Parse the JSON**: Use a JSON parser to convert the JSON-formatted string into a data structure that can be manipulated by the programming language you are using (e.g., a dictionary in Python).\n\n2. **Traverse the Data Structure**: Write a recursive function that will traverse the nested data structure created from the JSON file.\n\n3. **Identify Deepest Objects**: As you traverse, check each object's `\"subs\"` key to see if it is an empty list `[]`. If so, this indicates that the object is deeply nested and has no further nested list or dict values.\n\n4. **Collect and Format the Results**: When you encounter such an object, store it in a collection while maintaining its original format. If multiple such objects exist, make sure to separate each by `\\n\\n` as specified in the input.\n\n5. **Output the Results**: After traversing the entire structure, return or print out the collected results.\n\nHere's a simple conceptual example using Python:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Sample JSON content from the file\njson_content = '''\n{\n  \"id\": \"u\",\n  ... (rest of the JSON content) ...\n}\n'''\n\n# Parse the JSON content into a Python dictionary\ndata = json.loads(json_content)\n\ndef find_deepest_objects(obj):\n    # Check if 'subs' is an empty list, indicating no further nesting\n    if 'subs' in obj and not obj['subs']:\n        # Format the object as a JSON string\n        return [json.dumps(obj, indent=2)]\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, recursively look for deeper nested objects\n        results = []\n        for sub in obj.get('subs', []):\n            results.extend(find_deepest_objects(sub))\n        return results\n\n# Start from the root of the data structure\ndeepest_objects = find_deepest_objects(data)\n\n# Join the results with newlines as specified\noutput = \"\\n\\n\".join(deepest_objects)\n\n# Output or return the result\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe provided Python code is a high-level conceptual demonstration.
