The parser must be able to correctly interpret all these elements.\n\n2. **Structure and Hierarchy**: ORG files have a hierarchical structure (e.g., sections, sub-sections). Understanding the hierarchy is crucial to locate the correct information in response to a query.\n\n3. **Metadata**: ORG files can include metadata (tags, properties, etc.). If the question requires metadata interpretation, the parser must be capable of handling it.\n\n4. **Dynamic Content**: Some ORG files might include dynamic content through macros or code blocks that are evaluated when the file is processed with an ORG mode-aware tool.\n\n5. **Context Sensitivity**: The meaning of certain portions of text may depend on context which could be challenging to interpret for a parser.\n\n6. **Links and References**: ORG files may contain links to other parts of the same document or external resources, which may be necessary to follow to answer a question.\n\n7. **File Size and Complexity**: If the ORG file is large or particularly convoluted, finding the relevant information quickly could be challenging.\n\n8. **Embedded Content**: There may be content embedded in the file (like source code or images) that needs special handling or cannot be interpreted textually.\n\n9. **Versioning and Compatibility**: ORG files might have been created with different versions of Org mode, which can introduce variations in the way certain constructs are used or interpreted.\n\n10. **Natural Language Processing**: Some questions may require understanding natural language rather than just extracting structured data, which could necessitate more sophisticated processing techniques.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser might need to employ a combination of syntactic analysis, pattern matching, hierarchical navigation, metadata processing, and possibly some level of natural language understanding. It's important to note that without specific knowledge about the structure and content of the input ORG file, these points remain speculative."

        "To extract all included image files and print their file names separated by a newline from the given file, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the syntax used for embedding images within the file. From the given file, it looks like image files are included with double square brackets surrounding the file name (e.g., `[[jh.png]]`).\n\n2. Scan through each line of the file to find any text that matches the image embedding syntax.\n\n3. Extract the image file names from the matched text. This typically involves removing the surrounding syntax to isolate the file name.\n\n4. Print the extracted file names, each separated by a newline character (`\\n`).\n\nFor the example provided, you can use text processing methods like regular expressions to locate and extract the image file names. Here's a step-by-step breakdown using regex:\n\n- A regular expression that matches the image embedding syntax could look something like this: `\\[\\[(.+?)\\]\\]`. This regex captures any string that starts with `[[`, followed by any characters lazily matched (`.+?`), and then ends with `]]`.\n\n- Apply this regex to each line in the given text to capture all instances of image file names.\n\n- Extract the captured groups (which will be the image file names without the surrounding `[[` and `]]`).\n\n- Print each image file name on a new line.\n\nHere's a list of extracted image file names based on the example provided:\n\n```\njh.png\nkh.gif\nlh.jpg\nmh.jpeg\nnh.gif\noh.png\nph.png\n```\n\nThis is how you would obtain your answer by processing the text manually or using a script.
