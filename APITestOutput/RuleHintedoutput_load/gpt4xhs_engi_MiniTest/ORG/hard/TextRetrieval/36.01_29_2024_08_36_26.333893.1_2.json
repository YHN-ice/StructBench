Parsing these accurately requires a clear understanding of the context and purpose of each block.\n\n3. **File Encoding and Characters**: The file encoding must be correctly handled to ensure special characters and non-ASCII text are interpreted properly.\n\n4. **Metadata and Document Properties**: ORG files often include metadata (tags, properties, etc.) that may need to be taken into account when answering questions.\n\n5. **Dynamic Content**: Some content in ORG files can be dynamic, such as links that pull in external content, or macros that change based on certain conditions.\n\n6. **Contextual Interpretation**: Questions may require understanding the context, which can be challenging when elements are not self-contained and depend on preceding or following content.\n\n7. **Incomplete or Ambiguous Information**: The file might not have all the necessary information to answer the question, or the information could be ambiguous.\n\n8. **Search and Retrieval**: Efficient search mechanisms need to be in place to quickly locate relevant information within a potentially large file.\n\n9. **Version Management**: If the file has a version history or if there are multiple versions of the file, it is important to make sure the correct version is being parsed.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a parser must be well-designed with a strong understanding of the ORG format, capable of handling different data types and structures, and equipped with algorithms for searching and interpreting context."

        "To answer the question \"Extract all included image files. Print those file names separated by \\n,\" we will manually parse the provided text to identify patterns that show the inclusion of image files. In this case, the image files are identified by their file extensions (e.g., .png, .jpeg, .jpg, .gif) and are enclosed within double brackets `[[` and `]]`. Parsing this text requires recognizing and extracting the substrings that match these patterns.\n\nHere is the process you could follow to manually extract the image file names:\n\n1. Scan through the text and look for the double bracket pattern `[[` and `]]`.\n2. Verify that the text inside the brackets ends with a recognized image file extension.\n3. Once an image file is identified, extract the file name, including its extension.\n4. Separate each file name with a newline character `\\n`.\n\nBy manually examining the provided text, we can list the included image file names:\n\n```\ngi.gif\nhi.jpeg\nii.jpg\nji.png\nki.png\nli.png\nmi.png\nni.jpeg\noi.png\n```\n\nThese file names are extracted from the parts of the text where they are enclosed in double brackets, indicating that they are image files to be included.
