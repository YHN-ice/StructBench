Properly interpreting these hierarchies is crucial to understanding the context and content of the file.\n\n3. **Metadata**: ORG files may contain various metadata fields such as TODO states, tags, properties, and timestamps. Parsing and interpreting this metadata correctly can be challenging.\n\n4. **Dynamic Content**: ORG mode supports dynamic content like TODO lists, agenda views, and clock tables which might require a context or specific actions to be fully understood or generated.\n\n5. **Embedded Code**: ORG files can include source code blocks that can be executed within the document. Understanding whether and how to evaluate these blocks requires careful consideration.\n\n6. **File References**: The file might have links to external content or other internal sections of the document that may need resolution to fully understand the content.\n\n7. **Formatting**: Text formatting such as bold, italic, underlined text, and strike-through must be correctly interpreted if it affects the meaning of the content.\n\n8. **Version Compatibility**: Different versions of ORG mode may have slightly different features or syntax, which could affect parsing.\n\n9. **Textual Ambiguity**: Natural language contained within an ORG file can inherently be ambiguous and interpreting it correctly may require context or additional information outside of the file itself.\n\n10. **Interactive Features**: Some features of ORG mode are interactive (like links or checkboxes), which may not translate well into a non-interactive environment or programmatic access.\n\nTo navigate these potential obstacles, a parser would need to be well-designed with an understanding of the ORG syntax and semantics.
