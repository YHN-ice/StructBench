Understanding how these levels interact and how to traverse this hierarchy to find the relevant information is crucial.\n\n3. **Metadata and Properties**: ORG files can contain metadata and properties associated with different sections. Parsing this metadata accurately is necessary to answer questions that depend on this information.\n\n4. **Special Features**: ORG files support a variety of features like TODO items, deadlines, schedules, links, tags, and more. Knowing how to interpret these features in the context of the question is important.\n\n5. **File Size and Complexity**: A large and complex ORG file may make it difficult to quickly locate the needed information.\n\n6. **Dynamic Content**: Some ORG files may include dynamic content generated by embedded code blocks or external links.

        "The provided input data does not appear to be in the standard ORG file format, which is typically associated with Emacs ORG mode. However, the answer to the question suggests that we are dealing with a file format where images are included in a specific syntax, possibly marked by double square brackets (e.g., `[[image.png]]`).\n\nTo extract all included image files and print their names separated by a newline (`\\n`), as requested by the question, follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the content of the provided \"File\" section line by line.\n2. Search for patterns that match the image inclusion syntax, which seems to be `[[image_file_name]]`.\n3.
