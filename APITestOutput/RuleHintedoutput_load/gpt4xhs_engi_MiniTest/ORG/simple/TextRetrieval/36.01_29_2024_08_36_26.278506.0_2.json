        "The question provided specifies the task of extracting all included image file names from the input text (which simulates the content of an ORG file). The filenames to be extracted are enclosed in double square brackets and have standard image file extensions, such as `.jpeg` and `.png`.\n\nHere is how you would extract the image file names from the given text input:\n\n1. **Identify Image Links**: Look for patterns that resemble links to image files. In this case, you are looking for text within double square brackets `[[ ]]`.\n\n2. **Extract Filenames**: Once you've identified the links, you need to extract the portion of the text that represents the filename, which typically includes the name and the file extension.\n\n3. **Output Filenames**: Finally, print the extracted filenames separated by a newline character `\\n`.\n\nFor the provided input text, this process can be demonstrated as follows:\n\nInput Text:\n```\nj\noops yogurt essence perish vig*wake*or wake vigor tra[[pe.jpeg]]nsformer\n* k\nperish yogurt essence perish vigo*X-ray*r wake vigor transformer\n** l\nqualify [[qe.png]]yogurt essence perish vigor wake vigor transformer\n```\n\nExtraction Process:\n- In the line `oops yogurt essence perish vig*wake*or wake vigor tra[[pe.jpeg]]nsformer`, we identify `[[pe.jpeg]]` as an image link. We extract `pe.jpeg` as one of the filenames.\n- Similarly, in the line `qualify [[qe.png]]yogurt essence perish vigor wake vigor transformer`, we identify `[[qe.png]]` as an image link and extract `qe.png` as another filename.\n\nOutput:\n```\npe.jpeg\nqe.png\n```\n\nIn this extraction process, we ignore other text and formatting elements like asterisks `*` and only focus on patterns representing image links.\n\nWhen performing this task programmatically, you can use regular expressions to match and capture the filenames from within the double square brackets. For example, a simple regex pattern such as `\\[\\[(.+?\\.(?:jpeg|png|gif))\\]\\]` could be used to capture image filenames with extensions 'jpeg', 'png', or 'gif'. Note that you would need to adjust the regex pattern based on the specific file types you expect to find."
