If you are not familiar with it, parsing the file correctly can be challenging. Understanding headings, lists, tables, and other elements is crucial.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Structure**: ORG files often contain nested information with a hierarchical structure. Identifying the correct level of information in relation to the question could be complex.\n\n3. **Metadata Extraction**: ORG files can contain metadata (like TODO states, tags, properties) that may be relevant to the question. Parsing and interpreting this metadata correctly is essential.\n\n4. **Dynamic Content**: ORG mode allows for dynamic blocks of content, such as agenda views or result blocks from in-file code execution. If the file relies on such features, static parsing might not suffice.\n\n5. **File Size and Complexity**: Large files with complex structures can make it difficult to find and extract the necessary information quickly and accurately.\n\n6. **Links and References**: ORG files support links to external sources or other parts of the same document. Resolving these links correctly might be necessary to answer the question.\n\n7. **Special Blocks and Syntax**: There could be special blocks like #+BEGIN_SRC for source code or #+BEGIN_QUOTE for quotes; understanding their significance in context is important.\n\n8. **Embedded Code Execution**: If the ORG file contains embedded code that generates part of its content, a parser would need to execute this code to get the full picture, which can be complex or risky.\n\n9. **Formatting Variability**: The formatting of ORG files can vary widely between users. The parser must be flexible enough to handle different styles and conventions.\n\n10. **External Dependencies**: If the ORG file references other files or data sources, it might be necessary to access these to fully understand the content.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser must be robust, handle a wide range of cases, and understand the context of the questions being asked. It also helps if the parser is equipped with the ability to execute code if needed and resolve any external references."
