        "To answer the question \"What is the path from the root node to the node lk?\" using the given file, you can approach it by building a representation of the tree based on the file's format and then traversing this tree to find the desired path.\n\nFirst, you need to parse the file and create a data structure that represents the tree. Given the file format, it appears each line represents a parent-child relationship with a \"->\" delimiter. The left-hand side is the parent node, and the right-hand side is the child node. You would typically use a hash map or dictionary in programming to represent this relationship where each key is a parent node and its value is a list of child nodes.\n\nNext, you would implement a search algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), to traverse the tree from the root node (which seems to be 'v' as it's the starting point of all paths) to find the node 'lk', keeping track of the path as you go.\n\nHere's a high-level pseudocode representation of this process:\n\n```\n1.
