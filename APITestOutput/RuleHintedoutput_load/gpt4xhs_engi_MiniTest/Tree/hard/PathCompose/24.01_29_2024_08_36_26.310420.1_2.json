        "To answer the question \"What is the path from the root node to the node hd?\", you need to parse the Tree file and construct a representation of the tree structure it describes. From this representation, you can then traverse the tree starting from the root node (in this case, 'w') and follow the path of nodes that leads to the node 'hd'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process for how to tackle this problem:\n\n1. **Parse the File**: Read each line of the Tree file and split it into parent-child pairs. You can create a data structure, like a dictionary, where each key is a node and its value is a list of its children.\n\n2. **Construct the Tree**: Using the parent-child pairs, build an internal representation of the tree. This could be in the form of a dictionary with each node as a key, pointing to its respective children nodes.\n\n3. **Find the Path**: To find the path from the root to 'hd', perform a tree traversal starting from the root node 'w'. You can use depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) for this purpose.\n\n4. **Record the Path**: As you traverse the tree, keep track of the path you have taken by appending each visited node to a list or string that records your journey.\n\n5. **Return the Path When 'hd' Is Found**: Once you reach the node 'hd', stop the traversal and return the path you've recorded.\n\n6. **Format the Path**: Format the recorded path in the desired output format, which according to your question is A->B->C (substitute A, B, C with actual node names).\n\nBased on the file content, here's a high-level pseudo-code representation of these steps:\n\n```pseudo\nfunction parseTree(file):\n    tree = {}\n    for line in file:\n        parent, child = line.split(\"->\")\n        if parent not in tree:\n            tree[parent] = []\n        tree[parent].append(child)\n    return tree\n\nfunction findPath(tree, start, end):\n    stack = [(start, [start])]\n    while stack:\n        node, path = stack.pop()\n        for child in tree.get(node, []):\n            if child == end:\n                return path + [child]\n            stack.append((child, path + [child]))\n    return []\n\nfileContent = [...]\ntree = parseTree(fileContent)\npath = findPath(tree, 'w', 'hd"
