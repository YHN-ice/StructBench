        "To answer the question \"What is the path from the root node to the node ce?\" using the provided file, you would need to parse the file and construct a tree-like structure (or a graph if there are cycles or non-hierarchical connections) to represent the relationships between nodes.\n\nHere's a simplified process to find the answer:\n\n1. **Parse the File**: Read the file line by line and parse each line to extract the parent-child relationships (e.g., \"z->ab\" means \"z\" is a parent of \"ab\").\n\n2. **Build the Tree/Graph**: Create a data structure to represent the nodes and their connections. For a tree, this may involve creating a `Node` class with references to its children. For a graph, you may use adjacency lists or matrices.\n\n3. **Search for the Path**: Perform a search (e.g., depth-first search or breadth-first search) starting from the root node (in this case \"z\") and continue until you reach the target node (\"ce\").\n\n4. **Record the Path**: As you search, keep track of the path from the root to the current node. When you reach the target node, you will have recorded the full path.\n\n5. **Format the Path**: Format the path according to the required output format (e.g., \"A->B->C\").\n\nGiven the format of the input file with relationships like \"parent->child\", you can start by building a dictionary in Python that maps each parent to its children. Then perform a search for the node \"ce\" while keeping track of the path.\n\nHere is an example in Python-like pseudocode:\n\n```python\n# Parse the file into a dictionary\ntree = {}\nfor line in file:\n    parent, child = line.split('->')\n    if parent not in tree:\n        tree[parent] = []\n    tree[parent].append(child)\n\n# Function to find the path from root to target node\ndef find_path(tree, current, target, path):\n    if current == target:\n        return path\n    if current not in tree:\n        return None\n    for child in tree[current]:\n        result = find_path(tree, child, target, path + [child])\n        if result is not None:\n            return result\n    return None\n\n# Find and format the path from 'z' to 'ce'\npath_to_ce = find_path(tree, 'z', 'ce', ['z'])\nformatted_path = '->"
