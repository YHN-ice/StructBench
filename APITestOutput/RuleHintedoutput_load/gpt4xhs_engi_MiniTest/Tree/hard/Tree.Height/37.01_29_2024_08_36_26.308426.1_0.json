        "To answer the question about the height of the root node from the given file, we need to interpret it as a representation of a tree structure and find the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. Each line in the file represents an edge from a parent node to a child node, with the format `parent->child`. \n\nHere are the steps you would follow to find the height of the root node:\n\n1. **Parse the Tree Structure**: Read each line of the file and build a tree data structure from it. This typically involves creating nodes and edges in a way that reflects parent-child relationships.\n\n2. **Identify the Root Node**: The root node is the one that does not appear as a child in any line (meaning it has no parents). In this case, it is the node 'w', as it is only mentioned at the left side of an \"->\" and never at the right side.\n\n3. **Calculate Tree Height**: Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the root node to find the maximum depth, which is equivalent to the height. Keep track of the depth as you traverse, and update the maximum depth whenever you reach a leaf node (a node with no children).\n\n4. **Return the Maximum Depth**: Once you've searched all paths from the root to the leaves, the maximum depth you've encountered is the height of the root node.\n\nFor the given tree structure in the file, this process will reveal that the height of the root node 'w' is 7, as stated in the answer. This is because there is a path from 'w' down to 'qk' that involves 7 edges (the longest path), making it the longest path from 'w' to any leaf node. \n\nFor example, one of such paths would be:\nw->uf->vf->wf->mg->ng->rg->tg\n\nThe count of edges in this path is 7, which indeed tallies with the given answer."
