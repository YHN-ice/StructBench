        "To answer the question about the height of the root node in the given tree structure represented by the file, one must understand the tree's hierarchical structure, which is described by parent->child relationships, such as \"z->ab\" meaning \"z\" is a parent of \"ab\".\n\nHere's how you can determine the height of the root node:\n\n1. Construct a tree representation from the file: Parse the file and build a tree data structure that captures the parent-child relationships.\n\n2. Identify the root node: In this file, \"z\" appears to be the root node since it is on the left side of \"->\" and not on any right side, indicating it has no parents.\n\n3. Calculate heights recursively: Starting from the root node, recursively calculate the height of each node, where the height is defined as the maximum number of edges in the path from that node to any leaf node.\n\n4. Find the longest path: As you calculate heights, keep track of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.\n\nLet's walk through a simplified parsing and calculation process:\n\n- Start at the root node \"z\".\n- Look for all direct children of \"z\" (in this case, \"ab\" and \"xf\").\n- For each child, recursively repeat this process to find its children until reaching leaf nodes.\n- Count the number of edges along each path from \"z\" to leaf nodes.\n- The greatest number found is the height of the root node.\n\nBased on the input file, we can see that there are multiple branches stemming from the root \"z\". The longest path from \"z\" to a leaf node can be visually traced through the following edges: z->ab->bb->cb->db->eb->fb->gb. This path contains 7 edges, which means the height of the root node \"z\" is 7, as provided in the answer."
