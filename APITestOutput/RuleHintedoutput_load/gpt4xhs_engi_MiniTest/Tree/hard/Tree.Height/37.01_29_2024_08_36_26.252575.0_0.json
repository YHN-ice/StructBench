        "To answer the question about the height of the root node in the file provided, you would need to parse the file to build a representation of the tree and then find the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. The height of the root node is the number of edges in this longest path.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to finding the answer:\n\n1. Parse the file: Read each line and interpret it as an edge in the tree. Each line has the format `parent->child`, indicating a relationship between two nodes.\n\n2. Build the tree structure: Create a data structure (e.g., an adjacency list or a dictionary) to represent the tree, where keys are parent nodes and values are lists of child nodes.\n\n3. Determine heights: For each node, calculate the height by recursively finding the maximum height of its children and adding one (since each connection to a child is an edge). A leaf node (a node without children) will have a height of 0.\n\n4. Find the height of the root node: Identify the root node (the node that is never a child in any of the lines) and determine its height using the method described in step 3.\n\nHere's a high-level example in Python-like pseudocode:\n\n```python\ntree = defaultdict(list)\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Parse file and build tree\nfor line in file:\n    parent, child = line.split(\"->\")\n    tree[parent].append(child)\n\n# Function to compute height of a node\ndef get_height(node):\n    if node not in tree or not tree[node]:\n        return 0\n    return 1 + max(get_height(child) for child in tree[node])\n\n# Step 4: Find root node and its height\nroot = find_root_node(tree)  # This function would determine the root node\nroot_height = get_height(root)\n\nprint(root_height)\n```\n\nThis code assumes that there is a `find_root_node` function to identify the root node. In this case, you would be looking for a node that doesn't appear as a child anywhere in the file.\n\nGiven that your answer is `7`, it implies that in your hierarchical tree data from the file, the longest path from root to any leaf consists of 7 edges, making the height of the root node 7."
