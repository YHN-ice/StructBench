        "To answer the question about the height of the root node in the given file, we need to parse the tree structure outlined by the file's contents and calculate the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. Here's a step-by-step process to find the answer:\n\n1. **Parse the File**: Read each line of the file and interpret it as a directed edge from one node to another, where `v->w` means there is an edge from node `v` to node `w`. The left side of `->` is the parent node and the right side is the child node.\n\n2. **Construct the Tree**: Create a data structure to represent the tree. This could be done using a dictionary (in languages like Python) or a map (in languages like C++ or Java), where keys are parent nodes and values are lists of child nodes.\n\n3. **Determine Root Node**: The root node is typically the one that does not appear as a child node on the right side of any line. In our case, we can assume the node `v` to be the root as it appears on the left side of the very first line and doesn't seem to be a child anywhere else.\n\n4. **Calculate Height**: Traverse the tree starting from the root node and calculate the depth (height) of each node recursively. The height of a leaf node (a node with no children) is 0. The height of a non-leaf node is 1 plus the maximum height of its children.\n\n5. **Output Answer**: After traversing the tree and calculating heights, output the height of the root node, which represents the number of edges in the longest path from the root to any leaf.\n\nTo implement this algorithm, you can use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and calculate heights. Here's some pseudocode for clarity:\n\n```pseudo\nfunction constructTree(file):\n    tree = {}\n    for each line in file:\n        parent, child = parseLine(line)\n        if parent not in tree:\n            tree[parent] = []\n        tree[parent].append(child)\n    return tree\n\nfunction getHeight(tree, node):\n    if node not in tree:  # It's a leaf\n        return 0\n    heights = []\n    for child in tree[node]:\n        heights.append(getHeight(tree, child))\n    return 1 + max(heights)\n\nfile = readInputFile()\ntree = constructTree(file)\nroot_height = getHeight"
