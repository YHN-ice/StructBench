        "To answer the question \"What is the depth of node nk?\" using the provided file, you would need to parse the tree structure defined by the \"->\" relationships in the file. The depth of a node in a tree is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.

Start at the root node \"w\" and create a data structure to represent the tree, such as an adjacency list or a dictionary where keys are parent nodes and values are lists of child nodes.\n\n2.
