        "To answer the question \"What is the depth of node vh?\" from the given file, we need to parse the tree structure defined by the relationships in the file. Each line of the file represents an edge in a directed graph (or tree), with the structure `parent_node->child_node`.\n\nThe root of this tree is node 'x', as it appears first on the left side and does not appear as a child on the right side of any arrow ('->'). Given that the root is of depth 0, we need to find the depth of node 'vh' by tracing the path from the root to 'vh', counting the number of edges on that path.\n\nHere's how you can manually find the depth of node 'vh' by following its ancestral path:\n\n1. Start at node 'x' (depth 0).\n2. Follow down the tree to find the parent of 'vh', which is 'uh' (increment depth by 1 with each step).\n3. Then find the parent of 'uh', which is 'th' (depth increases).\n4. Continue tracing back up the tree until you reach the root, counting the number of steps.\n\nBased on the lines in the file that define these relationships, we can see that:\n\n- x->vf (depth 1)\n- vf->wf (depth 2)\n- wf->ch (depth 3)\n- ch->sh (depth 4)\n- sh->th (depth 5)\n- th->uh (depth 6)\n- uh->vh (depth 7)\n\nFollowing these connections, we find that node 'vh' is at a depth of 7 from the root node 'x'.
