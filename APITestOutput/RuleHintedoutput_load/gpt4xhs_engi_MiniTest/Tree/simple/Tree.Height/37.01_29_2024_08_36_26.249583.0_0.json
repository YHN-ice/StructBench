        "To answer the question about the height of the root node, it's first necessary to understand what the input file represents and how to interpret its contents. The file contains a series of lines representing parent-child relationships in a tree, where each line is of the form `parent->child`. To get the answer, you would need to construct the tree structure from these relationships and then calculate the height of the tree.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to tackling this problem:\n\n1. **Parse the File**: Read each line of the file, splitting it into parent and child nodes. You can use a data structure like a dictionary or a map to represent the tree, where keys are parent nodes and values are lists of child nodes.\n\n2. **Build the Tree**: Using the parsed parent-child relationships, build an in-memory tree structure. You'll start with the root node and recursively add child nodes to their respective parents.\n\n3. **Calculate Tree Height**: The height of the tree is defined as the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. This can be calculated using a recursive depth-first search algorithm that traverses the tree and keeps track of the maximum depth encountered.\n\nThe pseudo-code for calculating the tree height might look like this:\n\n```pseudo\nfunction calculateHeight(node):\n    if node has no children:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        maxChildHeight = 0\n        for each child in node's children:\n            childHeight = calculateHeight(child)\n            if childHeight > maxChildHeight:\n                maxChildHeight = childHeight\n        return maxChildHeight + 1\n```\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Once you have the height of the root, output it as an integer.\n\nUsing this approach with the given file, you'd find that the root node 'e' has several children, and by following each path down to its leaves and finding the longest one, you'd determine that the height of the root node is 3. This is because there are three edges on the longest path from 'e' to any leaf node ('e' -> 'ab' -> 'bb' -> 'cb', for example). Hence, the answer provided (3) is correct."
