        "The given input file appears to represent a tree structure using a simple parent->child notation on each line, where each line of the file specifies a direct relationship between two nodes in the tree.\n\nTo determine the height of the root node, we need to:\n\n1.

Traverse the tree from the root node to find the longest path to any leaf node.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Parse the Tree**\n- Create a data structure (like a dictionary) to represent the tree. The keys could be the parent nodes, and the values would be lists of their children.\n- Read the file line by line, splitting each line by '->' to separate parent and child nodes.\n- Add each child to the list of children for its corresponding parent in the tree structure.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Height**\n- Start from the root node ('t' in this case, as it appears to be the topmost node with no parent).\n- Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find the maximum depth. For each node:\n  - If it has no children (it's a leaf), return 0 (height of leaf is 0).\n  - If it has children, recursively calculate the height of each subtree originating from those children, add 1 (for the current edge), and return the maximum of those heights.\n\n**Step 3: Output the Result**\n- The result from step 2 is the height of the root, which you would output or return depending on your implementation.\n\nHere's some pseudocode to illustrate how you might implement this:\n\n```pseudocode\nfunction parseTree(file):\n    tree = {}\n    for line in file:\n        parent, child = line.strip().split('->')\n        if parent not in tree:\n            tree[parent] = []\n        tree[parent].append(child)\n    return tree\n\nfunction findHeight(tree, node):\n    if node not in tree:  # It's a leaf\n        return 0\n    else:  # It's an internal node\n        heights = []\n        for child in tree[node]:\n            heights.append(findHeight(tree, child))\n        return max(heights) + 1\n\nfileLines = [...file content...]\ntree = parseTree(fileLines)\nrootHeight = findHeight(tree, 't')\nprint(rootHeight)\n```\n\nRegarding the answer provided (\"3"
