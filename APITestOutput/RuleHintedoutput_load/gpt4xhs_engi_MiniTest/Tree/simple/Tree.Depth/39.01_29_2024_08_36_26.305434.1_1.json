        "To answer the question \"What is the depth of the node qc?\" using the given file, you need to parse the file to build a representation of the tree structure it describes and then find the depth of the specific node in question. Here's a step-by-step method to achieve this:\n\n1. **Read the File**: Begin by reading the file line by line. Each line represents an edge in the tree, with a '->' symbol indicating a parent-child relationship between two nodes.\n\n2. **Create a Tree Structure**: As you read the file, build a tree structure by creating nodes for each unique identifier and connecting them according to the parent-child relationships indicated. You may use a data structure like a dictionary or a map where the key is the node identifier, and the value is a list of its children.\n\n3. **Calculate Depth**: Once the tree structure is built, you can calculate the depth of any node by starting from the root node (in this case, 'v' seems to be the root as it appears to have no parent) and traversing down the tree until you find the target node ('qc'). The number of edges you traverse will be the depth of that node.\n\n4. **Output the Answer**: When you reach the target node, the depth value accumulated during traversal is your answer.\n\nConsidering the structure provided in the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Start at node 'v' (depth 0).\n- Move to its child 'mc' (depth 1).\n- Then move to 'mc's child 'nc' (depth 2).\n- Finally, move to 'nc's child 'qc' (depth 3).\n\nTherefore, the depth of node 'qc' is 3, which matches the given answer.\n\nThis general approach assumes that the tree doesn't have any cycles and that there is a single unique path from the root to any node. If cycles exist or nodes can be reached through multiple paths, additional logic to handle these cases would be required. Additionally, if the file is very large or has complexities not indicated in your question, you may need to consider more sophisticated methods for parsing and searching within the tree."
