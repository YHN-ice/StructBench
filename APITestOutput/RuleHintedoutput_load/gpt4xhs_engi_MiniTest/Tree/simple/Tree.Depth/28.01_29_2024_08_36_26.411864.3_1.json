        "The input file seems to be representing a hierarchical tree structure where each line denotes a parent-child relationship in the form of `parent->child`.

Start at the root node, which is 'h' in this case. This node is at depth 0.\n2. Follow the lines of the file to find the path that leads to 'wc'.
