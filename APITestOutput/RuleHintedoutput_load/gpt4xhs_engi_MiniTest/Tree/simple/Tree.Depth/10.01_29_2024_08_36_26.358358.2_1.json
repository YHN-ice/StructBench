        "To answer the question \"What is the depth of node mc?\" from the given file format, you need to understand the tree structure represented by the file. The file appears to contain parent-child relationships in a tree, with each line representing an edge from a parent node to a child node, using the syntax `parent->child`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to find the depth of a specific node (in this case, 'mc'):\n\n1. Start by determining the root node(s), which in this case is 't' because it does not appear as a child node to any other node and is at the beginning of other node relationships.\n\n2. Create a representation of the tree structure based on the file. You can use a data structure such as a dictionary or a map where each key is a parent node and the associated value is a list of child nodes.\n\n3. Traverse the tree starting from the root node, keeping track of the current depth as you move from parent to child nodes. You could use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) for this process.\n\n4. Once you find the target node ('mc'), you return the current depth at which you found it.\n\nIn the given file, we can find the following path to 'mc':\n\n```\nt (depth 0)\n└-> kc (depth 1)\n   └-> lc (depth 2)\n      └-> mc (depth 3)\n```\n\nThus, the depth of the node 'mc' is 3, which is your answer.\n\nRegarding potential difficulties and obstacles mentioned earlier, they might not all apply directly to this problem if the input format is consistent and well-defined, but they are important to consider when building a more general tree parsing solution."
