Understanding the hierarchy and relationships between elements is crucial to extract correct information.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: While YAML aims to be human-friendly, inconsistencies in indentation or formatting can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the data structure.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors for repeating content. This feature can complicate parsing if not handled correctly, as it requires the parser to properly substitute references with the actual content.\n\n4. **Data Types**: YAML automatically tries to determine data types, which can sometimes lead to unexpected types if the data is not formatted correctly (e.g., interpreting a string as a boolean). Ensuring that data types are correctly interpreted is essential.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: Handling special characters, such as colons in strings, requires careful attention, as these might affect the parsing if not properly quoted or escaped.\n\n6. **Comments**: YAML allows comments, which should be ignored by the parser. Ensuring that comments are not mistakenly treated as data is important.\n\n7. **Extensibility**: Custom tags and types can be defined in YAML, which might require additional logic in the parser to handle them adequately.\n\n8. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it may pose performance issues or consume excessive memory when parsing.\n\n9. **Version Differences**: There are different versions of the YAML specification (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 1.2), and some features or behaviors might differ between versions.
