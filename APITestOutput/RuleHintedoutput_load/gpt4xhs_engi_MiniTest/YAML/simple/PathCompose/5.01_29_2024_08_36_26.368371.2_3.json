        "To answer the question \"How to access value 'm'?\" with the given file content, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Root Object**: Recognize that the file content represents a YAML formatted object. In this case, the root object is implied and represented by the entire content of the file.\n\n2. **Parse the YAML Content**: Either use a YAML parser to convert the content into a data structure or understand the YAML structure manually. Since it's a simple structure, I'll explain it without using an actual parser.\n\n3. **Navigate Through the Data Structure**: Follow the structure as indicated by the question to find the key or index that leads to the desired value 'm'.\n\n4. **Understand the Hierarchy**: The hierarchy starts with `subs`, which is a list (indicated by `-`). Within this list, we need to access the first item (index 0). Inside this item, we're looking for the key `Y` which contains the value 'm'.\n\nHere's how you would navigate through the data structure:\n\n- Start at the root object (which we'll refer to as `obj`).\n- Access the `subs` key, which contains a list: `obj[\"subs\"]`.\n- In this list, access the first item (since lists are zero-indexed, this is index 0): `obj[\"subs\"][0]`.\n- Within this first item, which is a dictionary, access the key `Y` to find the value 'm': `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]`.\n\nThe full expression to access value 'm' is `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]`.\n\nThis expression assumes that you've loaded the YAML content into an object named `obj`. If using a YAML parser in a programming language like Python, you would use a library such as PyYAML to load the file into a dictionary-like object before accessing it using this expression.\n\nPlease note that if you are manually parsing this without a programming language and just following the structure logically, then you can deduce that \"m\" is accessed by following the path directly as described."
