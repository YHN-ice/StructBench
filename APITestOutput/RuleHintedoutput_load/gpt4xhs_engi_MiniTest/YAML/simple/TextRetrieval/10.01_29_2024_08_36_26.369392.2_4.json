        "To answer the given question, \"What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?\" from the provided YAML file content, we need to examine the hierarchy of objects in the YAML data and identify the ones that are not followed by any further nested lists or dictionaries.\n\nThe provided YAML content:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"f\"\nZ: n,\nsubs: \n- id: \"g\"\n  Y: m,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"h\"\n    X: l,\n    subs: []\n```\n\nThis YAML represents a structure where each object can contain an `id`, some other keys (like `Z`, `Y`, `X`), and a `subs` list which is used for nesting. We look for the object with an empty `subs` list, as it suggests that there are no more nested lists or dictionaries beneath it.\n\nThe most deeply nested object is:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"h\"\nX: l,\nsubs: []\n```\n\nThis object is at the deepest level because the `subs` list is empty, indicating that there are no further nested structures. It maintains the original formatting and indentation as it appears in the provided YAML content. The answer extracted from the file should maintain the relevant YAML structure and be presented in a way that reflects its original format.\n\nWhen extracting such information from a YAML file, you would typically use a programming language with a YAML parsing library. In Python, for example, you might use the `PyYAML` library to load the YAML content and then traverse the data structure to find objects that meet the criteria.\n\nHere's how you might do it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\n# Simulate reading from a file\nyaml_content = \"\"\"\nid: \"f\"\nZ: n,\nsubs: \n- id: \"g\"\n  Y: m,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"h\"\n    X: l,\n    subs: []\n\"\"\"\n\n# Parse the YAML content\ndata = yaml.safe_load(yaml_content)\n\n# Function to recursively find the most deeply nested objects\ndef find_deepest_objects(data, deepest_objects):\n    if isinstance(data, list):\n        for item in data:\n            find_deepest_objects(item, deepest_objects)\n    elif isinstance(data, dict):\n        if not data.get('subs'):  # Check if 'subs' is an empty list\n            deepest_objects.append(data)\n        else:\n            find"
