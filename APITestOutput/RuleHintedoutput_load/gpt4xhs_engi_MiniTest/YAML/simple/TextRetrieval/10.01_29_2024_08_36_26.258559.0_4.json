        "To answer the question about the most deeply nested objects which have no list or dict as a value, we need to manually examine the structure provided in the input YAML content. The YAML content describes a hierarchy of objects with `id`, `X`, `Y`, `Z` keys and a `subs` key indicating sub-elements.\n\nFrom the given YAML fragment:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"e\"\nZ: j,\nsubs: \n- id: \"f\"\n  Y: i,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"g\"\n    X: h,\n    subs: []\n```\n\nWe can see that there is an object hierarchy `e -> f -> g`. The deepest level here is the object with `id: \"g\"`, which has an `X` value and an empty `subs` list. This object (`id: \"g\"`) is the most deeply nested object that contains no list or dict as a value (since `subs` is empty).\n\nHence, the answer would be the following excerpt from the YAML file:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"g\"\nX: h,\nsubs: []\n```"
