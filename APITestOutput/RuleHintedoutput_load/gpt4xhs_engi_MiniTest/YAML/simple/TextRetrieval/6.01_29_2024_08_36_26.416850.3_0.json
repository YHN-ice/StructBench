Confusion between similar-looking keys or handling of case sensitivity can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Indentation**: YAML relies on indentation to delineate structure.

        "To get the answer from the file provided as input for the question \"What is the object with id c?\", you would need to parse the YAML content and search for the element with the specified id value of \"c\". The content should be returned exactly as it appears in the YAML file. Here's how you could approach it:\n\n1. **Parse the YAML File**: Use a YAML parser in your programming language of choice (such as PyYAML in Python). Ensure that you handle errors in case of invalid YAML syntax.\n\n2. **Search for the Object with ID \"c\"**: After parsing, you will get a data structure that represents the content of the YAML file. You need to recursively search through this data structure, looking for a dictionary or map entry with an `id` key with the value \"c\".\n\n3. **Extract and Format the Answer**: Once you find the object with `id: \"c\"`, format the output to match the YAML syntax as it appears in the file. This includes maintaining proper indentation, key order, and data types.\n\nGiven the file provided as input, parsing it would result in a data structure similar to this (in Python-like pseudocode):\n\n```python\n{\n    \"id\": \"b\",\n    \"Z\": \"w\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"c\",\n            \"Y\": \"v\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"d\",\n                    \"X\": \"u\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nTo extract the object with `id: \"c\"` and display it as it appears in the YAML file, the output would be:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"c\"\nY: v,\nsubs: \n- id: \"d\"\n  X: u,\n  subs: []\n```\n\nThis is the answer to the question based on the input provided.
