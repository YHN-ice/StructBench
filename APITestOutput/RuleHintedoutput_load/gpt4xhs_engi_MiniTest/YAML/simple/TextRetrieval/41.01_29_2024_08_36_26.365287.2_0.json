        "To retrieve the answer from the file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Question**: Determine what you are looking for in the YAML file. In this case, you need to find the object with the id \"h\".\n\n2. **Parse the YAML File**: Use a YAML parser that can read the file's content and create a data structure that represents it, such as a nested dictionary or list in Python.\n\n3. **Navigate the Data Structure**: Traverse through the parsed data structure to find the element with the specified id \"h\". Since the YAML content provided shows nested structures under the key `subs`, you would typically drill down through these lists, checking each dictionary if it has an `id` key with the value \"h\".\n\n4. **Extract Relevant Information**: Once you have located the correct item, retrieve the information related to that object. In this case, you would extract the entire block of the item with id \"h\".\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: Format the extracted information in a way that matches how it appears in the YAML file (preserving indentation, keys, values, etc.).\n\nHere's how you might do this in Python using a popular library called PyYAML:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\n# Sample YAML content as a string\nyaml_content = \"\"\"\nid: \"f\"\nZ: n,\nsubs: \n- id: \"g\"\n  Y: m,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"h\"\n    X: l,\n    subs: []\n\"\"\"\n\n# Parse the YAML content\ndata = yaml.safe_load(yaml_content)\n\n# Function to recursively search for an object by id\ndef find_object_by_id(obj, target_id):\n    if isinstance(obj, dict):\n        if obj.get('id') == target_id:\n            return obj\n        for sub_obj in obj.get('subs', []):\n            found = find_object_by_id(sub_obj, target_id)\n            if found:\n                return found\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        for item in obj:\n            found = find_object_by_id(item, target_id)\n            if found:\n                return found\n    return None\n\n# Search for the object with id 'h'\nobject_with_id_h = find_object_by_id(data, 'h')\n\n# Print the result\nif object_with_id_h:\n    print(yaml.dump(object_with_id_h))\nelse:\n    print(\"Object with id 'h' not found.\")\n```\n\nThis script would output"
