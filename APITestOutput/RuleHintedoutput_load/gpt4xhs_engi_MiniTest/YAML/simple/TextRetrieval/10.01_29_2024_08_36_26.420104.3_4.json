        "Given the question \"What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?\" and the provided YAML content, we must identify the entries within the YAML structure that do not contain further lists or dictionaries as values. This means we're looking for leaf nodes in our hierarchical data structure. In the provided YAML content, we see that there is a nested structure with \"subs\" indicating further lists of objects.\n\nTo find the most deeply nested objects, we can examine each level and ensure that there are no further \"subs\" (lists) present. The provided YAML content is already structured hierarchically, and we can follow the nesting to find the deepest objects.\n\nHere's the provided YAML file content:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"b\"\nZ: w,\nsubs: \n- id: \"c\"\n  Y: v,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"d\"\n    X: u,\n    subs: []\n```\n\nUpon inspection, we can see that the object with `id: \"d\"` is the most deeply nested object, as its \"subs\" list is empty, indicating no further nesting. Consequently, the excerpt from the YAML file that represents this object, as it appears in the file, is:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"d\"\nX: u,\nsubs: []\n```\n\nThis represents a single object with no further nested list or dictionary. Please note that in YAML, typically commas are not used as in JSON. They appear here possibly due to a syntax error or a special format requirement of the file.\n\nIn conclusion, to answer the question directly:\n\n```\nid: \"d\"\nX: u,\nsubs: []\n```"
