        "To answer the question about the most deeply nested objects in the YAML file that do not have sub-elements of type list or dict, we need to inspect the provided YAML content. We'll look for objects that contain an `id` and other attributes but have an empty `subs` list since `subs` appears to be the key where nested lists or dictionaries could be present.\n\nBased on the YAML content given, we can see that there are several objects that satisfy this condition. They have an empty `subs` list (`subs: []`) and are the deepest level because they are not containing any further nested lists or dictionaries. These objects are represented by the IDs \"d\", \"e\", \"g\", \"h\", \"k\", \"l\", \"n\", and \"o\".\n\nHere are the excerpts from the YAML file for these objects:\n\n```\n- id: \"d\"\n  V: xy,\n  U: wy,\n  subs: []\n- id: \"e\"\n  T: vy,\n  S: uy,\n  subs: []\n- id: \"g\"\n  P: ry,\n  O: qy,\n  subs: []\n- id: \"h\"\n  N: py,\n  M: oy,\n  subs: []\n- id: \"k\"\n  H: jy,\n  G: iy,\n  subs: []\n- id: \"l\"\n  F: hy,\n  subs: []\n- id: \"n\"\n  D: fy,\n  subs: []\n- id: \"o\"\n  C: ey,\n  subs: []\n```\n\nThe answer would be to provide these excerpts separated by two newlines (as per the instruction):\n\n```\nid: \"d\"\nV: xy,\nU: wy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"e\"\nT: vy,\nS: uy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"g\"\nP: ry,\nO: qy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"h\"\nN: py,\nM: oy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"k\"\nH: jy,\nG: iy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"l\"\nF: hy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"n\"\nD: fy,\nsubs: []\n\nid: \"o\"\nC: ey,\nsubs: []\n```\n\nThese excerpts should be in the exact order and format as they appear in the original YAML file, and you would remove the list dash `-` before each `id` to match the answer format provided"
