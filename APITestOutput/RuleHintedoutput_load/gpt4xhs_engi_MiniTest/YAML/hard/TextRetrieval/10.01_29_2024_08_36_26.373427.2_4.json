        "To answer the question regarding the most deeply nested objects in the YAML file, which are objects with no lists or dicts as values, you will need to:\n\n1. Parse the YAML contents to understand the hierarchical structure of the document.\n2. Traverse the parsed structure to identify objects at the deepest nesting level.\n3. Filter out any objects that contain lists or dictionaries as values.\n4. Extract the relevant properties of these deeply nested objects.\n\nBased on the given YAML content, you have to traverse the `subs` lists and identify objects that have empty `subs` lists themselves. These will be your most deeply nested objects.\n\nHere's what you would do:\n\n- Start from the root object (id: \"o\").\n- Go down each level of `subs` checking for further nested `subs`.\n- When you reach an object with an empty `subs` list (`subs: []`), you've found a deeply nested object.\n\nAccording to the provided YAML content, the most deeply nested objects are those with ids \"r\", \"s\", \"u\", \"v\", \"y\", \"z\", \"bb\", and \"cb\".
