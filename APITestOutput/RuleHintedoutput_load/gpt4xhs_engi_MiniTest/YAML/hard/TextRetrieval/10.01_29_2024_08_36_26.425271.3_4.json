        "To get the answer from the given YAML file, you need to parse through the file and look for objects that contain no further nested list (`subs`) or dictionary as their values. The question asks for the objects that are most deeply nested, which means that they have no further nesting within them.\n\nThe content of the YAML file shows a hierarchical structure where each 'id' has a set of attributes and a 'subs' list which might contain further nested objects. The answer consists of the objects whose 'subs' list is empty (`subs: []`), indicating that they are the most deeply nested objects with no further nesting.\n\nHere's how you would extract the answer step by step:\n\n1.
