Some potential difficulties and obstacles include:\n\n1. **Complex Formatting**: LaTeX documents can have complex formatting commands that can affect how text is displayed or interpreted. As a parser, distinguishing between actual content and formatting commands is crucial.\n\n2. **Commands and Macros**: LaTeX allows users to define their own commands and macros. Without knowing what these custom commands do, it might be difficult to extract the intended textual content.\n\n3. **Mathematical Expressions**: If the LaTeX file contains mathematical expressions, these are generally written in a syntax that is meant for typesetting rather than for easy interpretation by a parser not specifically designed for mathematical content.\n\n4. **Environment Dependencies**: LaTeX documents often contain various environments (like `itemize`, `enumerate`, `figure`, `table`, etc.) that structure the content. Understanding the start and end of these environments is important to contextualize the information.\n\n5. **Cross-Referencing**: LaTeX allows for labeling sections, figures, and equations, and then referencing them throughout the document. Resolving these references to their intended targets could be complicated without processing the entire document.\n\n6. **Conditional Compilation**: Sometimes LaTeX documents include conditional compilation options which display different content based on certain conditions or flags. This could affect the parser's ability to extract the intended content accurately.\n\n7. **External Dependencies**: A LaTeX file may depend on external files (like images or bibliography databases) or packages that are not included within the file itself, which could make it difficult to fully render or understand the document without these resources.\n\n8. **Encoding and Special Characters**: Special characters and encoding in LaTeX may not map directly to their visual representation, so understanding how to properly decode these entities is necessary.\n\n9. **Comments and Non-printed Material**: LaTeX allows for comments that are not printed in the final document. Distinguishing between content meant to be displayed and comments meant for authors or editors can be challenging.\n\n10. **Nested Structures**: The hierarchical nature of LaTeX commands (like nested lists or tables within tables) can pose a challenge for parsing and extracting information correctly.\n\n11. **Document Class and Styling**: The behavior of certain commands and environments can change depending on the document class or style files used, which might affect how content should be interpreted.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, one would need to implement a robust parsing strategy that can handle LaTeX's syntax and structure while retaining the"
