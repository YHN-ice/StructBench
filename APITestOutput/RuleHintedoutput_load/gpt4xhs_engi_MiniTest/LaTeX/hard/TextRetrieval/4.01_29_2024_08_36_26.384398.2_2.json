This can affect which parts of the document are actually relevant or visible in the final output.\n\n5. **Handling Packages**: Many LaTeX documents rely on external packages, which can introduce additional commands and environments. To fully understand such a document, one would need to know how these packages modify the document.\n\n6. **Cross-referencing**: LaTeX allows for cross-referencing elements such as figures, tables, and sections. Ensuring that references match up with their targets is essential for context and accuracy.\n\n7. **Math Modes**: Special attention is needed for math modes, as they have different parsing rules and symbols than regular text.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: Character encoding must be handled correctly, especially for non-ASCII characters.\n\n9. **Comments and Whitespaces**: Comments (anything after '%') and whitespaces may or may not be relevant to the content, depending on the context of the question.\n\n10. **Statefulness**: The LaTeX processing model is stateful; for instance, commands can change the style or introduce variables that affect subsequent parts of the document.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser must have a robust understanding of LaTeX syntax and semantics, possibly using a formal grammar or a LaTeX-aware parsing library.
