The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can contain other Markdown elements like links, images, or italic text. The parser must extract the bold text without including the syntax of the nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows characters like asterisks to be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting. For example, `\\**not bold**` should not be treated as bold.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: There can be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed, such as `**bold text`. The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Multiple Bold Sections on the Same Line**: A single line may contain multiple bold sections separated by other text. The parser must identify and extract all these sections.\n\n6. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (using backticks `) should not be interpreted as bold, even if it contains the bold syntax.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Similar to inline code blocks, text within code blocks or fenced code blocks (indicated by indenting or triple backticks/backquotes) should not be interpreted as bold.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is large, there may be performance considerations to account for when parsing the file.\n\n9. **Edge Cases and Ambiguities**: There may be edge cases or ambiguities in the input Markdown file that are not covered by standard Markdown rules, which could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\nTo address these difficulties, the parser should have a robust algorithm capable of handling different Markdown constructs while focusing specifically on extracting bold text without any formatting syntax."
