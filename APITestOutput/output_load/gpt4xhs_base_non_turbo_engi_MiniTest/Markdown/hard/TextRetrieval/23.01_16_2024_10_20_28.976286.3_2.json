The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but variations can include omitting the title, alt text, or both. Additionally, references to images might be included rather than direct URLs.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths:** Images might be referenced using relative paths (e.g., `./images/picture.jpg`) or absolute paths (e.g., `https://example.com/image.jpg`). The parser has to handle both cases.\n\n3. **Inline HTML:** Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML tags like `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"description\" />`. The parser should recognize these as well.\n\n4. **Linked Images:** Sometimes, images are links themselves, which means the image syntax is nested within link syntax, adding complexity to the parsing.\n\n5. **Non-Standard Markdown Extensions:** Certain flavors of Markdown allow for non-standard extensions that could change how images are included.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters:** Markdown allows escaping of characters, so a sequence that looks like an image reference might actually be a literal string instead of an image.\n\n7. **Distracting Similar Patterns:** There might be patterns in the text that look similar to image syntax but aren't, such as links without the exclamation mark or code blocks containing example image syntax.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line:** Sometimes, multiple images might be placed on a single line, and the parser should be able to handle and extract each one separately.\n\nFor a robust solution, the Markdown file parser has to account for these potential issues and be able to extract all image references accurately regardless of the format they are presented in."
