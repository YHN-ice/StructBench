When parsing a Markdown file to extract image files, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Variations in Markdown syntax for images**: Markdown can include images using different syntaxes, such as `![alt text](image-path)` or HTML-style tags like `<img src=\"image-path\" alt=\"alt text\" />`. We need to handle all possible variations to extract all image files.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using relative paths (e.g., `./images/pic.jpg`) or absolute paths (e.g., `https://example.com/images/pic.jpg`). The parser should extract the file names correctly in each case.\n\n3. **Link References**: Markdown allows image links to be defined separately as a reference, which might be located elsewhere in the document. The parser must resolve these references to extract the correct image file names.\n\n4. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Sometimes, images are embedded directly into the Markdown using Base64 encoding. These are not separate image files, but they may be mistaken for them if the parser is not designed to differentiate.\n\n5. **False Positives**: The parser may encounter false positives, such as URLs or other text that looks like an image link but isn't.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Some image links might include escape characters (`\\`) to display literal characters that would otherwise be interpreted as Markdown syntax.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images may be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes, which could complicate parsing.\n\n8. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions that add additional ways to include images, which may not follow the standard Markdown syntax.\n\nFor accurate extraction, the parser needs to account for these situations and potentially others, depending on the Markdown file's content and the flavors of Markdown used."
