Handling these requires parsing the references separately.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Users may embed HTML tags within Markdown files. This includes `<img>` tags with `src` attributes which need to be located and parsed differently than traditional Markdown image syntax.\n\n4. **Relative and absolute paths**: Image paths can be relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs. The parser must be able to handle both and recognize which ones are actual files that could be located on disk.\n\n5. **URLs vs. file paths**: Some images may link to external URLs rather than local files. The parser must distinguish between URLs and file paths to only return actual file names.\n\n6. **Encoding and formatting issues**: File names may include spaces or special characters that are encoded (e.g., `%20` for space) or Markdown escape characters that need to be handled properly.\n\n7. **Non-image file links**: Not all links in a Markdown file are images; some may be links to other types of files or web pages. The parser needs to differentiate between these and image links.\n\n8. **False positives**: There may be text in the Markdown file that resembles image syntax but isn't an actual image link, such as commented-out lines or examples of Markdown syntax within code blocks.\n\n9. **Nested content**: Images might be nested inside other Markdown structures like lists, blockquotes, or tables, adding complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n10. **Multiple images on one line**: There might be lines with multiple images, and the parser has to identify and extract all of them separately.\n\nPlease provide the input file now, so I can proceed with extracting the image file names accordingly."
