A parser must be able to recognize all these patterns.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting within it, such as italic, strikethrough, or even inline code blocks. The parser should be capable of handling nested formatting without breaking the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users might escape the bold syntax markers (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means that the text should not be extracted as bold. The parser needs to differentiate between escaped and non-escaped syntax.\n\n4. **Incorrectly formatted text**: Sometimes users make mistakes in their Markdown, leading to incorrectly formatted text that might not be intended as bold but could be misinterpreted by a simple pattern search.\n\n5. **Inline vs block elements**: Bold text can be within a paragraph (inline) or part of a header or list (block elements). The parser should maintain the context of where the bold text is located.\n\n6. **Ambiguity with list markers**: In Markdown, asterisks are also used for list items (e.g., `* List item`). The parser should distinguish between list item markers and bold markers.\n\n7. **Code blocks and inline code**: Bold markers within code blocks or inline code should not be treated as bold text, as formatting is ignored in these sections. The parser must ignore bold syntax within code sections.\n\n8. **Links and images**: Bold syntax within the alt text of links or images may require special handling to ensure accurate extraction of bold text without including markup for links or images.\n\n9. **False positives**: Text that appears similar to bold syntax but isn't meant for formatting, like mathematical expressions or special domain-specific usage, may lead to false positives if not handled properly.\n\nIf you provide me with the input Markdown file, I can attempt to extract the bold texts considering these potential difficulties and obstacles."
