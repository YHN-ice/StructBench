There could also be additional content like images or links that may not be relevant to the text excerpt needed.\n\n5. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: There are different \"flavors\" of Markdown which might have slightly different syntax rules (e.g., GitHub Flavored Markdown, CommonMark). This could affect how the file is parsed.\n\n6. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might contain HTML tags that need to be considered or stripped out while parsing.\n\n7. **File Length and Complexity**: Large files with many sections and subsections could make it more difficult to navigate and extract the correct portion of text.\n\n8. **Non-Sequential Subsections**: The sections and subsections may not be sequentially numbered or might be labeled with titles instead of numbers, requiring interpretation of the structure.\n\nGiven these potential issues, a parser should be designed to handle these cases carefully to ensure accurate extraction.
