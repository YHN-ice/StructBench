Typically, double asterisks or underscores are used before and after the text to make it bold (e.g., `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`). The parser must correctly identify this syntax amidst other content.\n\n2. **Different Markdown Flavors**: There are different flavors of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and some of them may have slightly different rules for bold syntax. The parser must be configured to handle the specific flavor in use.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags like italics, blockquotes, or code blocks. The parser must be able to handle nested formatting without getting confused.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to display them literally rather than being used for formatting (e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`). The parser should not interpret escaped characters as formatting.\n\n5. **Incorrect Formatting**: Users might incorrectly format bold text (e.g., missing one asterisk in `**bold*`). The parser should ideally recognize these mistakes and handle them accordingly, either by ignoring or correcting them.\n\n6. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (denoted by backticks) should not be formatted, even if it contains what appears to be bold syntax. The parser should skip over code blocks.\n\n7. **Links and Images**: Links and images in Markdown may also contain asterisks or underscores. The parser needs to differentiate between these and actual bold formatting.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, these obstacles would guide the process of extracting the bold text accurately. However, since I can't access files, you would need to input the content of the Markdown file here so that I can demonstrate how to extract the bold texts."
