The most common one is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there could be variations or shortcuts used in different flavors of Markdown.\n\n2. **Reference-style images**: Instead of inline links, images might be included using reference-style links, where the URL is not immediately next to the alt text but instead defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files contain HTML tags. Images might be included using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Image paths can be either relative to the location of the Markdown file or absolute URLs to an external resource. I need to differentiate and extract only the file names, not the entire path or URL.\n\n5. **Linked images**: Images might be linked to webpages or other resources, so it's important not to confuse the URL of the image with the URL of a hyperlink.\n\n6. **Non-image files**: Links to non-image files (like `.pdf` or `.docx`) could be present and need to be filtered out if only image file names are required.\n\n7. **Escaped characters**: Some characters within the image syntax might be escaped, which can complicate the parsing process.\n\n8. **Inline code or code blocks**: Image-like syntax within inline code or code blocks should not be treated as actual images since they are not rendered as such.\n\nTo address these challenges, I'll need to have a clear understanding of the Markdown syntax being used and apply appropriate regular expressions or parsing logic to accurately identify and extract only the image file names."
