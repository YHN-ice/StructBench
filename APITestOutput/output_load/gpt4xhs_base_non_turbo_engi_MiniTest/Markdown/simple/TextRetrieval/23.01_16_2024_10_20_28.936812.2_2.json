The most common format is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there could be variations or mistakes in the Markdown that deviate from this format.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in a Markdown file could be linked using either relative or absolute paths. Care must be taken to identify and extract the correct filename regardless of the path type.\n\n3. **Links vs. Images**: Sometimes, regular links might be confused with image links if not parsed carefully. The key difference is the presence of an exclamation mark (`!`) before the square brackets for images.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown supports inline HTML, so some images might be embedded using `<img>` tags instead of the standard Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links and images, where the URL is not inline but provided elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Filenames or URLs might contain escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly to get the actual filename.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line, which means the parser needs to correctly identify and separate each one.\n\n8. **Non-standard Extensions or Formatting**: Some Markdown parsers extend the standard with additional syntax for things like image resizing or classes, which could complicate extraction.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images may be nested inside other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, potentially complicating the parsing logic.\n\nTo effectively extract image file names, a parser must handle all of these cases appropriately. Now you can provide me with the input file, and I'll proceed to extract the image filenames accordingly."
