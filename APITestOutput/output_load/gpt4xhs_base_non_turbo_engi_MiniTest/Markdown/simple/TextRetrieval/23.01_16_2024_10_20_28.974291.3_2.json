Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract image file names from a Markdown file:\n\n1. **Syntax Variations**: Markdown syntax for images can vary. The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there can be variations, such as additional attributes or reference-style links.\n\n2. **Reference-Style Links**: Markdown allows for reference-style image links, where the URL of the image is not included directly with the image syntax but is defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Text that looks like an image link but isn't intended to be one (e.g., example text or commented-out content) could lead to false positives.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain raw HTML, including `<img>` tags. These would need to be recognized and parsed separately from Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Image Files in Code Blocks**: Image links within code blocks should not be treated as included images since these are meant to show examples of code, not to display actual images.\n\n6. **Linked Files vs. Embedded Images**: Distinguishing between linked files that are not images and actual embedded image files. Only image files should be extracted.\n\n7. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be referenced with relative or absolute paths, and the parser needs to handle both.\n\n8. **Non-Standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors might have extensions or additional syntax for including images or media that could complicate extraction.\n\n9. **File Path Complexity**: Some images might have complex file paths, including directories and subdirectories, or use URL parameters.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, these potential challenges can guide the approach to accurately extract all included image file names."
