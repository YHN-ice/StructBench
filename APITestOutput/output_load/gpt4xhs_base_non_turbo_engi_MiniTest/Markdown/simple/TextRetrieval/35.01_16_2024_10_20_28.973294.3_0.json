Care must be taken to parse the bold text accurately without including surrounding formatting characters or markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Incomplete Syntax**: There might be instances where the bold syntax is started but not correctly closed, leading to only part of the text being bold, or none at all.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Users might have escaped the markdown syntax for bold using a backslash `\\**not bold\\**`, which should not be treated as bold text.\n\n5. **Literal Asterisks in Text**: Asterisks are sometimes used in text literally rather than as formatting indicators, such as in mathematical expressions or to denote footnotes. These should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n6. **Inline Code Blocks**: Bold text within inline code blocks (wrapped in backticks `) should not be parsed as bold since markdown syntax is not processed inside code blocks.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text**: If there's bold text that spans multiple lines, it may need special handling to ensure it is correctly extracted as markdown does not traditionally support multiline syntax without additional spaces or breaks.\n\n8. **Lists and Nested Lists**: Bold text within lists or nested lists might need special attention to ensure the correct extraction without list markers.\n\nThese are some of the potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise when attempting to extract all bold texts from a Markdown file.
