Handling both of these cases will be necessary.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, links, or strikethroughs. Parsing the bold text while ignoring or correctly processing the other formatting could be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores used in the text might be escaped with a backslash to indicate they are not formatting symbols. This needs to be taken into account to avoid false positives for bold text.\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting**: There may be cases where the formatting is not correctly closed, such as an opening `**` without a closing `**`. Deciding how to handle these cases can affect the output.\n\n5. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or by indenting with four spaces) or inline code (single backticks `) is usually not formatted, so bold syntax within these should not be counted as bold text.\n\n6. **Links with bold text**: Links might contain bold text within their description. The parser must discern between the link syntax and the bold syntax to extract the intended text.\n\n7. **List items or headers with bold text**: Bold text might appear within list items or headers. Ensuring that the bold extraction operates correctly within these contexts is important.\n\nThese are just a few examples of what could complicate the process of extracting bold text from a Markdown file.
