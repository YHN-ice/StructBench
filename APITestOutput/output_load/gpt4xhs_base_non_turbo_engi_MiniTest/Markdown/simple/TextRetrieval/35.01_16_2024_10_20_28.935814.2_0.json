For instance, `**bold text**` and `__bold text__` are equivalent. A parser should handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Sometimes, bold text might be nested within other markup elements, such as links `[**bold text**](URL)` or italicized text `*italic and **bold** text*`. Properly extracting the bold portion requires the parser to recognize and handle nested structures.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape asterisks or underscores to prevent them from being parsed as Markdown, for example `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to differentiate between escaped and unescaped markers.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are not always used for bold text; they might appear in code blocks, where they should not be treated as emphasis markers, for instance:\n\n   ```\n   // This is a code block\n   function example() {\n     return \"**not bold**\";\n   }\n   ```\n   \n5. **Incomplete Markers**: Incomplete emphasis markers, such as `**bold` without a closing `**`, should not be considered as bold text, but it's possible that some parsers may mistakenly recognize them as such.\n\n6. **Inline Code Blocks**: Bold text within inline code blocks should not be treated as bold since it's meant to display code. For example, `` `**not bold**` `` is code, not bold text.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown does not traditionally support multiline bold text using the same set of markers without starting a new line, but some variations or extensions might, so the parser should be aware if multiline support is required.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust parsing strategy that can correctly interpret the Markdown syntax and context in which the bold markers appear."
