The standard format is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but sometimes the title might be omitted or the syntax might be slightly altered.\n\n2. **Inline vs Reference Image Links**: Markdown supports both inline image links (`![Alt](URL)`) and reference-style links (`![Alt][id]` followed somewhere by `[id]: URL`). The parser needs to handle both types.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute URLs**: Image URLs can be either relative to the document or absolute (including the full path or web URL). Depending on what's needed, the parser should extract the correct form of the URL.\n\n4. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There might be multiple images included on a single line, which would require the parser to correctly identify and separate each one.\n\n5. **Non-image Links**: The parser must differentiate between image links and regular hyperlinks to avoid false positives.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows for escaping characters that might otherwise be interpreted as markdown syntax (e.g., `\\!` instead of `!` for a literal exclamation mark), so the parser needs to recognize and ignore escaped image syntax.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Sometimes, images might be nested inside other markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\n8. **File Name Extraction**: After identifying an image URL, extracting just the file name (assuming that's what's wanted) could be challenging if the URL contains additional parameters or fragments.\n\n9. **Unsupported Formats or Typos**: The markdown might have typos or use unsupported formats for images that could trip up the parser.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: Special characters in image filenames might be URL-encoded in the Markdown source, necessitating decoding during extraction.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing strategy is required, possibly involving regular expressions or a dedicated markdown parsing library that can handle these nuances."
