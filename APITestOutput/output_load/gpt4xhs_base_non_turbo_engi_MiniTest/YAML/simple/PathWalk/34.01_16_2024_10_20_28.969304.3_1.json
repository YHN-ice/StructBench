For example, if there are multiple keys with the same name at different levels of nesting, it could be unclear which one is being referred to.\n\n3. **Complex Nesting**: YAML allows for complex nested structures, which can sometimes make it difficult to navigate to the correct level and extract the specific piece of data needed.\n\n4. **Type Conversions**: YAML supports various data types (strings, numbers, lists, etc.).
