Inconsistent indentation: The amount of indentation must be consistent throughout the document.\n4. Missing colons after keys: Each key-value pair must have a colon followed by a space.\n5. Dashes for list items: A dash followed by a space is used to denote list items within a sequence.\n6. Scalability issues: Very large YAML files can be problematic to parse due to their size and complexity.\n7. Incorrect data types: Errors can occur if the value assigned to a key is not of the expected data type.\n8.
