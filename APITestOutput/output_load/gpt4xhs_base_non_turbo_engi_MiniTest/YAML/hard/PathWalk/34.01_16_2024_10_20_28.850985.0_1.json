If the file contains multiple documents, it might be unclear which document contains the \"subs\" key.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows for aliases and anchors which can create references to other parts of the document.

The parser will need to correctly identify list items and their indices to find the \"first object\".\n\n7. **Errors in YAML**: If there are errors in the YAML file (e.g., bad indentation, syntax errors), it might not be parsed correctly, which would hinder extracting the information.\n\n8. **Large File Size**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be difficult to manually locate the relevant section without proper tooling or search capabilities.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML input, I'll attempt to parse it and answer your question assuming none of these potential difficulties prohibit me from doing so."
