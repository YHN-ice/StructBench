Parsing these correctly can be challenging as they may not appear visually nested.\n\n4. **References & Anchors**: YAML supports references and anchors, which can create logical but not physical nesting. Deciding whether to treat these as nested elements can be tricky.\n\n5. **Consistency in Output**: When asked to format output in a specific way, ensuring consistency (e.g., preserving indentation, comments) while extracting deeply nested objects might be difficult.\n\n6. **Document Separators**: A YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If not handled correctly, this could lead to confusion about which document contains the most deeply nested objects.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in 'Most Deeply Nested'**: The concept of \"most deeply nested\" could be subject to interpretation depending on whether you count the depth by levels of indentation or by actual parent-child relationships within the data structure.\n\nTo properly identify the most deeply nested objects, a parser would need to traverse the YAML structure carefully, keep track of the depth of each object, and ensure that only scalar values at the deepest level are reported.
