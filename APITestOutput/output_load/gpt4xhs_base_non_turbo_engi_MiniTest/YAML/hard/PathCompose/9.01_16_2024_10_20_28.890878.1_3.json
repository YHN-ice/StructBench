YAML Syntax: YAML is sensitive to indentation and other formatting details. A small mistake in indentation can change the structure of the data, making it difficult to access the desired value correctly.\n\n2. Complex Hierarchies: YAML files can have deeply nested structures which can make it challenging to trace the correct path to a specific value.\n\n3. Lists and Dictionaries: YAML supports both lists (arrays) and dictionaries (hashes), and they can be nested within each other. It's essential to distinguish between list indices (numeric) and dictionary keys (strings) when accessing elements.\n\n4. Scalars, Sequences, and Mappings: Understanding the difference between scalars (single values), sequences (lists), and mappings (key-value pairs) is crucial for accurate data extraction.\n\n5. Aliases and Anchors: YAML allows the use of aliases and anchors which can create references in the document. If not properly understood, they can complicate the retrieval of values.\n\n6. Data Types: YAML supports various data types such as strings, integers, floats, booleans, and nulls. Ensuring that the data is interpreted in the correct type is important for accurate processing.\n\n7. Inheritance and Overriding: In cases where YAML utilizes inheritance or value overriding, it may not be immediately clear which value is the effective one without fully understanding the document's structure.\n\n8. Variable Substitution: In some instances, variable substitution might be used within the YAML file, which can affect how the values should be accessed or interpreted.\n\n9. Comments: Comments in YAML are denoted by # and should be ignored by the parser. However, they can sometimes provide context that influences how we understand the structure.\n\n10. Special Characters: Special characters in keys or values might require appropriate handling or escaping to be processed correctly.\n\nEach of these obstacles requires careful consideration while writing a parser or accessing values manually to ensure accuracy."
