Different Commands: LaTeX can include figures using different commands or environments, such as `\\includegraphics`, `figure`, or even custom commands defined by the user. A parser must recognize all these possibilities.\n\n2. File Path Variations: The file path for figures can vary widely. They may include relative or absolute paths, and they may or may not include the file extension.\n\n3. Multiple Figures in One Command: A single command might include multiple figures, especially when using subfigure packages.\n\n4. Commented Code: Parts of the LaTeX document, including figure inclusions, might be commented out. The parser should ignore these.\n\n5. Optional Arguments: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that change the appearance of the figure but are not part of the file name.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser should:\n\n- Identify the correct commands or environments that include figures.\n- Extract the relevant file paths while ignoring optional arguments and commented-out code.\n- Handle multiple figures included in a single command or environment.\n- Normalize or disregard path variations to extract clean file names.\n\nNow you can provide me with the input LaTeX file, and I will proceed to extract the figure file names for you."
