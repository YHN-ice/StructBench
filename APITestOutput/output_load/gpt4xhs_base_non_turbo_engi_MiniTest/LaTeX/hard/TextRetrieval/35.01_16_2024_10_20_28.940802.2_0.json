One must account for all possible commands.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands may be nested within other commands or environments, making it more challenging to parse and extract just the bold text.\n\n3. **Bracket Matching**: Extracting the text within the bold command requires correctly matching the curly braces `{...}`, which can be non-trivial if there are nested braces.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol, which could potentially comment out a bold command. We need to ignore anything that is commented out.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: If the backslash `\\` or other characters are escaped within the LaTeX source, it might affect the parsing logic.\n\n6. **Custom Environments and Macros**: The LaTeX file might define custom environments or macros that change the way text is formatted, which could include making text bold without using standard commands. \n\n7. **Conditional Text**: Some text might be conditionally bolded using LaTeX conditional statements, which would require evaluating those conditions to determine if the text is actually bold.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, parsing a LaTeX file to extract bold texts requires careful consideration of the LaTeX syntax and semantics."
