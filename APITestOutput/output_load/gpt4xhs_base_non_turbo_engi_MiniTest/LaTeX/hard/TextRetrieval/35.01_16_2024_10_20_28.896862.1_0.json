We'll need to recognize all such patterns.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which can complicate extraction. For example, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{emphasis} within bold}`.\n\n3. **Split commands**: The command to bold text and the actual text might be split across lines or separated by comments, which could make it harder to identify bold text properly.\n\n4. **Parameter braces mismatches**: There might be unbalanced braces within the LaTeX commands, which can lead to parsing errors.\n\n5. **Custom environments**: A LaTeX file may define custom environments that change text to bold, which would not be recognized without parsing and understanding those custom definitions.\n\n6. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX begin with `%` and should not be parsed as part of the document content. Bold text within comments should not be extracted.\n\n7. **Escaped characters**: Special LaTeX characters like `{`, `}`, or `\\` might be escaped in the document and need to be treated differently from command characters.\n\nAddressing these issues requires a careful approach to parsing, potentially involving a state machine or a stack to keep track of command contexts and brace nesting levels."
