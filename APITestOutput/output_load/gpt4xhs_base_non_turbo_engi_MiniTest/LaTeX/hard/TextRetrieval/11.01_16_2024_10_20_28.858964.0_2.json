Each command may have a different syntax for including file names.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: The figures may not be included with just the file name, but could include relative or absolute paths. Extracting just the file names might require parsing these paths correctly.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX files might include the file extension (.jpg, .png, etc.), while others may omit them, relying on the LaTeX compiler to find the correct file. Consistency will need to be considered when extracting the names.\n\n4. **Options within Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command, for instance, can have options within square brackets before the file name is specified. These options need to be ignored when extracting the file names.\n\n5. **Commented Out Lines**: The LaTeX file may contain comments that include lines with `\\includegraphics` or similar commands which should not be considered as they are not actual inclusions of figures in the document.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: In some cases, LaTeX allows including multiple files within one command (e.g., using subfigures or custom commands). This case would require parsing each file name separately.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments**: If the LaTeX file defines custom commands or environments to include figures, these would need to be interpreted or expanded to extract the actual file names.\n\n8. **Environment-Dependent Inclusions**: Figures might be included within specific LaTeX environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), which could affect how the file names should be extracted.\n\n9. **Text Encapsulation**: Sometimes, file names might be encapsulated within other LaTeX commands or text, which could make direct extraction difficult without analyzing the surrounding context.\n\n10. **File Encoding and Format**: Depending on the encoding and format of the LaTeX source file, there could be issues with characters that need to be correctly interpreted (like special characters or spaces in file names). \n\nAddressing these issues requires careful parsing and potentially a need for heuristics or assumptions about how figures are typically included in LaTeX documents. It might also be necessary to use or develop a LaTeX parsing library that can handle these complexities."
