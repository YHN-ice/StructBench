Handling both cases is necessary.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: A single line can include multiple figures, especially when using subfigure packages or when figures are included within a loop or macro.\n\n5. **Comments**: Lines with figure includes could be commented out with the `%` symbol, and these should not be considered as actual includes.\n\n6. **Options within Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options (like scale, width, height) which need to be properly ignored to extract the filename.\n\n7. **Curly Bracket Variations**: The figure file name could be enclosed with curly brackets `{}` which may have nested brackets for options that need to be parsed correctly.\n\n8. **Wildcard Inclusion**: Rarely, a wildcard might be used to include multiple files at once (though this is not standard LaTeX practice).\n\n9. **Custom Commands or Macros**: The LaTeX file might define custom commands or macros that include figures, which would require understanding and expanding those macros to find the actual file names.\n\n10. **Environment Dependencies**: The included figures might be within specific environments that impact how they should be parsed (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.).\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in writing a parser that can accurately extract all included figure files from the LaTeX document."
