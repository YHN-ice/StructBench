The file might also use packages that change the syntax for including figures.\n\n2. Optional arguments: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that modify the inclusion of the figure, such as scale, width, height, angle, etc. These optional arguments might complicate the regex or parsing logic.\n\n3. File extensions: LaTeX allows for omitting the file extension of the included graphics, as it can search for common graphic file extensions automatically.

Comments: Parts of the LaTeX document, including figure inclusion commands, could be commented out. The parser needs to ignore these.\n\n6. Custom commands and environments: LaTeX allows users to define custom commands and environments which could obscure direct figure inclusions.\n\n7.
