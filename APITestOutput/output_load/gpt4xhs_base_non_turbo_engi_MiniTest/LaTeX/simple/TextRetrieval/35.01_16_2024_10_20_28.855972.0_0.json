Common obstacles in this process might include:\n\n1. **Different commands for bold**: LaTeX provides multiple ways to make text bold, such as `\\textbf{}`, `\\bf{}`, or even custom commands defined in the preamble that result in bold text.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested within other commands or environments, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Command Parameters**: Sometimes parameters or options can be passed to the bold command that might affect how the command is written and therefore how it should be parsed.\n\n4. **Comments**: A line in LaTeX starting with `%` is a comment and might contain what looks like a bold command, but since it's commented out, it shouldn't be considered.\n\n5. **Brace Matching**: In LaTeX, curly braces `{}` denote the scope of the command. Correctly matching these is crucial to extract the correct text.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The document may define custom commands or environments that change text to bold, so we need to be aware of these when parsing.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: If the backslash `\\` or other characters used in LaTeX commands are escaped, they won't function as command initiators, and this needs to be taken into account.\n\n8. **Inline vs. Block**: Bold text can appear inline with other text or as separate blocks (e.g., within an environment). Both cases need to be handled correctly.\n\n9. **Text Outside Bold Command**: Making sure we only extract the text that is meant to be bold and not any adjacent text outside of the bold commands.\n\nAddressing these issues requires a careful parsing strategy, potentially using regular expressions, and a good understanding of the LaTeX document structure."
