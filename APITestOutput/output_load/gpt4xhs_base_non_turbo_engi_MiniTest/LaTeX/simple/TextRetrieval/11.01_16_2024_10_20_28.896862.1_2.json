The parser must recognize all possible commands that can include figures.\n\n2. **Different paths**: Figures can be included from various directories, and the path could be absolute or relative. Differentiating between the file path and the filename is necessary.\n\n3. **File extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension when including a figure, other times they do not. The parser needs to account for both scenarios.\n\n4. **Options in include commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command often comes with options inside square brackets before the actual filename which could complicate extraction (e.g., `\\includegraphics[width=3cm]{fig1.png}`).\n\n5. **Commented lines**: Lines that are commented out with `%` should not be considered, as they do not result in included images in the final document.\n\n6. **Multiple figures in one command**: LaTeX allows for including multiple files within one command, separated by commas (especially within figure environments like `subfigure` or `subfig`).\n\n7. **Commands spread over multiple lines**: Sometimes commands may be broken over multiple lines, which can complicate pattern recognition.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the parser must be robust enough to handle various scenarios to correctly extract all figure file names."
