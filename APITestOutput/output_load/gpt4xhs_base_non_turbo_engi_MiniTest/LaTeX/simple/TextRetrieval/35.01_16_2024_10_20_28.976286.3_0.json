It is necessary to recognize all possible commands that denote bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands may be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` for command arguments. To correctly extract the text, it's important to match opening and closing braces, even when they are nested.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Text may appear to be marked as bold within comments (`%`) or inactive code blocks, which should not be considered as part of the output.\n\n5. **Custom Environments**: Bold text may be part of a custom environment that changes the text weight to bold without the explicit use of a bold command. Understanding these environments would require parsing and interpreting custom definitions.\n\n6. **Conditional Text**: Sometimes LaTeX includes conditional statements that may alter whether text appears in bold or not, depending on the conditions when the document is compiled.\n\n7. **Special Characters**: Special characters within the bold text might need to be handled or escaped properly.\n\n8. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands**: If the LaTeX is incomplete or has errors like missing braces, it could cause issues in accurately parsing the file.\n\nThese are potential difficulties that might hinder the process of extracting bold text correctly.
