Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered when trying to extract bold texts from an ORG file:\n\n1. **Syntax Variability**: In Org mode, bold text can be represented in different ways. The standard syntax for bold is wrapping the text with asterisks like `*bold text*`. However, there could be variations or mistakes in the syntax such as uneven asterisks, spaces within the asterisks, or other formatting marks interfering.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underline, or code blocks, which could make straightforward parsing challenging.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used in Org mode for creating headings and lists. It's important to distinguish when asterisks are used for formatting bold text and when they are part of the structural elements of the file.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: In some cases, the asterisks could be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which means they are not meant to format the text as bold but to be included as literal characters.\n\n5. **Inline Code or Verbatim**: Bold syntax might appear inside inline code or verbatim blocks, where it should not be treated as formatting but as literal characters.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it may require a more complex parsing strategy that can handle multiline patterns.\n\n7. **File Content Encoding**: The file encoding might cause issues if it's not UTF-8 or ASCII, as special characters might not be parsed correctly.\n\n8. **Distinguishing from Other Markup Elements**: The parser needs to correctly ignore non-bold markup elements like links, images, or other embedded objects.\n\nTo properly extract bold texts, the parser must take these potential issues into account and implement logic to handle each case appropriately."
