ORG files typically use links that might look like `[[file:imagename.jpg]]`.\n\n2. **Variety of Image Formats:** Images can be in various formats like JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, etc. Our parser needs to recognize all possible image formats.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths:** Images might be linked with relative paths (e.g., `./images/pic.png`) or absolute paths (e.g., `/home/user/images/pic.png`). We need to extract only the file name, without any path information.\n\n4. **Inline Display vs Attachment:** Images might be displayed inline within the text or attached as a file entity. We should handle both scenarios appropriately.\n\n5. **Linked vs Embedded Images:** Some images might not be physically included but linked from external sources. We need to differentiate between linked external images and those included in the file.\n\n6. **Multiple Links in a Single Line:** There might be lines with more than one image link, so our parser should be capable of detecting and extracting multiple image names from a single line.\n\n7. **Text Similar to Links:** There might be regular text that resembles link syntax but isn't an actual link. The parser should avoid false positives.\n\n8. **File Name Extraction:** Once a link is identified as an image link, we need to parse the string to extract just the file name.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we'll apply these considerations to ensure we extract all included image file names accurately."
