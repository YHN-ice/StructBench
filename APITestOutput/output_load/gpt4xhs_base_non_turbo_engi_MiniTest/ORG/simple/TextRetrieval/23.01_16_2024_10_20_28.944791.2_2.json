We need to account for all the possible syntax variations that could be used to include an image.\n\n2. **Path variations**: Image files can be included using absolute or relative paths, and could also be in different directories or subdirectories.\n\n3. **File extensions**: There are multiple image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and we need to recognize all the possible image file extensions included in the ORG file.\n\n4. **Embedded vs. linked images**: Some images might be embedded directly in the file, while others might just be linked. We need to distinguish between these types to extract only the file names of linked images.\n\n5. **Markup noise**: ORG files can contain a lot of other markup for formatting, which could make it harder to identify the image file names if they're not clearly marked or if the markup is complex.\n\n6. **Multi-line links**: Sometimes, an image link might be split across multiple lines, which would require the parser to handle multi-line parsing to correctly extract the file name.\n\n7. **Escape characters**: Filenames or paths might include special characters that are escaped in some way, which would need to be correctly interpreted to get the actual file name.\n\n8. **Comments**: Images that are commented out should probably not be included in the output since they are not actually part of the rendered document.\n\nOnce we see the input ORG file, we'll need to address these potential difficulties to accurately extract all included image file names."
