However, variations or inconsistencies in the formatting (such as extra spaces like `* bold *` or missing one of the asterisks) could make it harder to accurately detect all bold texts.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links, code blocks, or italic text. This could complicate the extraction process since the parser would need to correctly interpret multiple layers of formatting without getting confused.\n\n3. **Escaping Characters**: Any asterisks used for purposes other than bold formatting (such as in lists or as literal asterisks) would need to be correctly recognized and not mistaken for bold formatting.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If a bold text spans multiple lines, the parser would need to handle line breaks properly to ensure complete extraction of the bold content.\n\n5. **Diverse Content**: ORG files can contain a wide variety of content from plain text to executable code blocks. The parser must differentiate between content types to avoid extracting non-relevant bold-like patterns from code blocks or other non-text elements.\n\n6. **File Size**: Large files with a lot of content might pose a performance issue, depending on the efficiency of the parser.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll be able to provide a more accurate list of challenges specific to that file or confirm if any of these general potential obstacles apply."
