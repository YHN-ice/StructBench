For example, text might be wrapped with one or more pairs of asterisks (e.g., `*word*` or `**word**`).\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could also be nested within other formatting, such as italic or underlined text, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: The presence of special characters like asterisks within the text (which aren't indicating bold) could lead to false positives.\n\n4. **Line Breaks**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it might require a more complex parsing strategy to correctly identify and extract the full text.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the ORG file was not consistently formatted, some bold text might not be marked up properly.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Examples**: Text within code blocks or example blocks should not be considered as bold, even if it contains asterisks.\n\n7. **Escaped Asterisks**: Asterisks used for purposes other than formatting (e.g., in a URL or as a bullet point) might be escaped (e.g., `\\*`). These should not be confused with formatting asterisks.\n\n8. **Contextual Parsing**: Understanding the context of asterisks is important because they could be used for list items or other structural elements in ORG mode rather than for bold formatting.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parsing algorithm would need to be context-aware and handle different cases of formatting and special characters appropriately to ensure accurate extraction of only the intended bold text."
