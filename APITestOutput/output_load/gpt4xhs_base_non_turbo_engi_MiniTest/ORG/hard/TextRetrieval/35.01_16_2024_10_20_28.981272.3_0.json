Parsing out bold text requires correct identification and understanding of this syntax.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. Ensuring that only the bold text is extracted without including other formatting can be challenging.\n\n3. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text may span multiple lines, so the parser will need to handle line breaks correctly to extract the entire bold phrase.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users may not always follow the correct syntax for bold text, leading to inconsistencies that could make automated extraction difficult.\n\n5. **Escaping Characters**: Asterisks used for other purposes in the text (e.g., as bullet points or within code blocks) might be mistaken for bold syntax; handling escaping characters is necessary to differentiate between these cases.\n\n6. **False Positives**: Lines that contain asterisks but are not meant to be bold (e.g., mathematical expressions) could mistakenly be extracted as bold text.\n\n7. **Embedded Links or Tags**: ORG files may contain links or tags within bold text, which might need to be handled separately or excluded from the raw text output.\n\nThese are general considerations when writing a parser for ORG files to extract bold text. Specific details of the ORG file syntax and examples would be needed to provide a more accurate answer or script to solve the actual problem."
