Inconsistencies can lead to incorrect filtering of records.\n\n2. **Multiple Entries**: The same person might have multiple entries (rows with the same primeKey). It's essential to make sure that we don't count a person more than once.\n\n3. **Data Types**: Height and state data might not be in the expected format (e.g., height in feet instead of cm, or state abbreviations not standardized), which would require conversion or standardization before filtering.\n\n4. **Missing Data**: Some records might have missing or incomplete information for height or state, which could affect the count. We need a strategy to handle such cases.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The data might contain errors that need to be accounted for, such as non-numeric values in the height column or incorrect state codes.\n\n6. **Performance Concerns**: If the dataset is particularly large, performance might become an issue, necessitating efficient parsing and querying methods to ensure timely results.\n\n7. **Case Sensitivity**: The comparison of state codes should be case-insensitive since 'IL' and 'il' should be treated as the same state.\n\nOnce these potential issues are addressed, we can proceed with parsing the input file and providing an accurate answer to the question."
