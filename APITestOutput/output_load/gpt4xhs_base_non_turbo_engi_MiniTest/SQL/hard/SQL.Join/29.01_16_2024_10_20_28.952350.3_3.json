Missing Data: Some rows might be missing the height or location data, making it difficult to determine if a person meets both criteria.\n\n2. Inconsistent Data Formats: Heights could be recorded in different units (e.g., inches vs. centimeters) or using various formats. The location data might also be inconsistently formatted (e.g., \"New York\" vs. \"NY\" or including/excluding borough names).\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we must ensure we do not count any individual more than once.\n\n4. Data Spread Across Rows: If the person's height and work location are spread across different rows with the same primeKey, we will need to consolidate this information before determining if they meet both criteria.\n\n5. Ambiguities in Location Data: There might be ambiguities in determining what constitutes \"working in NY\"—for example, if someone works remotely for a company based in NY but lives elsewhere.\n\n6. Data Integrity Issues: There may be errors in the data such as typos, incorrect entries, or unrealistic values that could affect accuracy.\n\n7. Sorting and Filtering: Depending on the size of the data table, we might need efficient sorting and filtering methods to manage and process the data effectively.\n\n8. Complex Data Structures: Data might come in complex structures like nested arrays or objects, which would require advanced parsing techniques.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help us to prepare appropriate strategies for parsing and analyzing the datatable accurately.
