Multiple Entries per Person: If the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, care must be taken not to count a person more than once if their data is spread across multiple rows.\n\n3.

Data Volume: A large dataset could present performance issues, requiring efficient searching and sorting algorithms to process the data in a reasonable time frame.\n\n5. Sorting and Filtering: The data will need to be sorted or filtered to identify those individuals with salaries above the specified threshold, which may require writing or employing complex logic depending on the structure of the datatable.\n\n6.
