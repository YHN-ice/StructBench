Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered when trying to determine how many people have a salary more than $172,872:\n\n1. Data Formatting: The salary data might be formatted inconsistently across the datatable, making it difficult to parse and compare numerically. For instance, salaries might include commas, dollar signs, or even be written out in text form.\n\n2. Inconsistent or Missing Data: Some entries in the datatable might have missing or incomplete salary information, which would require additional steps to handle or clean up the data.\n\n3. Duplication of Entries: If the same person's data is entered more than once with different salary information, there needs to be a method to deduplicate the entries or determine which one is the most recent and accurate.\n\n4. Large Datasets: If the datatable is very large, it could pose performance issues for certain parsing methods or algorithms, necessitating efficient approaches for filtering and aggregating the data.\n\n5. Complex Query Logic: The requirement to filter for salaries \"more than $172,872\" could involve complex query logic, especially if the datatable requires joining multiple tables or handling complex conditional statements.\n\n6. Data Type Issues: Salaries may need to be converted from string to numerical data types to perform numerical comparisons. This could be complicated by various formatting issues mentioned earlier.\n\n7. Ambiguous Definitions: The definition of \"salary\" might be ambiguous—does it include bonuses, commissions, or other forms of compensation, or is it strictly the base salary?\n\n8. Data Sorting and Aggregation: To answer the question accurately, you may need to sort or group data appropriately, ensuring that all relevant records are included in the count.\n\n9. PrimeKey Relationships: Understanding that rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person is critical; however, it might not always be clear how to handle multiple entries for a single person if they exist.\n\n10. Reliability of Data Source: The integrity and accuracy of the data source itself might be questionable, and cross-referencing or verification could be necessary.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful parsing and perhaps preprocessing of the datatable will be necessary to ensure accurate results."
