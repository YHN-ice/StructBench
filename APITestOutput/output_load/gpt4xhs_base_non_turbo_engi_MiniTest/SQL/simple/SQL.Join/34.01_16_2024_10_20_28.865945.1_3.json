We'd need a strategy to handle such cases.\n\n3. **Height Units**: Height could be recorded in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches). We'll need to confirm that all height measurements are in the same unit or convert them as needed.\n\n4. **Missing Data**: Some rows might have missing information regarding either the state (TX) or the height, which would require a decision on how to handle incomplete records.\n\n5. **Data Formatting**: The height could be stored in a format that needs parsing, such as a string with 'cm' or 'm' appended, requiring a preprocessing step to extract numeric values.\n\n6. **State Representation**: The state could be represented in different ways (e.g., 'TX', 'Texas', 'Tx'), necessitating a normalization step to ensure consistent state identification.\n\n7. **Sorting and Filtering**: The datatable will need to be sorted or filtered based on the state and height criteria, requiring careful implementation to avoid errors in the selection process.\n\n8. **Case Sensitivity**: When matching text fields like state codes, case sensitivity might be an issue. We'll have to decide whether to perform case-insensitive comparisons.\n\n9. **Non-human Error**: If automated systems were involved in data entry, there might be non-human errors such as systematic mislabeling or data corruption.\n\nOnce these potential difficulties are addressed and we ensure that the data is properly preprocessed and consistent, we can proceed to parse the datatable accurately to answer the question."
