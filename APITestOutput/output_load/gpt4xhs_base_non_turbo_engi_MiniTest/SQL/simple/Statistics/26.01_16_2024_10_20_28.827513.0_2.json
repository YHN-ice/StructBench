Ambiguous Gender Information: There might be ambiguous entries where the gender is not clearly stated or is listed under non-binary options; careful consideration is needed to determine how to handle these cases.\n\n5. Data Errors: Typos or incorrect data entries might lead to misclassification of gender, necessitating a data cleaning process.\n\n6.
