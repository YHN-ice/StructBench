For example, salaries might be listed with different currencies, or some might include commas while others do not.\n\n3. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: There might be missing or incomplete salary information, which would require additional steps to handle or clean the data.\n\n4. **Duplicate Entries**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we need to ensure that we're not counting the same person more than once if their salary is listed in multiple rows.\n\n5. **Data Sorting/Filtering**: We will need to sort or filter the data to focus only on the subset of individuals whose salaries exceed 865521.\n\n6. **Data Parsing**: We must correctly parse the salary values from the datatable as numerical data to perform the comparison.\n\n7. **Performance Considerations**: For large datasets, the performance of the parsing algorithm matters. An inefficient algorithm may take a long time to provide an answer.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: There may be unexpected or malformed data that could cause errors during parsing. Robust error handling would be required to deal with such issues.\n\nOnce the datatable is provided, these challenges can be addressed accordingly in order to extract the correct answer."
