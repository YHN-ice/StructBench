For example, it is not clear if we should consider base salary only, or include bonuses, stock options, etc.\n\n6. **Data Access or Permissions**: Access to the data file might require specific permissions that could prevent us from retrieving the information needed.\n\n7. **Data Consistency**: The dataset might not be consistent in terms of how salaries are reported (e.g., annual vs. monthly salary) or could contain errors that would affect the count.\n\nOnce I have access to the input data and know its format and structure, I will be better able to address these challenges and answer the question accurately."
