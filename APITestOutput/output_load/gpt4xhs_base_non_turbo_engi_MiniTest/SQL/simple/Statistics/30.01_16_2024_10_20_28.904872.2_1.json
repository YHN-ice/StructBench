Clarification may be needed to ensure accurate comparisons.\n\n8. **Text encoding issues:** If the datatable comes from an external source or has been exported in a particular encoding, there may be issues in reading special characters or symbols correctly.\n\nBefore starting the parsing process, it's important to anticipate these challenges and prepare strategies for dealing with them effectively."
