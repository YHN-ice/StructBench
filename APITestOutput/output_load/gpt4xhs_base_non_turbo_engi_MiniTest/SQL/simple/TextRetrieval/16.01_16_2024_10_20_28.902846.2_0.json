Ambiguity in the status field: The \"status\" could be represented in various ways (e.g., textual descriptions, codes, symbols) that may not be immediately clear without additional context or a legend explaining the meaning.\n\n5. Data format and parsing: The data might come in a format that is difficult to parse programmatically (e.g., PDF, image, unstructured text). This would require additional steps to extract and transform the data into a usable format.\n\n6.
