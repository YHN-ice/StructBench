Mismatched or improperly nested brackets can cause errors.\n3. **Unquoted or misquoted keys and strings**: In JSON, keys and string values should be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and unquoted keys can cause errors.\n4. **Trailing commas**: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an object or array.\n5. **Data types**: JSON only supports certain data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null).
