Identifying all such objects can be difficult if they are not at the same nesting level within their respective hierarchies.\n\n4. **Data Types and Structures**: JSON supports various data types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. The parser needs to correctly distinguish between these types and consider only those paths that lead to non-list and non-dict values at the deepest level.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Data Structures**: If the structure of the JSON is inconsistent or if there are schema changes within the file, it can complicate the process of identifying deeply nested objects.\n\n6. **Memory Limitations**: If the JSON is very large, there may be memory limitations that prevent it from being fully loaded into memory for parsing.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: Malformed JSON or unexpected data types at various levels can cause errors in parsing, which will need to be gracefully handled to avoid crashing the parser.\n\n8. **Performance Optimization**: The algorithm used should be optimized for performance to handle complex and large JSON structures in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nOnce I have access to the input JSON file, these potential difficulties will guide me in accurately identifying the most deeply nested objects."
