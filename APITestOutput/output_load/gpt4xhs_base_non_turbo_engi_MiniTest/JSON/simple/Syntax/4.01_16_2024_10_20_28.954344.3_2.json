Common mistakes include missing or extra commas, missing quotation marks, braces, or brackets.\n\n2. **Data Types**: Ensuring that data types are correctly used and consistent throughout the file. For example, strings should be within quotes, numbers should not be, and booleans should be true or false without quotes.\n\n3. **Nested Objects or Arrays**: Deeply nested objects or arrays can make it difficult to track the opening and closing of each element.\n\n4. **Size of the File**: Large files may be more challenging to manually check for errors and may require automated tools to parse effectively.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: If the file contains special characters, they need to be correctly encoded; otherwise, they might cause parsing errors.\n\n6. **Trailing Commas**: Trailing commas after the last element in an object or array are not allowed in JSON and can cause errors.\n\n7. **Unescaped Characters**: Special characters like quotes or backslashes within strings must be escaped correctly.\n\n8. **Comments**: JSON does not support comments, and any presence of comments will result in errors.\n\nOnce I have access to the JSON file, I will check for these potential issues to determine if there are any structural errors."
