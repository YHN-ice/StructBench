Complex Nesting Structures: JSON files can have very complex nesting structures, with objects within arrays within objects, and so on. Determining the depth of nesting and identifying the most deeply nested objects can be challenging.\n\n2. Large Files: If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to process it all at once due to memory constraints.\n\n3. Variability in Data Types: JSON supports various data types including objects (dicts), arrays (lists), strings, numbers, booleans, and null. The most deeply nested object might contain any combination of these types.\n\n4. Identifying Objects Without List or Dict Values: You've specified that we should identify objects that don't contain values of type list or dict. This requires careful inspection of the values to ensure they're not collections.\n\n5. Ambiguity in Most Deeply Nested: There could be multiple objects at the same level of nesting, making it necessary to return all of them.\n\n6. Recursive Structures: Some JSON structures might have recursive references which can complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. Multiple Paths to an Object: An object might be reachable through several paths, making it appear more than once during traversal if not handled properly.\n\n8. Incomplete or Malformed JSON: If the JSON file is not well-formed or is incomplete, it may cause parsing errors.\n\n9. Performance and Optimization: Depending on the approach taken, parsing and searching for the most deeply nested objects can be computationally intensive.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser needs to:\n\n- Handle different data types and be able to traverse nested structures.\n- Be efficient to deal with potentially large files.\n- Keep track of the depth while traversing to identify the deepest level.\n- Ensure that it only returns unique objects that meet the criteria regardless of how many times they're referenced or how they're reached.\n- Handle edge cases such as recursive structures and malformed JSON gracefully.\n- Optimize for performance to handle intensive computations.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties, I am ready to proceed with parsing the given JSON file and identifying the most deeply nested objects without list or dict values as requested.
