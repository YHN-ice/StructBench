For instance, there might be multiple paths to different objects that are equally deeply nested but in different branches of the hierarchy.\n\n5. **Format Consistency:** The JSON file must be well-formed and consistent in its structure to accurately parse it without errors.\n\n6. **Recursive Function Complexity:** A recursive function is often used to navigate through nested JSON objects.
