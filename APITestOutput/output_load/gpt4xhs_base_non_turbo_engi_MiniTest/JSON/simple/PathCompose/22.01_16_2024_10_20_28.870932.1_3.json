Ensuring that you handle each type correctly is essential for accurate data retrieval.\n\n5. **Large files**: Large JSON files might be cumbersome to work with and can lead to performance issues if not handled efficiently.\n\n6. **Syntax errors**: JSON is strict in terms of its syntax. Missing commas, quotation marks, or brackets can lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Encoding**: Proper handling of text encoding is required to ensure that all characters in the JSON file are interpreted correctly.\n\n8. **Access permissions**: If the JSON file is stored remotely or has restricted access, you might encounter permission issues when trying to read it.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser must be equipped to navigate complex structures, handle various data types, deal with large datasets efficiently, and ensure correct syntax and encoding are used."
