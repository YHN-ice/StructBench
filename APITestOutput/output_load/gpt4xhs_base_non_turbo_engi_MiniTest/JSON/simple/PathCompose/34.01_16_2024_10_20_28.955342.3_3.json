This would require a more dynamic approach to accessing values.\n\n5. **Type Errors**: When traversing a JSON object, it's crucial to know whether you're dealing with an object or an array at each level to use the correct notation (key for objects, index for arrays).\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be challenging to manually find the key path. Automation or search functions might be necessary.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: Incorrect syntax, such as missing brackets or quotation marks, could lead to errors in accessing the data.\n\n8. **Data Type Mismatch**: Expecting a value to be a string while it's actually a number or a boolean (or vice versa) could cause confusion when trying to access it.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the process may require careful navigation through the JSON structure and attention to the data types and hierarchy levels involved."
