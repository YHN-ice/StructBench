I need to correctly interpret the file format before I can parse the tree.\n\n2. Complex tree structure: The tree might have a complex structure with many nodes and branches. A robust algorithm is required to traverse the tree and determine the height accurately.\n\n3. Multiple longest paths: There may be multiple longest paths from the root node to leaf nodes, and I need to ensure that I find the correct height even in these cases.\n\n4. Incorrect or ambiguous data: The file might contain errors, inconsistencies, or ambiguities that complicate the parsing process.\n\n5. Large file size: If the file is large, it could lead to performance issues and require efficient parsing methods to handle it without excessive resource consumption.\n\n6. Nested structures: The tree could have nested structures that need careful handling to avoid misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n7.
