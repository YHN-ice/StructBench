Navigating this structure can be challenging without a well-defined algorithm.\n\n3. **Lack of Standardized Node Naming:** Depending on the source of the tree file, nodes may not be named consistently, which can make it difficult to identify the target node \"vc\" without additional context.\n\n4. **Missing Information:** The tree file might be incomplete or corrupted, which would make it impossible to determine the depth accurately.\n\n5. **Edges Notation:** In some tree representations, edges rather than nodes are labeled, which could require additional steps to associate the labels with nodes correctly.\n\n6. **Unseen Nodes:** If a tree is very large, some nodes may not be visible in the provided input or might be condensed for simplicity.
