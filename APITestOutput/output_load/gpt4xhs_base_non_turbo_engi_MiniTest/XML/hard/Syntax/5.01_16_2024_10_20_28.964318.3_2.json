Proper syntax for tags and attributes:\n   - Tags must be properly opened `<tag>` and closed `</tag>`.\n   - Attributes should be quoted correctly.\n\n3. Entity References: Special characters in XML need to be replaced with entity references (e.g., `&` should be `&amp;`).\n\n4. DTD/Schema Validation: Although not required for a file to be well-formed, an XML file may also adhere to a specific structure defined by a Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML Schema.
