Heights might be in centimeters or inches, and work locations might be in abbreviations or full names. I'll need to standardize these to make meaningful comparisons.\n\n3. **Missing Data**: Some entries might have missing information regarding height or work location. I would need a strategy to handle such cases, like skipping these entries or making assumptions based on available data.\n\n4. **Errors in Data Entry**: There might be typos or incorrect entries in the data, which could lead to inaccurate counts. Being able to spot and correct these errors would be crucial.\n\n5. **Filtering and Sorting Data**: The process will involve filtering the data to include only those individuals who work in NY and then sorting or filtering again to include only those over 164 cm tall. It will be important to perform these operations correctly.\n\n6. **Large Data Sets**: If the datatable is very large, performance could become an issue. Efficient parsing and data handling techniques might be necessary to handle a large volume of data.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Location Names**: The abbreviation \"NY\" typically refers to New York, but without context, it could potentially refer to other things. We have to assume that \"NY\" refers to New York in this case.\n\nOnce I have access to the datatable, I will address these potential difficulties as needed to arrive at the correct answer."
