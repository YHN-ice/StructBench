Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the parsing process:\n\n1. Inconsistent Data Formats: Heights could be recorded in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches, feet) or formats (e.g., 5'10\" vs. 178 cm), which would require standardization before comparison.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some rows could have missing height or location data, which would need to be handled appropriately (e.g., excluded from the count).\n\n3. Duplicate Records: The same individual might appear multiple times in the dataset with the same or different information. Since the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, duplicates must be identified and counted only once.\n\n4. Data Entry Errors: There might be typos or incorrect entries for height or location that could lead to inaccuracies in the final count.\n\n5. Mixed Data Types: Numerical data like height might be mixed with text in the same column, necessitating data cleaning to extract usable numerical values.\n\n6. Multiple Locations: An individual might have multiple work locations listed. If one of those is GA, it must be considered even if it's not the only location mentioned.\n\n7. Ambiguous Location Codes: There might be other location codes similar to GA that could be confused with the state of Georgia, so it's important to ensure that only those specifically working in GA are counted.\n\nOverall, careful data inspection, cleaning, and standardization would be necessary before accurately answering the question."
