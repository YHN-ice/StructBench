Data Quality and Consistency: The dataset might have inconsistent or missing data, such as missing height or location entries, which could make it challenging to accurately count the number of individuals.\n\n2. Data Format: The height information may not be in a consistent unit or format—some entries could be in centimeters while others could be in meters or inches, requiring unit conversion for accurate comparison.\n\n3. Multiple Entries: Individuals might have multiple entries with the same primeKey, meaning the parser has to accurately merge or deduplicate records based on the primeKey to ensure individuals are not counted more than once.\n\n4. Handling Non-Numeric Values: The dataset could contain non-numeric values or outliers in the height column that need to be handled appropriately (e.g., filtering out non-numeric data, handling entries like \"155cm\" where the unit is included with the number).\n\n5. Case Sensitivity and Variations: The location 'WA' could appear in different cases (e.g., 'wa', 'Wa', 'wA') or formats (e.g., 'Washington', 'W.A.'), so the parser needs to handle these variations to ensure accurate counting.\n\n6. Complex Filtering: The task requires two conditions to be met simultaneously—the person must work in WA and be taller than 154 cm, so the logic must correctly filter and count entries that satisfy both conditions.\n\n7. Data Volume: If the dataset is large, performance considerations may come into play, requiring efficient parsing and querying techniques to handle the data without excessive processing time.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, it would be important to pre-process the data to ensure consistency, normalize units, handle duplicates properly, implement robust filtering criteria, and use case-insensitive comparison for string values."
