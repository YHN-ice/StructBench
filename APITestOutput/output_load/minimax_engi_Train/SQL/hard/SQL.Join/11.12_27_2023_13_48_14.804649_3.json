Data Format: Heights might be stored as strings with units included (e.g., \"168cm\") which would require parsing to extract numerical values for comparison.\n\n5. Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, it might be challenging to process it efficiently, and we'd need to use appropriate data processing techniques to handle this.\n\n6. Error Handling: We need to consider the possibility of errors in the data and have a strategy for handling any anomalies or unexpected values.\n\n7. Ambiguity in Location: If the location field includes various levels of granularity (city, state, country), we will have to correctly identify and filter for those specifically working in California (CA).\n\nOnce we have the datatable available, these potential issues can be addressed systematically to ensure an accurate count of people working in CA who are taller than 167 cm."
