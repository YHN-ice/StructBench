Missing or Inconsistent Data: Some rows might have missing height or location data, which would make it challenging to determine who meets the criteria.\n\n2. Data Formatting Issues: Heights could be recorded in different units (e.g., inches vs. centimeters) or formats (e.g., as a string with text like \"cm\" or \"inches\" included). This would require conversion or cleaning before analysis.\n\n3. Multiple Rows for the Same Person: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there may be multiple entries for one person with different pieces of information. It will be important to ensure that we don't double-count individuals and that we properly consolidate data for each unique individual.\n\n4. Large Volume of Data: If the datatable is particularly large, it might be computationally intensive to process all the data, and efficient parsing methods will be necessary.\n\n5. Ambiguous Location Data: The term \"CA\" could refer to California in the United States or another place with the same abbreviation. We need to confirm that \"CA\" is consistently referring to the correct location.\n\n6. Data Integrity Issues: The datatable might contain errors or outliers that make no sense (e.g., a height of 500 cm), which would need to be identified and handled appropriately.\n\n7. PrimeKey Integrity: It's possible there could be errors with the primeKey that would lead to misidentification of unique individuals or duplication of records.\n\n8. Complex Query: The combination of filters (working in CA and being taller than 179) could complicate the query, especially if the relevant information is spread across multiple rows for a single individual due to the multiple rows per person setup.\n\nAddressing these potential issues will be key to accurately parsing the datatable and providing a correct count of people who work in CA and are taller than 179."
