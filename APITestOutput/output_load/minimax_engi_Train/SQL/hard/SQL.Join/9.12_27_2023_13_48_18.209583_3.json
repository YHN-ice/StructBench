For example, heights could be recorded in different units (centimeters, meters, feet, etc.), and locations might use various abbreviations or full names for states (CA, Cal., California, etc.).\n\n3. **Missing Data:** There might be incomplete records where either the height or location data is missing for certain individuals.\n\n4. **Data Format & Parsing Errors:** The data might not be cleanly formatted, which could require cleaning or transforming data before analysis. For instance, heights might be listed as strings with units attached (e.g., \"152cm\"), requiring extraction of numerical values.\n\n5. **Duplicate Records:** There could be duplicate records for the same person that need to be identified and handled appropriately to avoid counting someone twice.\n\n6. **Data Volume:** If the dataset is very large, it may present computational efficiency challenges and require optimized parsing strategies.\n\n7. **Filtering Logic:** Proper logical conditions must be applied to filter out people who work in CA and are taller than 150. This means a two-level filter where both conditions have to be met simultaneously.\n\n8. **Type Conversion:** Numerical operations on height will require conversion from strings to an appropriate numeric type if they aren't already in that form.\n\n9. **Handling Exceptions:** The code must robustly handle any unexpected or malformed data without crashing.\n\nBy anticipating these potential obstacles, we can proceed more carefully in parsing the datatable to ensure an accurate response."

        "To answer the question, we need to filter the datatables based on the location and height. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Data Joining:** First, we need to join the two datatables using the 'primeKey' as the common key. This will give us a single table with all the required information.\n\n2. **Data Cleaning:** Next, we need to clean the data. This may involve removing any duplicate records, converting heights to a consistent unit (e.g., meters), and handling any missing or inconsistent data.\n\n3. **Filtering:** After cleaning the data, we can apply the filter conditions. We need to find people who work in CA (location = 'CA') and are taller than 150 (height > 150).\n\n4. **Counting:** Finally, we can count the number of people who meet both conditions.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements this approach using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the datatables\ndf1 = pd.read_csv('table1.csv')\ndf2 = pd.read_csv('table2.csv')\n\n# Join the datatables\ndf = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='primeKey')\n\n# Clean the data\ndf = df.drop_duplicates()\ndf['height'] = df['height'].astype(float)  # Convert height to float\n\n# Apply the filter conditions\nfiltered_df = df[(df['location'] == 'CA') & (df['height'] > 150)]\n\n# Count the number of people\ncount = len(filtered_df)\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the datatables are stored in CSV files named 'table1.csv' and 'table2.csv'. Replace these names with the actual file paths if they are different.\n\nPlease note that this code snippet is a general approach and may need modifications based on the actual data and its format."
