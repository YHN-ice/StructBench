Possible difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process could include:\n\n1. Data Completeness: Not all rows might have complete information about the work location or height.\n\n2. Data Consistency: There might be inconsistencies in how the location or height is recorded (e.g., using different units for height such as feet vs. centimeters, or different abbreviations for Illinois).\n\n3. Data Accuracy: The data provided could have inaccuracies or typos that might affect the identification of individuals working in IL or their height measurements.\n\n4. Parsing Errors: Depending on the format of the datatable, there could be challenges in correctly parsing the data due to formatting issues, such as missing delimiters or inconsistent row structure.\n\n5. Multiple Entries: Since the same primeKey refers to the same person, there may be multiple rows for individuals with updates to their information. It is necessary to ensure that each person is only counted once and that their most recent or accurate information is used.\n\n6. Ambiguous Height Threshold: We must be certain that the height threshold of 178 is inclusive or exclusive and in which unit it is expressed.\n\n7.
