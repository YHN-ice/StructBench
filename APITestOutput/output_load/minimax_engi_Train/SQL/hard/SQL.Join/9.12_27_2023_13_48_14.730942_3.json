Missing Data: There may be incomplete records for some individuals, such as missing height information or work location, which could make it impossible to include them in the count.\n\n3.

Data Parsing Errors: Parsing errors can occur if the data is complex or if there is inconsistent usage of delimiters or encodings.\n\n7.
