        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in TX are taller than 166?\", we need to filter the data based on the location (TX) and the height (greater than 166).\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Filter the data by location:**\n   Filter the data to include only rows where the person works in TX.\n\n2. **Filter the data by height:**\n   Filter the data to include only rows where the person's height is greater than 166.\n\n3. **Count the remaining rows:**\n   Count the number of rows remaining after applying both filters. This will give us the number of people who work in TX and are taller than 166.\n\nLet's apply this approach to the given data:\n\n1. Filter the data by location:\n   We have the following rows where the person works in TX:\n\n   | primeKey | gender | age | name | height | weight | color |\n   | -------- | ------ | --- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ----- |\n   | e        | male   | 13  | t    | 169    | 76     | black |\n\n2. Filter the data by height:\n   We have the following rows where the person's height is greater than 166:\n\n   | primeKey | gender | age | name | height | weight | color |\n   | -------- | ------ | --- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ----- |\n   | e        | male   | 13  | t    | 169    | 76     | black |\n\n3. Count the remaining rows:\n   We have 1 row remaining after applying both filters.\n\nSo, there is **1 person** who works in TX and is taller than 166."
