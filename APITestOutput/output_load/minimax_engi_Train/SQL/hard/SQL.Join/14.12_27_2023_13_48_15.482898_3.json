        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in TX are taller than 151?\", we need to first identify the rows where the person works in TX and then check if their height is taller than 151.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to parse the data tables and answer the question:\n\n1. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data by removing any rows with missing or inconsistent data.\n\n2. **Data Joining**: Since the data is spread across multiple rows for the same person, join the data based on the primeKey.\n\n3. **Data Conversion**: Convert the heights to a consistent unit (e.g., centimeters) and ensure the data type is numeric.\n\n4. **State Normalization**: Normalize the state names or abbreviations to ensure 'TX', 'Texas', and other variations are recognized as the same state.\n\n5. **Filtering**: Filter the rows where the person works in TX and their height is taller than 151.\n\n6. **Counting**: Count the number of people who meet the criteria.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Data cleaning\ndata = data.dropna()  # Remove rows with missing data\n\n# Data joining\ndata = data.groupby('primeKey').agg(lambda x: x.tolist())\n\n# Data conversion\ndata['height'] = data['height'].apply(lambda x: int(x.split()[0]) if x else None)\n\n# State normalization\ndata['location'] = data['location'].str.lower()\n\n# Filtering\nfiltered_data = data[(data['location'] == 'tx') & (data['height'] > 151)]\n\n# Counting\ncount = len(filtered_data)\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis code assumes the data is in a CSV file named 'data.csv' and that the heights are stored as strings with units (e.g., '182 cm').
