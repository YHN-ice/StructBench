This requires normalization for accurate comparison.\n\n5. **Duplicate Records**: If the datatable has not been properly cleaned, there could be duplicate records for the same individual, which would distort the count unless duplicates are identified and removed.\n\n6. **Sorting and Filtering**: Depending on the size of the datatable, sorting and filtering tools may need to be applied efficiently to handle large datasets without performance issues.\n\n7. **Data Interpretation**: The abbreviation \"GA\" might typically refer to Georgia, USA, but could potentially refer to other places or entities. Contextual clarity is needed.\n\n8. **Data Parsing**: It requires proper parsing of the datatable to identify the relevant columns and rows that match the criteria (working in GA and taller than 164).\n\n9. **Challenges with PrimeKey Links**: If multiple tables are used, there could be challenges linking data with the same primeKey, especially if there are any discrepancies or errors in the key values.\n\n10. **Verification of Criteria Satisfaction**: Ensuring that each row of data satisfies both the location (GA) and height (>164) criteria may require multiple verification steps.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these potential difficulties will be essential for parsing the datatables correctly and providing an accurate answer to the question."
