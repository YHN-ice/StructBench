Inconsistent data formatting: Height and location information might be formatted inconsistently, requiring normalization for proper comparison and filtering.\n\n3. Missing or incomplete data: Some records might have missing height or location information, making it difficult to determine if they meet the criteria.\n\n4. Data errors or inaccuracies: The dataset might contain errors, such as incorrect height values or incorrect state abbreviations, which could lead to inaccurate results.\n\n5. Duplicate records: There may be duplicate entries for the same person (same `primeKey`), which need to be identified and handled to avoid overcounting.\n\n6. Ambiguities in measurement units: The unit for height should be clear (e.g., centimeters vs. inches) to determine whether a person is taller than 180.\n\n7. Different interpretations of \"work in HI\": This could mean the person's office is located in Hawaii, they reside in Hawaii and work remotely for a company elsewhere, or they travel frequently to Hawaii for work.\n\n8.
