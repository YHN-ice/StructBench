        "To answer the question, we need to find the number of people who work in California (location 'CA') and are taller than 177 cm. \n\nFirst, let's check the data for any missing or inconsistent information.\n\nLooking at the data, we can see that there are no missing height or location values. However, the location is recorded in full (e.g., 'California') instead of the abbreviation 'CA'. We will need to account for this when filtering the data.\n\nNext, let's convert all heights to a consistent unit (e.g., centimeters) for comparison. Since the heights are already in centimeters, we don't need to do any conversion.\n\nNow, let's filter the data for people who work in California and are taller than 177 cm.\n\nFrom the data, we can see that there are two people who meet these criteria:\n\n- Person with primeKey 'g' is employed at Google in Georgia, but they are also retired, so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person with primeKey 'i' is retired and lives in California, but they are not employed, so they don't meet the criteria.\n\nTherefore, there are no people who work in California and are taller than 177 cm."
