Inconsistent Data Formats: If the data is not consistently formatted, especially for height and location, this could lead to challenges in filtering and comparing values.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: There may be duplicate rows with the same primeKey, which could lead to counting the same person more than once if not handled properly.\n\n4. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If a person's information is spread across multiple rows, it will be necessary to correctly associate all relevant rows to each person using the primeKey.\n\n5. Variations in Height Units: Heights could be listed in different units (inches, centimeters, etc.), and there would need to be standardization to compare them accurately.\n\n6.
