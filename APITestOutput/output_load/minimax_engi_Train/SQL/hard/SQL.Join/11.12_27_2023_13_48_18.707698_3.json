Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. Inconsistent Data: The datatable may have inconsistencies such as different formats for height (centimeters, meters, feet/inches) or location (abbreviations, full state names). Ensuring data uniformity is crucial.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some rows might be missing data for height or work location, which could lead to inaccuracies in counting people who meet the criteria.\n\n3. Multiple Entries: A person might be listed multiple times with different pieces of information in separate rows. It's important to correctly merge these rows based on the primeKey to avoid double counting.\n\n4. Incorrect Data Types: The height or location data may not be stored as numerical or string types respectively, which could complicate comparison operations.\n\n5. Large Datasets: If the datatable contains a large number of entries, performance considerations might be necessary to efficiently process the data.\n\n6. Varying Key Names: The column headers for the primeKey, height, and work location might vary, requiring identification before processing.\n\n7. Data Cleaning: The data might need to be cleaned or preprocessed, for example, removing whitespace, standardizing location names, or converting all heights to a consistent unit.\n\n8. Ambiguous Location Identifiers: If there are multiple locations with the same abbreviation (e.g., \"CA\" could mean California or Canada), additional context may be needed to ensure accuracy.\n\nIdentifying and addressing these challenges is essential for accurately parsing the datatable and providing a correct answer to the question."
