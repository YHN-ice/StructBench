Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process:\n\n1. **Data Format Consistency**: The format of the data tables should be consistent. If there are variations in how data is represented (e.g., different column names for height like \"Height\" or \"Tall\"), it could make parsing more complex.\n\n2. **Data Quality**: The accuracy of the data is crucial. Inaccurate data can lead to incorrect results. For example, heights could be recorded in different units (inches vs. centimeters), or there might be typos or missing values.\n\n3. **Multiple Entries**: If the same person has multiple entries with different information (e.g., different heights recorded at different times), it might be unclear which entry to consider.\n\n4. **Matching Records**: Since the same `primeKey` refers to the same person, we need to ensure we match records correctly using this key. Mismatches could result in double-counting or missing out on some individuals.\n\n5. **Filtering Criteria**: We need to apply two filters: location (`IL`) and height (`> 161`). Both conditions must be met for a person to be counted.\n\n6. **Unit Conversion**: If there are multiple units for height, we may need to convert all measurements to the same unit for accurate comparison.\n\n7. **Data Volume**: The size of the dataset can affect the performance of the parser. Large datasets might require more optimized algorithms to parse efficiently.\n\n8. **Data Integrity**: The tables must be joined on the correct key without any corruption of data, ensuring that all related records are properly aligned.\n\n9. **Missing Data**: If some records have missing location or height information, we will need to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n10. **Software Limitations**: The limitations of the parsing tool or programming language used might affect the ability to process the data as required.\n\nCorrectly addressing these potential obstacles is crucial for providing an accurate answer to the question."
