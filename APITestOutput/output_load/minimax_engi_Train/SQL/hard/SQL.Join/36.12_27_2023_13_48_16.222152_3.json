Merging Information: If the datatable has multiple rows with the same primeKey for the same individual, we must ensure information is correctly merged to get accurate height and workplace data.\n\n4. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows might have missing or incomplete data for the height or workplace fields, which could lead to inaccuracies if not handled correctly.\n\n5. Data Formatting: The format of the height data may vary; it might be necessary to convert units or interpret the figures correctly to determine if someone is taller than 175 cm.\n\n6. Filtering Criteria: It will be necessary to accurately filter the data based on two criteria: workplace (NY) and height (taller than 175 cm). Misinterpreting these filters could result in an incorrect count.\n\n7. Duplicate Entries: The datatable might contain duplicate entries for individuals, which would need to be identified and removed to avoid overcounting.\n\n8.
