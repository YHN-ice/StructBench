        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in TX are taller than 175?\", we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Cleaning**: First, we need to clean the data by removing any missing or incomplete records, as well as any duplicates.\n\n2. **Data Normalization**: Next, we need to normalize the data formats. For example, we need to ensure that the height data is in a consistent unit (e.g., inches) and that the state data is abbreviated consistently (e.g., \"TX\").\n\n3. **Data Joining**: If the required information is spread across multiple tables, we need to join or merge the tables based on the `primeKey` to get a complete picture of each individual.\n\n4. **Filtering**: Once the data is cleaned and normalized, we can filter the data to find individuals who work in TX and are taller than 175.\n\n5. **Counting**: Finally, we can count the number of individuals who meet both conditions.\n\nApplying these steps to the given datatables, we can see that there are 3 people who work in TX and are taller than 175:\n\n- Person with `primeKey` \"a\" is male, 11 years old, named \"e\", 190 inches tall, and 164 pounds heavy. They are retired and earn $360,287 at Apple in TX.\n- Person with `primeKey` \"d\" is male, 54 years old, named \"h\", 181 inches tall, and 132 pounds heavy. They are retired and earn $183,104 at Apple in TX.\n- Person with `primeKey` \"g\" is female, 40 years old, named \"k\", 148 inches tall, and 103 pounds heavy. They are unemployed and earn $820,483 at Twitter in TX.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is 3."
