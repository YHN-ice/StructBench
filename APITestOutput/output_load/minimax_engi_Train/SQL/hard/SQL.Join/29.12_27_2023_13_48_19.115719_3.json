Missing or Incomplete Data: If some rows are missing height information or don't indicate the state where the person works, it may be difficult to accurately count the number of people meeting the criteria.\n\n2. Data Inconsistencies: If the data pertaining to the same person (identified by a primeKey) is inconsistent across different rows, such as conflicting height information or work locations, it could complicate the parsing process.\n\n3. Non-standard Units: Heights could be listed in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches), requiring conversion to a standard unit for proper comparison.\n\n4. Data Format Variations: The way in which the state (GA) and heights are recorded may vary, which may require normalization (e.g., full state name 'Georgia' vs. abbreviation 'GA', or height listed with units vs without).\n\n5. Multiple Entries per Person: If there are multiple rows with the same primeKey but different relevant information (e.g., changes in work location or height over time), determining the most recent or relevant entry could be challenging.\n\n6. Data Sorting and Filtering: Depending on the structure of the datatable, efficiently sorting and filtering the data to extract only those individuals who work in GA and are taller than 155 might require complex queries or programming logic.\n\n7. Human Error: Manual data entry errors could lead to incorrect information being recorded, which could affect the accuracy of the results.\n\n8. Large Datasets: If the datatable is very large, it might require substantial computational resources to process, and it could be time-consuming to manually check each entry for the criteria.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful data validation, normalization, and interpretation strategies must be employed when parsing and analyzing the datatable."
