Data Spread Across Multiple Tables:\n   - If the data is spread across multiple tables with a linking key (primeKey in this case), care must be taken to correctly join or reference the data pertaining to an individual.\n\n3. Ambiguous Location Identifiers:\n   - The abbreviation \"HI\" might stand for Hawaii, but if not standardized, it could represent something else or could be a typo.\n\n4. Data Format Issues:\n   - The dataset might be in a format that is difficult to parse or interpret programmatically.\n   - Numerical data may be stored as text, requiring conversion before comparison can be made.\n\n5. Large Datasets:\n   - If the dataset is very large, it may require significant computational resources or efficient algorithms to process.\n\n6. Duplicate Records:\n   - There could be duplicate records for the same individual, which would need to be identified and handled to avoid overcounting.\n\n7.
