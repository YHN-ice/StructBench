All heights would need to be in the same unit to make accurate comparisons.\n\n2. **Location Identification**: The location of work might not be straightforwardly listed as \"HI.\" It could be listed as \"Hawaii,\" include the full address, or use different abbreviations.\n\n3. **Missing Data**: There may be missing or incomplete data for some entries, such as missing height or location information.\n\n4. **Duplicate Records**: If rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there may be duplicate records that need to be consolidated. Ensuring that each individual is only counted once is important.\n\n5. **Data Type Issues**: Heights could be stored as strings instead of numbers, which would require conversion to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n6. **Filtering Complexities**: The datatable may contain a lot of information, requiring careful filtering to isolate the relevant data (people working in HI and their heights).\n\n7. **PrimeKey Confusion**: Understanding that rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person is crucial. Ignoring this could lead to counting the same person multiple times.\n\n8. **Human Error**: Manual data parsing can lead to mistakes due to overlook or misinterpretation of the data.\n\n9. **Data Volume**: If the dataset is very large, it can be difficult to process it manually, and an automated approach may be necessary.\n\nOnce we receive the input file, we'll need to carefully manage these potential issues to accurately determine the number of people fitting the specified criteria."
