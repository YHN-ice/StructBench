This would make it impossible to determine whether some people meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Data Accuracy**: The data might contain inaccuracies or typos, such as incorrect height values or misspelled work locations.\n\n4. **Ambiguities in Location**: There could be ambiguities in the definition of \"work in NY,\" such as whether it includes remote workers who work for a NY-based company but live elsewhere, or if it strictly refers to those physically working within New York state boundaries.\n\n5. **Handling PrimeKeys**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, care must be taken to not double-count individuals when they appear in more than one row.\n\n6. **Data Interpretation**: The height threshold is given as \"taller than 159.\" This will require interpreting whether someone exactly 159 cm tall should be included or excluded from the count.\n\n7. **Data Volume**: If the dataset is particularly large, it might pose a challenge in terms of computation time and resources required to process the information.\n\n8. **Complex Query Logic**: The question requires a combination of filtering by location and a comparison operation on height.
