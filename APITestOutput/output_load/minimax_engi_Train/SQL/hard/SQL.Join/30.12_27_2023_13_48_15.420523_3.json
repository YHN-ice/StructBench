We need to standardize data for an accurate comparison.\n\n4. **Filtering Criteria**: We must apply two filters correctly: people must work in IL and be taller than 157 cm. An error in applying these filters could lead to incorrect counts.\n\n5. **Missing Data**: Some rows might have missing or incomplete information regarding work location or height, which could complicate the filtering process.\n\n6. **Data Format**: Height data might be presented in various formats (e.g., strings with units included, decimal numbers).
