Deciding how to handle such entries could affect the final count.\n\n4. **Data Formatting**: The data could be inconsistently formatted (e.g., extra spaces, varying formats for location such as \"CA\", \"California\", or misspellings). Standardizing or normalizing the data will be important for accurate filtering.\n\n5. **Performance Considerations**: If the dataset is large, there might be performance implications when parsing and filtering through the information.
