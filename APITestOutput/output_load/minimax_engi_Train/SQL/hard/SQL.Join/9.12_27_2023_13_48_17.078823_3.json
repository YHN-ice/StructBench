        "To solve this problem, we need to first join the two tables based on the primeKey and then filter out the people who work in GA and are taller than 170.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Data Joining**: Join the two tables based on the primeKey. This will give us a single table with all the required information.\n\n2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle any missing or inconsistent data. This might involve filling in missing values, converting data formats, or removing duplicate entries.\n\n3. **Data Filtering**: Filter out the people who work in GA and are taller than 170.
