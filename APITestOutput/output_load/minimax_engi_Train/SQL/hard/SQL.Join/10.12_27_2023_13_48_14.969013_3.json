        "To answer the question, we need to find the number of people who work in California (CA) and are taller than 161 cm. \n\nFirst, we need to identify the rows where the person works in California. We can do this by checking the 'location' column for entries containing 'CA'.\n\nNext, we need to find the height of these individuals and compare it to 161 cm. The heights are given in inches, so we need to convert them to centimeters (1 inch = 2.54 cm).\n\nAfter identifying the relevant rows, we can count the number of people who meet both criteria.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Filter the rows where the person works in California (location = 'CA').\n2. Convert the heights from inches to centimeters.\n3. Check if the height is greater than 161 cm.\n4. Count the number of people who meet both criteria.\n\nApplying this process to the given datatables, we find that there are 3 people who work in California and are taller than 161 cm:\n\n- Person 'b' is 192 cm tall and works in New York (NY), so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person 'c' is 127 cm tall and works in Texas (TX), so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person 'd' is 122 cm tall and is retired, so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person 'e' is 198 cm tall and is retired, so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person 'f' is 122 cm tall and works in Hawaii (HI), so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person 'g' is 217 cm tall and is retired, so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person 'h' is 213 cm tall and works in Illinois (IL), so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person 'i' is 146 cm tall and works in Georgia (GA), so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person 'j' is 139 cm tall and works in Hawaii (HI), so they don't meet the criteria.\n- Person 'k' is 1"
