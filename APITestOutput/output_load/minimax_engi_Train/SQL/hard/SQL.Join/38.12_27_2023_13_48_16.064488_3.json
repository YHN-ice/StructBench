Data Format and Consistency: The data tables might be in a format that is not standardized, leading to difficulties in parsing the data. Inconsistencies such as different units of measurement for height (centimeters, inches, feet) would need to be normalized.\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some entries may not have complete information regarding the height or work location, which would require a decision on handling such incomplete records.\n\n3. Multiple Entries per Person: If the same person has multiple entries (rows with the same primeKey), there might be conflicting or redundant information that needs to be resolved or consolidated.\n\n4. Inaccurate Data: There could be inaccuracies or typographical errors in the data, such as incorrect state codes or heights that are not plausible, which would affect the accuracy of the final count.\n\n5. Large Data Volume: If the dataset is very large, it may pose a challenge to process efficiently, especially if sorting or filtering through large numbers of records is required.\n\n6. Diverse Data Sources: The information about work location and height may come from different tables or datasets, requiring a join or merge operation based on the primeKey.\n\n7. PrimeKey Identification: Identifying and correctly using the primeKey to match records referring to the same person is crucial to avoid double counting or missing individuals.\n\n8. State Code Variations: There could be variations in how state codes are represented (full state name vs. abbreviation), which would need to be standardized to accurately filter for \"IL\".\n\n9. Data Privacy and Security: Depending on the dataset's sensitivity, there might be privacy concerns that limit the ability to fully analyze or share the data.\n\nTo address these challenges, a systematic approach to data cleaning, validation, normalization, and analysis will be essential."
