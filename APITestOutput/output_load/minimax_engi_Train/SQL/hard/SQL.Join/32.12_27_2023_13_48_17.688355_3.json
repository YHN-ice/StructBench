Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could hinder this process:\n\n1. Inconsistent Data Formats: Height might be recorded in different units or formats (e.g., centimeters, meters, feet, and inches). We need to ensure that all height data is in the same unit for comparison.\n\n2. Missing Data: There may be missing height or location data for some individuals, which could lead to inaccuracies if not handled properly.\n\n3. Data Accuracy: The data provided could contain errors or inaccuracies that would affect the outcome. For instance, typographical errors in the height or location columns could lead to incorrect counts.\n\n4. Ambiguity in Location: If the abbreviation \"GA\" refers to Georgia, we need to confirm there are no other meanings or contexts within the dataset (e.g., an abbreviation for a company name) that could cause confusion.\n\n5. Duplicate Records: If the same person's data is entered more than once with different primeKeys, it could lead to an overcount unless duplicates are identified and handled.\n\n6. Filtering Complexity: Depending on the structure of the datatable, filtering out individuals based on both their location (GA) and height (greater than 150) may require multiple steps or complex queries.\n\n7. Data Volume: If the dataset is large, performance issues might arise when parsing and filtering through the data.\n\nOnce we have the input file, it will be important to carefully address these potential issues in order to provide an accurate answer to the question."
