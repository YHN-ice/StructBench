For example, height may be recorded in different units or formats in different rows.\n\n2. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Some rows may have missing data fields such as the state of employment (GA) or height, which would make it impossible to determine whether they meet both criteria without making assumptions or looking for additional data.\n\n3. **Data Accuracy**: The data provided might contain errors or inaccuracies, which could lead to incorrect conclusions about the number of people meeting the criteria.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Location Data**: The abbreviation \"GA\" might not be specific enough if the dataset includes international data where \"GA\" could stand for something other than Georgia, or there may be multiple locations abbreviated as GA.\n\n5. **Duplicate Rows**: If the dataset contains duplicate rows for the same individual (same primeKey), care must be taken not to double-count individuals.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structures**: If the data is spread across multiple tables with relationships that need to be joined on a primeKey, it may require complex queries or data manipulation to consolidate the information.\n\n7. **Performance Issues**: If the dataset is very large, there might be performance issues that could slow down the parsing and filtering process.\n\n8. **Interpreting the Height Criterion**: Some data entries might be on the border of 166 (like 165.5) and it might not be clear whether to round up or down, or how to handle such cases.\n\nEach of these challenges would require specific strategies to overcome, such as data cleaning for consistency, handling missing values appropriately, validating data accuracy, and ensuring that the parsing script is efficient for large datasets."
