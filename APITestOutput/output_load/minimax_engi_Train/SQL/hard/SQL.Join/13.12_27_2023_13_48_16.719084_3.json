Applying Conditions:\n   - We need to filter out people who work in WA (Washington) and are taller than 179.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process to solve the problem:\n\n1. Merge the two data tables based on the primeKey.\n2. Filter out rows where the location is not WA or the height is not provided.\n3.
