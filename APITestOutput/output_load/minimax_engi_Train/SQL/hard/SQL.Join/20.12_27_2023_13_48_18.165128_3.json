Potential difficulties and obstacles might include:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Data Formats**: Height could be recorded in different units or formats (e.g., centimeters, meters, feet and inches) across different rows. A consistent unit of measurement is necessary to compare heights accurately.\n\n2. **Missing Data**: There might be missing values for height or location (TX), which would require a decision on how to handle such cases (e.g., exclude, impute, or flag them).\n\n3. **Data Errors**: Errors in data entry could lead to incorrect height values or state codes. For example, 'TX' might be misspelled or abbreviated differently.\n\n4. **Multiple Rows per Person**: Since the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there might be duplicate information or different pieces of information for the same person across rows. We would need to ensure that we don't double-count people and that we consider all relevant data for each individual.\n\n5. **Parsing and Processing Efficiency**: Depending on the size of the datatable, parsing and processing the data efficiently may be a challenge, particularly if it must be done in memory.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in \"Taller Than 160\"**: The phrase \"taller than 160\" needs clarification on whether it means strictly greater than 160 or 160 and above, and what unit of measurement is being used.\n\n7. **Data Privacy and Security**: If the datatable contains personally identifiable information (PII), there may be privacy concerns and legal restrictions regarding how the data can be processed and stored.\n\n8. **Data Types and Sorting**: Ensuring that the data types are correctly interpreted (e.g., numeric vs. string) to allow for proper sorting and comparison operations.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I will be able to better assess which of these potential difficulties apply and determine how to navigate them to provide an accurate answer."
