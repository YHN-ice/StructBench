Care must be taken not to count the same individual multiple times.\n\n4. **Missing Data**: Some entries may not have a gender specified, so it would be important to handle missing data appropriately.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity**: If the parser is case-sensitive, it may miss entries that are not in the expected case (e.g., 'female' vs 'Female').\n\n6. **Non-Binary Gender**: There might be non-binary gender options that should not be conflated with female but would need to be handled separately.\n\n7. **Large Data Volumes**: If the datatable is particularly large, performance could become an issue, and efficient methods of parsing and counting would need to be employed.\n\n8. **Complex Data Structures**: The datatable could have a complex structure with nested tables or unusual encodings.
