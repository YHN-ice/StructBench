Data Format: The salary data might not be in a numeric format, requiring conversion before comparison. For instance, salaries could be provided as strings with currency symbols or commas that need to be stripped out.\n\n3. Large Dataset: If the dataset is very large, it may require efficient filtering or querying techniques to handle the dataset without performance issues.\n\n4. Multiple Entries: There may be multiple rows with the same primeKey (indicating the same person) but with different salary figures due to data errors or updates.
