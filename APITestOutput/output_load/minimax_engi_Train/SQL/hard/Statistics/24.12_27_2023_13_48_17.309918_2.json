Encoding or Language Issues: The datatable might have encoding issues or non-English labels for gender, requiring additional steps for proper interpretation.\n\nTo address these challenges, one would need to carefully review the datatable's schema, ensure accurate parsing of gender-related columns, handle duplicates properly, deal with missing or inconsistent data appropriately, and employ efficient methods to process large datasets if necessary."
