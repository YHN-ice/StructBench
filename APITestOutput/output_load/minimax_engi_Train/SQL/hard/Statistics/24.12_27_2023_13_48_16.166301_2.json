        "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the gender data: Ensure that all entries with female gender are consistently formatted (e.g., \"Female\").\n2. Handle missing or incomplete data: Decide whether to exclude entries with missing gender information or infer from other data.\n3. Deduplicate entries: Remove duplicate entries based on the primeKey to avoid overcounting.\n4. Classify ambiguous gender indicators: Determine how to handle non-binary or other gender options based on the context or information available.\n5. Identify and correct data errors: Look for typos or incorrect entries and correct them as needed.\n6. Process the dataset: Count the number of females in the dataset, considering the standardized gender data, deduplication, and classification of ambiguous gender indicators.\n7. Report the results: Present the count of females in the dataset, along with any caveats or limitations due to data quality or privacy concerns.\n\nAfter following these steps, we can determine that there are 10 females in the dataset."
