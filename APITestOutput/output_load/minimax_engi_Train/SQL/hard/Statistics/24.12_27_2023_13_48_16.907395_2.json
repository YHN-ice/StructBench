Typos or Erroneous Entries: Data entry errors, such as typos or incorrect information, could lead to misclassification of gender.\n\n4. Multiple Rows per Individual: If the datatable has multiple rows for the same individual (same `primeKey`), it will be important not to count the same person more than once.\n\n5. Case Sensitivity: If the data parsing is case sensitive, different capitalizations (e.g., \"Female\" vs \"female\") might be counted as distinct categories.\n\n6. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: Some individuals may have non-binary or ambiguous gender indicators that do not fit into the male/female binary.\n\n7. Complex Data Structures: The data might be spread across multiple tables or files, requiring a join or a merge to piece together the relevant information.\n\n8. Large Dataset: A very large dataset could pose a challenge in terms of processing time and computational resources.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would need to ensure proper data normalization, handle missing values appropriately, deduplicate entries based on `primeKey`, and use case-insensitive search methods if needed."
