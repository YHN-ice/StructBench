Inconsistency in Data Format: If gender is recorded in multiple formats (e.g., \"F\", \"Female\", \"fem.\", etc.), it may require normalization to ensure accurate counting.\n\n2. Duplicate Entries: Multiple rows may pertain to the same individual (as indicated by the same `primeKey`). Such duplicates need to be identified and filtered out to avoid overcounting.\n\n3. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some entries may lack gender information or have null values in the gender field, complicating the count.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: Some datatables may use non-standard indicators for gender or include additional gender categories beyond male and female, which would need to be considered in the count.\n\n5. Data Entry Errors: Typos or incorrect data entry could misrepresent the gender of individuals, leading to inaccurate counts.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: The case of letters in text fields (e.g., \"female\" vs. \"Female\") could affect text-based searches unless handled properly.\n\n7. Large Datasets: A very large dataset could pose technical challenges in terms of processing time and memory usage.\n\n8. Nested or Complex Data Structures: If the datatable has a complex structure, such as nested tables or non-flat design, extracting the necessary information could be more challenging.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would typically need to preprocess the data to normalize gender representations, identify and remove duplicate entries based on the `primeKey`, handle missing or incomplete records appropriately, consider all possible gender indicators, correct any identifiable data entry errors, implement case-insensitive search mechanisms, and use efficient parsing techniques to handle potentially large datasets with complex structures."
