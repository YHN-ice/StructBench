Data Size and Format: If the datatable is large and not properly formatted, it can be challenging to process the data efficiently.\n\n2. Data Consistency: If the salary information is not consistently entered (e.g., different currencies, typos, or different formats like \"37,3681\" vs. \"373681\"), it might lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. Duplicate Records: If the datatable contains duplicate records for the same person (same primeKey), it is essential to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n4. Missing Data: Some rows may have missing or incomplete salary information, which could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n5. Data Interpretation: The datatable may contain additional information that requires interpretation, such as part-time versus full-time employment status, which could affect how salaries are compared.\n\n6. Sorting and Filtering: Efficiently sorting and filtering the datatable to isolate the rows with salaries greater than 373681 will be crucial in obtaining an accurate count.\n\n7. Data Types: Ensuring that salary data is treated as numerical values rather than strings will be necessary for proper comparison.\n\nIt's important to address these obstacles by applying appropriate data parsing and processing techniques such as data cleaning, deduplication, type conversion, and using conditional statements to filter and count the relevant records."
