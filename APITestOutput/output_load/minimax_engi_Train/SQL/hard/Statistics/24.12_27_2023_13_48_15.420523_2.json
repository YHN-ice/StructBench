This might involve converting all gender identifiers to a standard format (e.g., \"F\" for female, \"M\" for male) and handling any missing or ambiguous identifiers.\n\n3. **Count Females**: Once the gender data is normalized, we can count the number of rows where the gender is \"F\" or \"female\".\n\n4. **Handle Duplicate Entries**: If there are multiple rows per person, we need to ensure that we count each person only once.
