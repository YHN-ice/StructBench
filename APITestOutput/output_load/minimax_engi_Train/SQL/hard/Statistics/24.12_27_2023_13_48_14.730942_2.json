        "To count the number of females in the given datatable, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Cleaning**: First, we need to clean the data by removing any rows with missing or null gender values. This will ensure that our count is based on complete and valid data.\n\n2. **Data Standardization**: Next, we need to standardize the gender entries. This could involve converting all entries to lowercase or a consistent abbreviation (e.g., \"f\" for female). This will help ensure that all female entries are counted accurately, regardless of how they are entered in the dataset.\n\n3. **Duplicate Handling**: Since the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we need to handle duplicates appropriately. We can either count each duplicate row as a separate individual (if the data is not consistent across rows for the same person) or ignore duplicates (if the data is consistent across rows for the same person).\n\n4. **Data Extraction**: Once the data is cleaned and standardized, we can extract the gender entries for each individual.
