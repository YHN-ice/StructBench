Missing Data: Some rows might have missing or null values in the gender column, complicating the count unless there's a way to infer gender from other data.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: If the datatable has duplicate rows (with the same primeKey) but inconsistent gender information, it could lead to double-counting or confusion about the actual gender.\n\n4. Data Errors: There might be typos or incorrect entries in the gender field, which would require validation or correction before an accurate count can be determined.\n\n5. Large Datasets: If the datatable is very large, it might pose performance issues and require efficient parsing methods to process the data within a reasonable time frame.\n\n6. Multiple Tables: If the gender information is spread across multiple tables linked by a primeKey, this would necessitate joining tables or correlating entries accurately.\n\n7. Ambiguous Gender Identifiers: In some cases, the gender might not be clearly defined, or the datatable might include non-binary or other gender identities that do not fit into a binary \"female\" category.\n\n8.
