        "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the data into a DataFrame.\n2. Check for any missing or null values in the gender column.\n3. Normalize the gender data to a consistent format (e.g., \"F\" for female, \"M\" for male).\n4. Count the number of rows where the gender is \"F\".\n5. Ensure that we do not count the same individual multiple times by considering the primeKey.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements these steps using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Check for missing or null values in the gender column\nmissing_values = df['gender'].isnull().sum()\n\n# Normalize the gender data to a consistent format\ndf['gender'] = df['gender'].str.lower()\ndf['gender'] = df['gender'].replace(['f', 'female', 'woman'], 'f')\ndf['gender'] = df['gender'].replace(['m', 'male', 'man'], 'm')\n\n# Count the number of rows where the gender is \"F\"\nfemale_count = df[df['gender'] == 'f'].shape[0]\n\n# Ensure that we do not count the same individual multiple times by considering the primeKey\nunique_females = df[df['gender'] == 'f'].drop_duplicates('primeKey').shape[0]\n\nprint(unique_females)\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the gender information is in the 'gender' column and that the primeKey is unique for each individual. If the column names or the structure of the data are different, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly."
