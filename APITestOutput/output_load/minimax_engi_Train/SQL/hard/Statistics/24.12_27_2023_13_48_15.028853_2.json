Duplication: If the table does not have a clear primary key or if the primary key is not unique, there could be duplicate entries for the same individual that could lead to overcounting.\n\n5. Composite Keys: If the primary key is a composite key consisting of multiple columns, it might be more complex to identify unique individuals.\n\n6. Multiple Tables: If the data about gender is spread across multiple tables that need to be joined using a primary key, there could be complications in merging the tables correctly.\n\n7.
