        "To solve this problem, we will first need to extract the salary information from the second table and then compare it to the threshold value of 760753. We will also need to ensure that we are only counting unique individuals, as there may be multiple rows with the same primeKey.\n\nHere is a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. Parse the second table to extract the salary information.\n2. Convert the salary information to a numeric data type if necessary.\n3. Filter out the rows where the salary is greater than 760753.\n4. Count the unique primeKeys in the filtered rows.\n\nLet's apply this approach to the given data:\n\n1. Extract the salary information:\n   ```\n   [309162, 652025, 699392, 788621, 188198, 272024, 943522, 732247, 676064, 139741]\n   ```\n\n2. Convert the salary information to a numeric data type:\n   ```\n   [309162, 652025, 699392, 788621, 188198, 272024, 943522, 732247, 676064, 139741]\n   ```\n   All salaries are already numeric.\n\n3. Filter out the rows where the salary is greater than 760753:\n   ```\n   [652025, 699392, 788621, 943522, 732247, 676064]\n   ```\n\n4. Count the unique primeKeys in the filtered rows:\n   ```\n   [b, c, d, g, h, i]\n   ```\n\nSo, there are 6 people with salaries greater than 760753."
