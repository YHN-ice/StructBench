Inconsistencies like different currency formats or inclusion of non-numeric characters could complicate the parsing process.\n\n2. **Data Quality and Accuracy**: The datatable might contain errors or inaccuracies such as typos in the salary figures, which could lead to incorrect calculations or classifications of individuals' salaries.\n\n3. **Complex Data Structure**: If the datatable has a complex structure, such as multiple tables that need to be joined or data spread across different sheets or files, it can complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Column Identification**: Identifying the correct column that contains the salary information is crucial. There could be multiple columns with financial figures, and selecting the wrong one would lead to incorrect answers.\n\n5. **Handling Large Volumes of Data**: If the datatable contains a large number of records, this could pose a performance issue, requiring efficient parsing algorithms to handle the data without excessive processing time.\n\n6. **Duplicate Records**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, care must be taken to ensure that each person is only counted once, even if they appear in multiple records.\n\n7. **Data Types and Conversion**: Salaries might be recorded as text instead of numbers, necessitating conversion before any numerical comparison can be made.\n\n8. **Filtering Logic**: The logic to filter salaries greater than 48941 needs to be accurate and robust to ensure correct results.\n\n9. **Currency Considerations**: If the dataset includes international salaries, differences in currency might need to be normalized to a single currency before comparison.\n\n10. **Updating Knowledge**: If any new data has been added after my knowledge cut-off date, I won't be aware of it. Thus, I won't be able to incorporate any changes in standard practices or data formatting that have occurred since then.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles will help in preparing an effective strategy to parse the datatable and extract the required information accurately."
