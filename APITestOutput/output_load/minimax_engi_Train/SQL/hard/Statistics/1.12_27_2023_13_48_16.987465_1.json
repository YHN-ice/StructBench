Ensuring that each person is counted only once, even if they appear in multiple rows, will be important.\n\n3. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: If any rows are missing salary information or the data table is not fully provided, it may not be possible to accurately determine who has a salary above the specified threshold.\n\n4. **Data Sorting and Filtering**: The datatable will need to be sorted or filtered to identify individuals with salaries greater than 315866.

Efficient parsing and searching algorithms would be needed to handle big data without significant delays.\n\n6. **Data Integrity and Accuracy**: The correctness of the provided data is crucial.
