This would require normalization before comparison.\n\n2. **Data Inconsistencies**: If the datatable has inconsistent data entries for salaries or includes null or missing values, it could lead to inaccurate counts.\n\n3. **Multiple Entries for Individuals**: The same person might have multiple rows in the table (as indicated by the same `primeKey`). One must be careful to only count each individual once.\n\n4. **Large Data Volume**: If the datatable is very large, it may pose computational performance issues or require efficient parsing algorithms to manage the resources effectively.\n\n5. **Data Privacy and Security**: Salary information is sensitive. Depending on the context, there may be privacy considerations when accessing and processing this data.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: The parser must be robust enough to handle errors or unexpected data formats without crashing or giving incorrect results.\n\n7. **Inaccurate Prime Keys**: If the prime keys are not unique or accurately assigned, it may result in an incorrect count of individuals.\n\n8. **Software and Hardware Limitations**: The parser's performance might also be limited by the software (e.g., programming language constraints, database capabilities) or hardware it runs on, especially with large datasets.\n\n9. **Text Encoding Issues**: If the datatable contains international characters or has been encoded in a particular way, there may be challenges in correctly parsing and interpreting the data.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges can help us prepare more thorough data validation, cleaning methods, and efficient algorithms for parsing and analyzing the datatable."

        "To solve this problem, we will first need to extract the salary data from the table and then filter out the entries where the salary is greater than 900208. We will also need to ensure that we are counting unique individuals by using the primeKey as a reference.\n\nHere is a Python solution using pandas, a popular data manipulation library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data into a pandas DataFrame\ndata = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  # Assuming the data is in a CSV file\n\n# Extract the salary data and filter out entries where salary is greater than 900208\nsalaries = data[data['salary'] > 900208]\n\n# Count unique individuals by primeKey\nunique_individuals = salaries['primeKey'].nunique()\n\nprint(unique_individuals)\n```\n\nThis script assumes that the data is stored in a CSV file named 'data.csv'. If the data is stored in a different format or location, the `read_csv` function will need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThis solution handles the potential difficulties and obstacles mentioned earlier by using pandas' built-in data manipulation and cleaning functions. It also ensures that each individual is counted only once by using the `nunique` function, which counts the number of unique values in a Series."
