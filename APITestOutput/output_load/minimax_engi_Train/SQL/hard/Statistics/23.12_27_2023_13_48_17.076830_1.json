Salaries might be presented with different currency symbols, decimal separators, or without proper thousand separators.\n\n2. **Large Data Volume**: Sifting through a large volume of data could be time-consuming, and ensuring accuracy can be challenging.\n\n3. **Data Integrity Issues**: The dataset may contain duplicates, missing values, or errors that need to be identified and handled appropriately.\n\n4. **Complex Data Structures**: If the dataset is structured in a complex manner, with multiple nested tables or indirect references, extracting the relevant information can be difficult.\n\n5. **Data Split Across Rows**: Sometimes, information about a single entity (in this case, a person) can be split across multiple rows with a common key. It requires careful aggregation to ensure data pertaining to a single entity is correctly collated before analysis.\n\n6. **Variability in Salary Representation**: Salaries might be represented in different currencies or periodic terms (annual vs monthly vs weekly). Converting these to a common base for comparison would be necessary.\n\n7. **Data Privacy and Access Restrictions**: There might be privacy concerns and access restrictions related to salary data that could limit the ability to analyze it.\n\n8. **Technical Limitations**: The tools or systems used for parsing and analyzing the datatable might have technical limitations in terms of processing power, memory capacity, or functionality that could impede analysis.\n\n9. **Ambiguous PrimeKeys**: If primeKeys are not unique or there are ambiguities in their assignment, this could lead to incorrect aggregation of data for individuals.\n\n10. **Incorrect Assumptions**: Assuming certain conditions without confirming them (e.g., assuming all salaries are annual when some might be monthly) could lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n\nIt's important to approach the datatable with these potential obstacles in mind and ensure that the parsing and analysis methods are robust enough to handle these challenges."
