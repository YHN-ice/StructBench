        "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the rows where the gender is female. We can do this by checking the 'gender' column for entries that match the string 'female'.\n\n2. Next, we need to handle the potential issue of multiple entries per person. Since we are given a 'primeKey' column that uniquely identifies each person, we can use this to ensure we don't double-count individuals. We can create a set to store the primeKeys of the females we have already counted.\n\n3. After identifying the females and handling multiple entries, we can simply count the number of unique primeKeys in our set to get the total number of females.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfemales = set()\n\nfor row in data:\n    if row['gender'] == 'female':\n        females.add(row['primeKey'])\n\nprint(len(females))\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the 'gender' column contains strings that can be directly compared with 'female'. If the gender information is encoded differently or contains typos, additional error handling or data cleaning steps might be necessary."
