        "To solve this problem, we need to extract the salary data from the datatable and then count the number of people with a salary greater than 542794.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Load the datatable into a DataFrame.\n2. Extract the salary data from the DataFrame.\n3. Convert the salary data to a numerical format (if necessary).\n4. Filter out the rows where the salary is greater than 542794.\n5. Count the number of unique primeKeys in the filtered DataFrame.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python and pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the datatable into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Extract the salary data\nsalary_data = df['salary']\n\n# Convert the salary data to a numerical format\nsalary_data = pd.to_numeric(salary_data, errors='coerce')\n\n# Filter out the rows where the salary is greater than 542794\nfiltered_df = df[salary_data > 542794]\n\n# Count the number of unique primeKeys in the filtered DataFrame\ncount = filtered_df['primeKey'].nunique()\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis script will output the number of people with a salary greater than 542794. Note that this script assumes that the datatable is in CSV format and that the 'primeKey' and 'salary' columns exist in the datatable. If the datatable is in a different format or the column names are different, the script will need to be adjusted accordingly."
