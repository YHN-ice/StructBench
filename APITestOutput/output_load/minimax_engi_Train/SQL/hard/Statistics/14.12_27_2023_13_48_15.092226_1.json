Inconsistent Data: If there are inconsistencies in how salaries are reported (e.g., some entries are annual, while others are monthly), it could lead to incorrect conclusions unless standardized.\n\n3. Missing or Incomplete Data: If salary information is missing for some rows, we need to decide how to handle these cases—whether to exclude them from the count or make assumptions based on available data.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: If the data table contains duplicate rows (rows with the same primeKey), we need to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n5. Data Size: If the dataset is very large, performance considerations may come into play when processing the data to count the number of people.\n\n6.
