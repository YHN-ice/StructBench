Variations in notation (e.g., \"Female\", \"F\", \"f\", \"woman\") could complicate the parsing process.\n\n2. **Data Formatting:** If the dataset is not uniformly formatted or contains errors (e.g., missing values, typos), it might be challenging to accurately determine gender.\n\n3. **Large Data Volume:** A very large dataset could pose performance issues, requiring efficient parsing algorithms to process the data in a reasonable timeframe.\n\n4. **Column Identification:** The dataset might have multiple columns, and without proper headers or explanation, identifying which column represents gender might be difficult.\n\n5. **Duplicate Entries:** Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there could be duplicate entries for an individual. Care must be taken to only count each person once.\n\n6. **Data Privacy and Sensitivity:** Gender data is often sensitive. The parser must handle it with respect, ensuring that no privacy laws or considerations are violated in the parsing and reporting process.\n\n7. **Complex Data Structures:** If the dataset is nested or contains complex structures, additional parsing logic may be needed to extract the gender information.\n\n8. **Non-binary Gender Representation:** The dataset may include non-binary or other gender representations that need to be considered separately if the question specifically asks for \"female\" individuals.\n\n9. **Incomplete Records:** Some records may be incomplete or partially missing, which could lead to an inaccurate count if not handled correctly.\n\n10. **Data Access and Permissions:** There may be restrictions on accessing or processing the data due to permission settings or data governance policies.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we'll address these obstacles as needed to provide an accurate count of the number of females in the dataset."
