        "To solve this problem, we need to parse the datatables and count the number of people with a salary greater than 674045. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the datatables to extract the relevant information (primeKey, salary).\n2. Ensure that salary data is in a consistent format and convert it to a numerical type if necessary.\n3. Handle missing or incomplete data by either excluding those rows or using a method to infer the missing data.\n4. Identify and handle duplicate entries by counting each person only once.\n5. Count the number of people with a salary greater than 674045.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements these steps:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the datatables into DataFrames\ndf_people = pd.read_csv('people.csv')\ndf_salaries = pd.read_csv('salaries.csv')\n\n# Merge the DataFrames on 'primeKey'\nmerged_df = pd.merge(df_people, df_salaries, on='primeKey')\n\n# Convert 'salary' to a numerical type and handle any errors\nmerged_df['salary'] = pd.to_numeric(merged_df['salary'], errors='coerce')\n\n# Count the number of people with a salary greater than 674045\ncount = merged_df[merged_df['salary'] > 674045].shape[0]\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the datatables are stored in CSV files named 'people.csv' and 'salaries.csv'. The 'primeKey' column is used to merge the two tables. The 'salary' column is converted to a numerical type, and any errors during conversion are handled by setting them to NaN. Finally, the number of people with a salary greater than 674045 is counted and printed.\n\nPlease note that this code snippet is a simple example and might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and content of the datatables."
