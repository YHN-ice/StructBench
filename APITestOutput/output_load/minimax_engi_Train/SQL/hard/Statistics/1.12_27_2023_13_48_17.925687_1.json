        "To answer the question, we need to parse the datatables and filter out the people with salaries greater than 963994. \n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to tackle this problem:\n\n1. Parse the datatables: First, we need to read and parse the datatables. We can use libraries like pandas in Python to read the CSV files and create DataFrames for easier manipulation.\n\n2. Clean and preprocess the data: Next, we need to clean and preprocess the data. This may involve removing any duplicate entries, handling missing or null values, and converting the salary data to a consistent format (e.g., removing currency symbols, commas, decimal points, or scientific notation).\n\n3. Filter the data: After preprocessing the data, we can filter out the rows where the salary is greater than 963994. We can use the 'primeKey' column to ensure that we count each person only once, even if they have multiple entries in the datatables.\n\n4. Count the number of people: Finally, we can count the number of unique 'primeKey' values in the filtered DataFrame to get the answer to the question.\n\nHere's a sample Python code snippet that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the datatables into DataFrames\ndf_people = pd.read_csv('people.csv')\ndf_salaries = pd.read_csv('salaries.csv')\n\n# Merge the two DataFrames on 'primeKey'\nmerged_df = pd.merge(df_people, df_salaries, on='primeKey')\n\n# Preprocess the data (e.g., remove currency symbols, commas, decimal points, or scientific notation)\n# This step depends on the specific format of the salary data\n\n# Filter the data to include only people with salaries greater than 963994\nfiltered_df = merged_df[merged_df['salary'] > 963994]\n\n# Count the number of unique 'primeKey' values in the filtered DataFrame\nnum_people = filtered_df['primeKey'].nunique()\n\nprint(num_people)\n```\n\nThis code snippet assumes that the salary data is"
