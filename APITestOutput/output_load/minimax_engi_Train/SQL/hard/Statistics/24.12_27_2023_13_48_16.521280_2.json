Inconsistent or Missing Gender Data:\n   - The gender column may not be consistently labeled (e.g., \"F\", \"Female\", \"fem\", etc.).\n   - Some rows might have missing gender information.\n\n2. Multiple Rows Per Person:\n   - If the datatable includes multiple rows for the same person (indicated by a primeKey), care must be taken to count each person only once.\n\n3. Data Errors:\n   - The dataset might contain errors such as typos or incorrect entries in the gender field.\n\n4. Ambiguous or Non-binary Gender Entries:\n   - There might be non-binary gender entries which don't fit into traditional male/female categories.\n   - Ambiguity in the gender column due to non-standardized entries.\n\n5. Large Dataset Size:\n   - If the dataset is very large, it may require efficient parsing methods to process the data quickly.\n\n6. Format of Data:\n   - The data might be in a format that is not easily parsed (e.g., PDF, images of tables, etc.)\n   - Inconsistencies in formatting across different parts of the table.\n\n7. Encoding Issues:\n   - The file containing the datatable might have encoding issues that obscure or corrupt the gender information.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it is important to:\n- Define clear criteria for identifying female entries.\n- Ensure that each individual is counted once by checking against the primeKey.\n- Develop robust data cleaning and validation processes.\n- Implement logic to handle non-binary and ambiguous gender entries appropriately.\n- Use efficient data parsing techniques for large datasets.\n- Handle various data formats and encoding properly to ensure accurate data extraction."
