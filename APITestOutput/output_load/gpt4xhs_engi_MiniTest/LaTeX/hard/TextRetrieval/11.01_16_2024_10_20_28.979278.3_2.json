They can also omit file extensions, making it harder to identify the file type.\n\n3. **Comments**: The LaTeX file might contain comments (`%` sign) that include lines which look like figure inclusion commands, but are actually commented out and should not be considered.\n\n4. **Optional arguments**: The figure inclusion commands might have optional arguments that can include additional square brackets `[ ]` before the file name; these need to be handled correctly to extract the actual file name.\n\n5. **Multiple files in one command**: Sometimes, a single `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple files, separated by commas, especially when using certain packages or custom commands.\n\n6. **Custom commands and environments**: If the document defines custom commands or environments to include figures, these need to be identified and parsed accordingly.\n\n7. **File name with spaces or special characters**: File names that include spaces or special characters may cause parsing errors if not handled properly.\n\n8. **LaTeX Packages**: The use of specific LaTeX packages can change the syntax for including figures or may provide additional ways to include graphics that need to be accounted for.\n\nBefore parsing, it is essential to consider these potential issues and ensure the parser is robust enough to handle such variations and edge cases."
