The parser must recognize all possible commands that can include figure files.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity:** The included figure files may have simple names, or they could include relative or absolute paths, with directories separated by slashes. The parser must correctly identify the full path or file name.\n\n3. **File Extensions:** Some LaTeX commands might include the file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`), while others may omit it, expecting LaTeX to automatically find the correct file. The parser should handle both cases.\n\n4. **Command Options:** The `\\includegraphics` command often includes options inside square brackets before the file name, such as `\\includegraphics[width=3cm]{image.png}`. The parser must ignore these options and only extract the file name.\n\n5. **Comments:** LaTeX comments start with `%` and extend to the end of the line. If a figure inclusion command is commented out, it should not be counted as an included figure file.\n\n6. **Figure Environments:** Figures are often wrapped inside a `figure` environment. However, the actual file inclusion might be nested within other commands or environments within the `figure` environment.\n\n7. **Complex Macros:** Some LaTeX documents define custom macros that internally include figures. These macros can vary widely between documents, making it difficult to parse without knowledge of the specific macro definitions used in the document.\n\n8. **Conditional Inclusions:** LaTeX can conditionally include content based on certain conditions using `\\if` commands or similar constructs. The parser would need to evaluate these conditions to determine if a figure is actually included.\n\n9. **Multiple Figures in One Command:** It's possible to include multiple figures with one command using loops or custom-defined commands, which complicates the parsing process.\n\nEach of these issues represents potential hurdles that would need to be handled by a LaTeX file parser aiming to accurately extract figure file names."
