Identifying all these variations requires a comprehensive approach.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold commands can be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Brace Matching**: The `\\textbf{}` command encloses the bold text within curly braces `{}`. Accurately extracting the content requires correctly pairing opening and closing braces, which can be tricky if braces are used within the bold text for other purposes.\n\n4. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX start with `%` and should be ignored by the parser. Bold text within comments should not be extracted.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Special characters, like the backslash `\\`, might be escaped within the text, potentially causing misinterpretation if not handled properly.\n\n6. **Conditional Statements**: LaTeX allows for conditional statements that can change how text is formatted. These may affect whether text is presented as bold or not.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Environments**: If the LaTeX file defines custom commands or environments to handle bold text, these need to be accounted for.\n\n8. **Split Text**: Sometimes, the text meant to be bold might be split across lines or separated by other commands, making extraction non-trivial.\n\nNow, let's move on to the input to extract the bold texts accordingly."
