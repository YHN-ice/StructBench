Identifying all the possible ways bold can be applied is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold commands could be nested within other commands or environments, which complicates the extraction process.\n\n3. **Brace Matching**: Since LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to delineate the scope of commands, accurate parsing requires keeping track of nested braces to ensure that the beginning and end of the bolded text are correctly identified.\n\n4. **Text Concatenation**: Bold text might be broken up over multiple lines or concatenated with non-bold text, requiring careful handling to extract only the bold portions.\n\n5. **Comments and Unused Code**: LaTeX files may include comments (with `%`) or commented out code that includes bold commands which should not be considered part of the actual document content.\n\n6. **Custom Macros and Styles**: The LaTeX file may define custom macros that change how bold text is represented, making it harder to identify without understanding the macro definitions.\n\n7. **Conditional Compilation**: Parts of the LaTeX document might be conditionally compiled (e.g., with `\\if... \\fi` constructs), which could affect whether text appears in bold in the final document.\n\nThese are just a few of the potential issues that might be encountered.
