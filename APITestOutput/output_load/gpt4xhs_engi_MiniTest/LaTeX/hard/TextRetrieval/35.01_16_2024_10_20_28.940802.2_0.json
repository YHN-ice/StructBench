These environments need to be identified and handled accordingly.\n\n6. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX commands often use braces `{}` to enclose the text that should be formatted. Properly matching opening and closing braces is essential for correct extraction.\n\n7. **Multi-Line Text**: Bold text could span multiple lines, which necessitates handling line breaks and whitespace correctly.\n\n8. **Partial Formatting**: Only a part of the text within a line or paragraph might be bold, which means that individual words or phrases need to be identified as bold rather than entire lines or paragraphs.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the parsing process would have to be carefully designed to manage these complexities and accurately extract the bold text from the LaTeX file."
