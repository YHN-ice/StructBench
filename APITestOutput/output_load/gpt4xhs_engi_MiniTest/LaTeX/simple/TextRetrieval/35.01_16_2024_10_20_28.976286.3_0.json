For example, bold text might be within a section heading or inside a list.\n\n4. **Custom Styling**: Some documents might define their own custom styling commands that internally use the standard bold commands. This would require parsing these custom commands as well.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments in the text that are not rendered in the final document.
