Different file paths: Figures can be included from different directories, and the file paths can be absolute or relative.

File extensions: Sometimes LaTeX files include the figure file extension (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf), and other times they do not. You need to handle both cases.\n\n4. Multiple figures in one command: Some LaTeX commands allow for including multiple figures within a single command (e.g., using subfigures). Parsing such commands correctly can be tricky.\n\n5. Commented out lines: LaTeX files may contain comments (lines starting with `%`). Such lines should not be parsed as they are not part of the actual document content.\n\n6.

Custom commands or environments: Users might define their own commands or environments for including figures, which could make it harder to identify without knowledge of those customizations.\n\n8. Bracket matching: LaTeX uses curly brackets `{}` to delineate the arguments for commands, and brackets might be nested, so proper bracket matching is necessary to extract the correct file name.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a comprehensive understanding of LaTeX syntax and careful parsing to ensure that only the relevant filenames are extracted correctly."
