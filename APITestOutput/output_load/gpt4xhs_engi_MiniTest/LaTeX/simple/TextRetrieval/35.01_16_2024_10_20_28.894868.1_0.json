The parser must recognize all these patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Commands:** Bold text in LaTeX can contain other formatting commands inside it. For example, `\\textbf{This is \\emph{important}}`. The parser should be able to handle nested commands without breaking the extraction.\n\n3. **Comments and Inactive Code:** Comments in LaTeX start with `%` and should not be considered when extracting text. Similarly, code that is commented out or not active should be ignored.\n\n4. **Custom Commands and Environments:** LaTeX might have custom commands defined using `\\newcommand` or environments that change the text to bold. The parser needs to identify these if they are used to format bold text.\n\n5. **Conditional Texts:** Sometimes, text is conditionally made bold using LaTeX if-else constructs. Parsing might need to evaluate these conditions or at least recognize different branches.\n\n6. **Split Arguments:** A bold command's argument might be split across lines or contain line breaks, which can complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Robust Parsing:** A robust parser should handle unexpected inputs without crashing, such as malformed commands or missing braces.\n\nIf you provide the LaTeX file, I can proceed to identify and extract the bold texts while considering the above challenges."
