        "To find out the number of people who work in GA (Georgia) and are taller than 167 cm, we need to filter and process the given data. From the provided input which seems to represent two tables joined by a `primeKey` column, we can identify individuals who work in GA by looking at the `location` column in the second table. Once we have this list, we can then cross-reference their heights from the first table and count those who are taller than 167 cm.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the required count:\n\n1. Identify individuals who work in GA:\n   - From the second table, filter rows where `location` is 'GA'.\n   - The primeKeys for these individuals are: h, m, o (Meta in GA), and j (NVIDIA in GA).\n\n2. Check heights of individuals who work in GA:\n   - From the first table, check the `height` column for these primeKeys: h, m, o, and j.\n   - The heights are as follows: h (207 cm), m (161 cm), o (135 cm), and j (161 cm).\n\n3. Count how many of these individuals are taller than 167 cm:\n   - From the heights we have, only one individual with primeKey h is taller than 167 cm with a height of 207 cm.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided data, there is only 1 person who works in GA and is taller than 167 cm."
