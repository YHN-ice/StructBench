Data Format Consistency: The data might not be formatted consistently. For example, the height could be in different units (feet/inches vs centimeters) or listed with varying decimal places.\n\n2. Missing Data: There could be missing entries for height or location, making it challenging to accurately assess who meets the criteria.\n\n3. Duplication: Individuals might be listed more than once if the database has duplicate entries, which can lead to an incorrect count unless the data is properly cleaned.\n\n4. Inconsistent Location Representation: The location \"CA\" might be represented differently in the dataset (e.g., \"California,\" \"Calif.,\" \"CA,\" etc.), which requires careful parsing to ensure all relevant entries are counted.\n\n5. Merging Data: If the dataset is split across multiple tables with a common key (primeKey), there could be challenges in merging the information correctly to ascertain each person's height and work location.\n\n6. Data Size and Performance: Depending on the size of the dataset, performance issues might arise, especially if the data is not indexed or if inefficient algorithms are used for parsing.\n\n7. Data Integrity: There could be errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as illogical height values (e.g., extremely high or low numbers) or incorrect location codes, which would need to be addressed or filtered out.\n\n8. Textual Ambiguity: There might be ambiguities in text fields if they are not standardized (e.g., CA not clearly referring to California).\n\n9. Complex Join Logic: If the information about height and work location are in different tables joined by a primeKey, ensuring accurate joins without creating false matches or missing key data points is crucial.\n\n10. Interpretation of \"Taller Than\": The requirement to find people \"taller than 154\" could introduce edge cases at exactly 154 cm—whether to include them or not would need clarification.\n\nOnce we have access to the actual dataset, we can devise strategies to overcome these potential obstacles to ensure the accuracy of our findings."
