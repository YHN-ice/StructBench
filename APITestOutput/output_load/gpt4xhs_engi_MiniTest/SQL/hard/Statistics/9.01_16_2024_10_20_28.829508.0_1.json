Data format: Salaries could be formatted inconsistently (e.g., as integers, floats with different precision, or strings with currency symbols). Ensuring all salary data is in a consistent numeric format is necessary for accurate comparison.\n\n3. Large datasets: If the datatable is very large, computational efficiency may become an issue. Efficient querying, filtering, or sorting methods may be needed to handle the data effectively.\n\n4.

        "Based on the input provided, which lists individuals along with their employment status and salary, we can determine the number of people with salaries greater than 122,853 by simply counting the entries in the salary column where the salary exceeds this number.\n\nGiven the input data, it appears to be in a structured format, with salaries under the \"salary\" column and employment status under the \"status\" column. Assuming that each row represents a unique individual (as per the unique 'primeKey'), we need to count how many of these individuals have a \"salary\" value greater than 122,853.\n\nLet's do the count:\n\n1. **a**: employed, 327121 (greater than 122853)\n2. **b**: retired, 818414 (greater than 122853)\n3. **c**: retired, 908555 (greater than 122853)\n4. **d**: employed, 123293 (greater than 122853)\n5. **e**: retired, 674757 (greater than 122853)\n6. **f**: unemployed, not considered for salary count\n7. **g**: employed, 724784 (greater than 122853)\n8. **h**: employed, 228506 (greater than 122853)\n9. **i**: employed, 760563 (greater than 122853)\n10. **j**: unemployed, not considered for salary count\n11. **k**: retired, 780071 (greater than 122853)\n12. **l**: employed, 704781 (greater than 122853)\n13. **m**: employed, 67780 (not greater than 122853)\n14. **n**: employed, 764386 (greater than 122853)\n15. **o**: retired, 756590 (greater than 122853)\n\nFrom this list, we exclude those who are unemployed from the salary count since they do not have a current salary to consider.
