Data Formatting: The height could be recorded in different units (such as inches or meters instead of centimeters), requiring conversion to maintain consistency.\n\n3. PrimeKey Duplication: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we need to ensure that we count each person only once, even if they appear in multiple rows.\n\n4.
