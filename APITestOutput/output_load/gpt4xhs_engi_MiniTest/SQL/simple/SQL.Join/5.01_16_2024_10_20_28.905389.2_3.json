Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. Data Inconsistency: If the data is not consistently formatted, this could make it difficult to accurately parse and compare the necessary information.\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: If some rows are missing relevant information, such as the state where a person works or their height, it could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n3. Ambiguous Location Abbreviations: There might be ambiguity in state abbreviations, especially if the data contains international entries. \"IL\" typically stands for Illinois, but ensuring that no other location codes are conflicting is important.\n\n4. Multiple Entries per Person: Since the same primeKey indicates the same person, we need to make sure we're not double-counting individuals who have multiple entries.\n\n5. Units of Height: Assuming that height is measured in centimeters could lead to incorrect conclusions if some entries use different units (such as inches). We need to ensure that height is consistently measured in centimeters.\n\n6. Data Parsing Errors: Incorrectly parsing the datatables due to formatting issues or errors in the parsing script can result in incorrect data analysis.\n\n7. Large Data Volume: If the datatables are very large, it may be computationally intensive to process them, and we might have to consider performance optimization techniques.\n\nOvercoming these challenges will require careful data validation, cleanup, and parsing before we can accurately determine how many people meet the specified criteria."

        "Based on the provided data, none of the individuals listed are employed in IL (Illinois), as there are no entries with the location set to IL. Therefore, despite the heights of certain individuals being over 173 cm (e.g., individuals with primeKeys 'b', 'e'), they do not meet the location criterion set in the question.\n\nSo, as per the data given, the answer is zero—there are no people who work in IL and are taller than 173 cm."
