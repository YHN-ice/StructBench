Data Formatting: If the salary data is not consistently formatted (e.g., use of commas, decimal points, or currency symbols), it may require preprocessing to ensure accurate comparisons.\n\n2. Large Dataset: If the datatable includes a large number of entries, it may be computationally intensive to iterate through all the records to identify the ones that meet the salary criteria.\n\n3. Duplicate Records: If the datatable contains duplicate records with the same primeKey (indicating the same person), care must be taken not to count the same individual more than once.\n\n4. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some records might have missing or incomplete salary information, which would need to be handled appropriately to avoid inaccuracies in the count.\n\n5. Data Type Issues: Ensuring that the salary data is treated as numeric values rather than strings is crucial for performing greater-than comparisons.\n\n6. Performance Optimization: For large datasets, finding an efficient way to filter and count the records could be a challenge, possibly necessitating optimization techniques or the use of database queries if available.\n\n7. Complex Data Structures: If the salary information is embedded within nested structures or requires joining multiple tables/arrays, additional parsing logic may be needed to extract the necessary data.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties can help in preparing to parse the datatable accurately and efficiently to answer the question about how many people work with a salary more than 865521."

Considering only those who are employed, we will count how many individuals have a salary greater than 865521.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n1. Person with primeKey 'a' is unemployed.\n2. Person with primeKey 'b' is unemployed.\n3. Person with primeKey 'c' is retired.\n4. Person with primeKey 'd' is unemployed.\n5. Person with primeKey 'e' is employed with a salary of 179425.\n6. Person with primeKey 'f' is unemployed.\n7. Person with primeKey 'g' is unemployed.\n8. Person with primeKey 'h' is employed with a salary of 816757.\n\nIn this list, the only employed individuals are 'e' and 'h'. However, neither of them has a salary greater than 865521 (179425 and 816757 respectively), so the answer is:\n\n**0 people work with a salary more than 865521.**"
