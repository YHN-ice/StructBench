Data Spread Across Multiple Columns or Tables: If the dataset is large and spread out across multiple columns or tables with gender information distributed or segregated, compiling this information accurately would be a challenge.\n\n6. Data Errors: Typos, incorrect entries, or other data input errors could lead to misidentification of some individuals' genders.\n\n7. Large Datasets: If the dataset is particularly large, it may require efficient processing capabilities to handle the data without performance issues.\n\n8. Case Sensitivity: The data might be case-sensitive, and different cases (e.g., \"female\", \"Female\", \"FEMALE\") might be used inconsistently, requiring case-insensitive parsing.\n\n9.
