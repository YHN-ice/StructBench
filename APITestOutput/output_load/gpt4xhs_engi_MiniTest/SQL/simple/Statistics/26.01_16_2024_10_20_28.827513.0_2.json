Varied Representation of Gender:\n   - The dataset could represent gender in different ways (e.g., 'F', 'Female', 'Woman', etc.).\n   - There might be non-binary or other gender options that need clarification on whether to include them in the count.\n\n3. Duplication of Records:\n   - The same female individual might be represented multiple times in the dataset with different primeKey values due to data entry errors.\n\n4. Case Sensitivity:\n   - The gender data could be case-sensitive ('female' vs. 'Female'), which might require normalization before counting.\n\n5. Complex Data Structures:\n   - The dataset could be in a complex format where gender information is nested or not straightforward to extract.\n\n6. Large Datasets:\n   - If the dataset is particularly large, performance and memory issues might arise when parsing the data.\n\n7.
