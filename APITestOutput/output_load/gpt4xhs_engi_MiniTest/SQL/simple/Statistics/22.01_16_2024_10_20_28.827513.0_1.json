For example, the salary might be in different currencies or formats (such as including commas or not).\n\n2. **Multiple Entries per Person**: If the same person (identified by a primeKey) has multiple entries with different salary information, it may require logic to determine which salary to consider or how to handle multiple entries.\n\n3. **Missing or Corrupt Data**: Some rows of data might be missing salary information or contain corrupt data that cannot be interpreted as a salary.\n\n4. **Large Dataset Handling**: If the dataset is very large, it may pose challenges in terms of memory management and processing speed.\n\n5. **Data Type Parsing**: Ensuring that salary values are properly converted from strings (if they are stored as such) to numeric values for comparison.\n\n6. **Accuracy of the Salary Data**: The data might contain inaccuracies or outdated salary information, which would affect the count of people earning more than the specified amount.\n\n7. **Dataset Variability**: The dataset might contain additional information or be structured in a way that requires more complex queries or algorithms to extract the necessary salary information.\n\n8. **Efficient Searching and Counting**: Implementing an efficient algorithm to count the number of people with salaries above the threshold without having to individually compare every single salary value.\n\n9. **Handling of Non-standard Salaries**: If any salaries are reported in a non-annual format (e.g., hourly, weekly, monthly), there would need to be conversions to ensure consistent comparison.\n\n10. **Error Handling**: Ensuring that any errors encountered during parsing do not cause the process to fail silently, leading to inaccurate results.\n\nBefore proceeding, it would be helpful to understand the structure of the datatable and any specific instructions on how to interpret and handle the data within it."
