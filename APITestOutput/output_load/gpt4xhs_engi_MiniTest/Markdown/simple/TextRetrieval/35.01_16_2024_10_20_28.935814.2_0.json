The most common way is to use double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. We need to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold text can be nested inside other elements like lists, blockquotes, or even inside italic text. We should be able to extract the bold text regardless of its nesting.\n\n3. **Escape Characters:** Users can escape the bold syntax characters using a backslash `\\` to display them as literal asterisks or underscores rather than formatting text as bold. We need to distinguish between escaped characters and actual formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Syntax:** Sometimes the Markdown syntax might not be properly closed, e.g., `**bold text`. We have to decide whether to consider such cases as bold or ignore them.\n\n5. **Line Breaks within Bold Text:** There might be line breaks within bold text which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Other Markdown Elements:** Bold text might be surrounded or include other Markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, inline code using backticks `` `code` ``, or images `![alt](url)`. We will need to make sure these don't interfere with detecting bold text.\n\n7. **Ambiguous Cases:** There could be cases where the asterisks or underscores are part of regular text and not meant for bold formatting.\n\nTo handle these challenges, we'll have to carefully craft a regular expression or use a Markdown parsing library that can properly identify and isolate bold text in the Markdown file."
