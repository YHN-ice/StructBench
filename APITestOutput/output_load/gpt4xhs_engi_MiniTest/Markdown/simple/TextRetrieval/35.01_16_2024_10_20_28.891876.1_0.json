Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract all bold texts from a Markdown file:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Syntaxes:** Markdown allows for different ways to denote bold text, such as using double asterisks `**bold text**` or using double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser must handle all such variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links `[**bold link text**](url)`, or italics `*italic and **bold** text*`. Extracting the bold text without including surrounding formatting could be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Bold markers might be escaped within the text, such as `\\**not bold\\**`, which would not actually denote bold text. The parser will need to recognize and ignore these cases.\n\n4. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks (delimited by triple backticks ```) or inline code (delimited by single backticks `) should not be treated as formatted text. Bold syntax within these blocks should be ignored.\n\n5. **Incomplete Markers:** There might be cases where the bold markers are not properly closed, such as `**bold text`. Depending on the parser's strictness, these might be considered formatting errors and not treated as bold text.\n\n6. **Multiple Lines:** Bold text might span across multiple lines, which can complicate the extraction process, especially if line breaks are important to preserve.\n\n7. **Overlapping Formats:** There may be overlapping formatting, such as bold within italic or vice versa. The parser needs to correctly identify and extract only the bold portions.\n\nAddressing these issues will usually require a combination of string processing techniques, regular expressions, and perhaps a more complete markdown parsing library or algorithm to accurately identify and extract the bold text while respecting the context and markdown syntax rules."
