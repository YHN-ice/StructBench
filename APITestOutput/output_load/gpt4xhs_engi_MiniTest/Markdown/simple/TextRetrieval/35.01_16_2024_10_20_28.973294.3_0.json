The parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements like [links](http://example.com) or `inline code`. This could complicate the extraction as we need to decide whether to include or exclude these elements from the raw bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash which means they should not be considered as Markdown syntax (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`).\n\n4. **Overlapping formatting**: There might be overlapping formatting, such as italic and bold (e.g., `***bold and italic***`). The parser needs to correctly distinguish and extract the bold text.\n\n5. **Incorrect or non-standard formatting**: Users might make mistakes or use non-standard Markdown formatting which doesn't actually render as bold in most parsers (e.g., `** not bold because of leading whitespace **`).\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code**: Bold syntax within code blocks (both fenced and indented) and inline code should not be considered as bold text since it is part of a code snippet where Markdown syntax doesn't apply.\n\n7. **Line breaks**: Markdown parsers might handle line breaks within bold syntax differently. Some parsers allow line breaks while others may not recognize the syntax as bold if it's split over multiple lines.\n\n8. **Partial matches**: Text that starts with an asterisk or underscore but doesn't end with a matching pair should not be considered as bold (e.g., `**partial`).\n\nEach of these points introduces complexity to the task of extracting bold texts accurately from a Markdown file. The parser must be robust enough to handle these cases to avoid incorrect or incomplete extraction."
