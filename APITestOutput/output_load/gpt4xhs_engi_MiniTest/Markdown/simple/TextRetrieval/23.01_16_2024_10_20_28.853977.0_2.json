Recognizing and extracting just the file names might require additional parsing logic.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows images to be included using reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the tag but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes images are embedded using raw HTML tags within the Markdown file, such as `<img src=\"image.png\" />`. It's necessary to identify these as well.\n\n5. **Link Confusion**: Distinguishing between image links and regular hyperlinks might be challenging if not paying close attention to the syntax.\n\n6. **Text in Square Brackets**: The text inside the square brackets is meant to be alternative text for the image, but it can sometimes include characters or patterns that may confuse a simple parser.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: It's possible for image syntax to include escaped characters that would need to be handled correctly.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images could be nested inside other markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might affect how they are parsed.\n\n9. **File Extensions**: Not all image links may end with a typical image extension (.jpg, .png, etc.), especially if they are referencing a script or service that generates an image.\n\n10. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line separated by other text or markdown elements.\n\nTo handle these potential issues, a robust parsing strategy must account for various markdown syntaxes, identify the proper context of image links, and extract only the necessary file name information. Now, if you provide the input Markdown file, I can proceed to extract the included image file names."
