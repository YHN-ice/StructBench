For instance, the typical format `![Alt text](URL)` could have variations and additional optional attributes like title `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might embed images using HTML tags like `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"Alt text\">`. This requires the parser to interpret HTML in addition to Markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style links and images, where the URL of the image is not inline but referenced at another place in the document, like `![Alt text][id]` with `[id]: URL \"Title\"` elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Image syntax may include escaped characters that the parser must correctly interpret, such as a parenthesis within an image title or URL.\n\n5. **Non-Image URLs**: Not all URLs in a Markdown file will necessarily be for image files. The parser must discern between image links and other types of links to avoid false positives.\n\n6. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be either relative to the document or absolute URLs. The parser should correctly identify and potentially resolve these paths.\n\n7. **Nested Links or Markup**: Sometimes, images can be nested inside links or other markup elements, adding complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n8. **Comments or Indented Code Blocks**: URLs in comments or within indented code blocks should not be considered as image files, so the parser has to ignore these.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties can help in designing an approach that handles various edge cases and accurately extracts only the intended image file names from the Markdown content."
