We need to correctly identify this pattern to extract the image URLs or file names.\n\n2. **Variations in Image Syntax**: There might be variations in how images are included, such as:\n   - Inline image links vs. reference-style image links.\n   - Images with titles or tooltips (e.g., `![alt text](image_url \"title\")`).\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute URLs**: Images in Markdown can be linked with absolute URLs (e.g., `http://example.com/image.jpg`) or relative paths (e.g., `images/image.jpg`). We should distinguish between URLs and file paths to only extract file names when asked.\n\n4. **Alt Text Confusion**: The alt text for an image could potentially resemble a file name, and we must ensure not to confuse alt text with the actual image file name.\n\n5. **Non-image Links**: We need to discern between image links and other types of Markdown links to avoid extracting non-image files.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: There might be escape characters that we need to handle correctly, especially if they are part of the image file name.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. **File Name Formats**: Image file names could have various formats and extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`). We need to make sure we capture the full file name including its extension.\n\n9. **Other Embedded Media**: There may be other types of embedded media (like videos or audio files) that are not relevant for the question and should be ignored.\n\n10. **Errors in Markdown**: The presence of syntax errors in the Markdown file might lead to incorrect extraction if not properly handled.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles will help us create a more robust approach to extracting image file names from the input Markdown file.
