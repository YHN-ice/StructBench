Each method has a different syntax, so the parser must be able to handle all of them.\n\n2. **Irregular Formatting**: Users might not follow strict Markdown guidelines, leading to irregularities in formatting that can confuse a parser not designed to handle such cases.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: The presence of escape characters like backslashes before image syntax might lead to false positives or negatives.\n\n4. **Link Confusion**: Distinguishing between image files and regular hyperlinks can be challenging, as the syntax is similar and only differentiated by an exclamation mark (!) in the case of images.\n\n5. **Nested Content**: Images could be nested within other elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, making it slightly more complex to parse.\n\n6. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked with relative paths or absolute URLs. The parser must identify both while only extracting the file names or URLs.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Not all image links may have standard image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png). Some may use URLs that redirect to an image or end with query parameters.\n\n8. **Markdown Flavors**: Different platforms use different Markdown flavors, which might have subtle differences in how they handle images.\n\n9. **False Matches**: There might be text within the Markdown that looks similar to image syntax but isn't meant to be an image link.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust Markdown file parser should employ a flexible and comprehensive regex or parsing strategy that can handle the various ways images can be embedded, account for irregular formatting, and distinguish between different types of links and paths."
