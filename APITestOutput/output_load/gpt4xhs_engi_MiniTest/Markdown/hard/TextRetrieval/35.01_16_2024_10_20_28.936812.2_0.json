The parser should only extract the text that is bold, not the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are used to denote formatting, like asterisks (*), might be escaped to display literally rather than as formatting. The parser must differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting**: Bold syntax that is not closed properly (e.g., `**text`) should not be considered as bold text.\n\n5. **False positives**: Asterisks or underscores might be used in contexts that are not meant for text formatting, such as in code blocks or for bullet points in lists. The parser should ignore these cases.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, so the parser should be able to handle multiline formatting correctly.\n\nOnce I see the input, I can accurately extract the bold texts while taking these potential difficulties into account."
