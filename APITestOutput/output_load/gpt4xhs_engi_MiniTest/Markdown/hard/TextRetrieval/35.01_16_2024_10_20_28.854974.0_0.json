In Markdown, bold text is typically indicated by double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` before and after the text. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise while extracting bold text:\n\n1. Inconsistent use of markers: Some Markdown users might use double asterisks in one place and double underscores in another to denote bold text. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text might also include other formatting like italics, code, or strikethrough. The parser needs to handle nested formatting without getting confused by the additional markers.\n\n3. Escaped characters: Users might escape the bold markers with a backslash to display the asterisks or underscores literally instead of applying bold formatting. The parser must distinguish between escaped and non-escaped markers.\n\n4. Incorrect formatting: Sometimes users make mistakes in their Markdown, such as mismatched or unbalanced markers (e.g., **bold*). Depending on the requirements, the parser may need to either correct these mistakes or ignore them.\n\n5. Inline code blocks and fenced code blocks: Text within code blocks shouldn't be parsed for formatting, so the parser must avoid extracting bold text from these regions.\n\n6. Multiline and single-line: Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines or be contained within a single line. The parser must be able to handle both cases.\n\nThese obstacles require the parser to have a good understanding of Markdown syntax and potentially involve regular expressions or a parsing algorithm to accurately extract bold text while ignoring false positives."
