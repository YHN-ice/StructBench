The parser must recognize both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting nested inside it, like italics or code. For example, **bold _and_ italic** or **bold `code`**. It's important to extract only the bold part and handle nested formatting correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes the Markdown might contain escaped characters that look like formatting, e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`. The parser should distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting markers**: In some cases, there might be unmatched or incomplete bold markers, like **bold text. The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases – whether to ignore them or try to extract the text as bold.\n\n5. **Links and images**: Bold syntax can include links `**[link text](URL)**` or images `**![alt text](image URL)**`. The parser must handle these elements correctly.\n\n6. **Inline code blocks**: If a bold marker is included in an inline code block, it should not be treated as bold text, for example, `Here is some code **not bold**`.\n\n7. **Multiline bold text**: Markdown may have bold text that spans multiple lines. The parser should concatenate such lines correctly.\n\n8. **Mixed content**: Bold markers can have mixed content like lists, blockquotes, etc., inside them.\n\nGiven these potential complexities, a robust Markdown parsing approach is needed to accurately extract all bold texts. Once we receive the input file, we'll need to account for these scenarios to provide a correct answer."
