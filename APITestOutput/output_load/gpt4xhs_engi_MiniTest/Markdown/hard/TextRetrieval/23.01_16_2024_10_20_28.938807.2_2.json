This can make it more complex to extract image file names directly.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image sources can be either relative paths or absolute URLs. We need to identify both while ensuring we correctly extract the file name from URLs.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: Some image URLs might be URL-encoded, especially if they contain spaces or special characters, which might require decoding to get the correct file name.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown supports inline HTML, so some images might be included using raw HTML `<img>` tags.\n\n6. **Non-Image Files**: The document might contain links to non-image files, which should not be confused with image files.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be multiple images included on a single line, and the parser should handle this by extracting each image file name separately.\n\n8. **Erroneous Formatting**: Sometimes, the Markdown formatting might be incorrect or inconsistent (e.g., missing closing brackets or parentheses), which can lead to difficulties in correctly parsing the image file names.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the parser must have robust logic to handle various cases and edge cases to ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
