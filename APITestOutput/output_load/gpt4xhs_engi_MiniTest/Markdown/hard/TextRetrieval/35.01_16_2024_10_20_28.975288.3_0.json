Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italics, strikethroughs, links, or inline code blocks. We need to ensure that bold extraction is accurate even within these contexts.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are used literally in a text and are escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold**`). We would need to avoid mistakenly interpreting these as bold formatting.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Syntax**: Users might have used an inconsistent syntax, such as mixing asterisks and underscores or not correctly pairing the opening and closing markers.\n\n4. **Code Blocks**: Text within fenced code blocks (`` ``` ``) or indented code blocks should not be interpreted as formatted text. We must make sure to ignore these sections when extracting bold text.\n\n5. **Links and Images**: The syntax for links (`[text](URL)`) and images (`![alt text](URL)`) might contain asterisks or underscores. We need to differentiate between these and actual bold formatting.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: In Markdown, line breaks can influence the formatting. A newline character can break the bold formatting sequence, so we must account for how line breaks interact with bold syntax.\n\n7. **Overlapping Formats**: There could be overlapping formatting markers where the end of one bold section coincides with the beginning of another.\n\nIdentifying and addressing these challenges would be essential for accurately extracting bold text from a Markdown file. Please provide the input file or the Markdown content so that I can proceed with extracting the bold texts."
