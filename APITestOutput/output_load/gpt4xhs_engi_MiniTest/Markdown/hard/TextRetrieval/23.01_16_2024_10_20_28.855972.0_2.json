We need to distinguish between the two.\n\n5. **Escaped Image Syntax**: Parts of the image syntax could be escaped to prevent them from being recognized as images, such as `\\![Alt text](URL)`.\n\n6. **Nested Content**: Images could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might make extraction more complicated.\n\n7. **Markdown Comments**: Image links might be inside Markdown comments, which could lead to false positives if not handled correctly.\n\n8. **Alt Text Variations**: There may be variations in how alt text is written or omitted, which shouldn't affect image extraction but requires awareness during parsing.\n\nTo correctly extract all image file names, the parser will need to handle these potential issues by implementing robust pattern matching and taking into account the various contexts where image links can appear."
