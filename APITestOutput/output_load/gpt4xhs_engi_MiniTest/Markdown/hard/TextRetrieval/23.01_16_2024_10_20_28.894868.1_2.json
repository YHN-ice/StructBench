In Markdown, images are typically included using the following syntax: `![alt text](image_url \"optional title\")`. However, there are several potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. **Non-standard syntax**: If the Markdown file contains images embedded with non-standard or incorrect syntax, it might be challenging to detect and extract those images.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Images might be linked using either relative or absolute paths. Absolute paths might point to external sources, while relative paths refer to the file system structure relative to the Markdown file's location.\n\n3. **Link references**: Markdown allows for images to be included using reference-style links, which separate the URL from the actual place where the image is used in the text. This means the image URL might not be immediately next to its corresponding alt text.\n\n4. **Markdown variants**: There are different flavors of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and they may have slight variations in how images are embedded.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might include HTML tags for more complex formatting, including image embedding. This can complicate parsing as we would need to look for `<img>` tags in addition to standard Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Escaped characters**: The Markdown file might contain escaped characters that could affect parsing, such as `!\\[` or `\\!\\[]`, which would not actually denote an image.\n\n7. **Text in image syntax**: Sometimes, what appears to be image syntax might actually be text meant to illustrate how to write Markdown, rather than an actual image link.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll look for lines matching the standard and potential non-standard Markdown syntax for images and extract the filenames accordingly, taking into account these potential difficulties."
