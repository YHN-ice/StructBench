If the hierarchy is complex, it might be challenging to locate the correct \"subs\" list and hence the first object.\n\n3. **Correct Key Identification**: It's important to ensure that the key used to access the \"subs\" list is correct. If there are multiple lists or nested objects, it could be confusing to identify which one is being referenced.\n\n4. **Object Structure**: Objects within the \"subs\" list might have different structures. Being able to correctly identify and access the \"id\" of the first object requires understanding its structure.\n\n5. **File Parsing Errors**: Any malformations or syntax errors in the YAML file could prevent it from being parsed correctly, thereby making it difficult to extract any information.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Terms**: The term \"first object\" needs to be clearly defined. Depending on the context, \"first\" could refer to the object with the lowest id value, or simply the one that appears first in the list.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML file or its content, I'll be able to parse through it and answer your question regarding the first object's id in \"subs\"."
