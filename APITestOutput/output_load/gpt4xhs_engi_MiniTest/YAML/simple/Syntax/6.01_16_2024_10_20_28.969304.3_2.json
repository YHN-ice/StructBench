Failure to do so might cause an error.\n\n5. **Duplicate Keys**: Having two identical keys at the same level of a map is not allowed and would be considered an error.\n\n6. **Complex Structures**: Nested structures can become complex, making it difficult to track the alignment and indentation levels properly.\n\n7. **Anchors and Aliases**: YAML allows for the creation of anchors and the use of aliases, which can create confusion if not used correctly.\n\n8. **Version Compatibility**: YAML has different versions (e.g., 1.1, 1.2), and some features may not be compatible across versions.\n\nIf there's a structural error in the provided YAML content, it will likely be related to one or more of these points.
