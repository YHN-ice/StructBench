If not handled correctly, these could complicate the lookup process.\n3. **Multiple Documents:** A single YAML file can contain multiple documents, separated by `---`. Ensuring that the search covers all documents is essential.\n4. **Formatting Issues:** If the YAML file isn't formatted correctly or contains syntax errors, it might be difficult to parse it correctly.\n5. **Large Files:** If the YAML file is very large, it could lead to performance issues or make it harder to locate the object quickly.\n6. **Duplicated Keys:** YAML technically doesn't allow for duplicated keys in a map, but if a file mistakenly has them, it may cause confusion in determining which key-value pair is correct.\n7. **Inconsistent Identifiers:** If identifiers are not used consistently or there are multiple objects with the same id, it could be challenging to determine which object is being referred to.\n\nI am now ready to receive the YAML content and parse it accordingly.
