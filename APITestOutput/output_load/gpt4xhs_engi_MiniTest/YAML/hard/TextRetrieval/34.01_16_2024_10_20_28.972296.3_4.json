This could complicate parsing as it's necessary to properly resolve these references.\n\n5. **Block Scalars**: Multiline strings can be written in different ways (block scalars), such as literal or folded style. This means that string values may need special handling to ensure they are correctly captured as a single value.\n\n6. **Tags and Directives**: YAML allows for custom data type definitions using tags, and directives can alter interpretation rules. These elements might not be relevant for identifying nested objects but they could affect parsing.\n\n7. **Comments**: YAML supports comments, which should be ignored when parsing the content.
