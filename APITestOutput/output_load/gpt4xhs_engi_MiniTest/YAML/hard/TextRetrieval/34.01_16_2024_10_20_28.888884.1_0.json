Inconsistencies or errors in indentation could lead to misinterpretation of the structure or content of the file.\n\n5. **Ambiguity in Identifiers**: If there are multiple objects with the same identifier or if an identifier is mentioned in a context that doesn't clearly refer to a specific object, it could be challenging to determine which object is being referred to.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it could be difficult to manually search through it to find the relevant object.\n\nTo answer questions about an object with a specific ID, I would need to parse through the file, respect the indentation to understand the hierarchy, and identify the object based on the criteria provided (in this case, an object with the ID `s`).
