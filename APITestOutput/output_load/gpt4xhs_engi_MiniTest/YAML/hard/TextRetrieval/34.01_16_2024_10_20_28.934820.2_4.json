Differentiating between these types and filtering out the non-list/dict values at the deepest level adds complexity to the parsing process.\n\n3. **Aliases and anchors**: YAML allows the use of aliases and anchors to reference other parts of the file. Handling these references correctly to determine the actual structure might be tricky.\n\n4. **Blocks and inline notation**: YAML has different ways to represent structures, such as block style and flow (inline) style. A parser must handle both notations and still correctly identify the nesting levels.\n\n5. **Consistent indentation**: YAML relies on indentation to denote structure. Inconsistent indentation could lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n6. **Multiline strings**: Values in YAML can be multiline strings, which may need special handling to ensure they are not mistakenly taken as nested objects.\n\n7. **Comments**: YAML supports comments, which should not be considered part of the actual data structure but might appear interspersed with valid configuration data.\n\n8. **Empty values**: Some entries might not have a value or contain nulls, which need to be handled appropriately.\n\n9. **Merging keys**: The '<<' merge key is used to indicate that all the keys of one or more specified maps should be inserted into the current map. A parser must handle this feature to accurately determine the structure.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a parser must be robust enough to handle all these cases and still identify the deepest non-list/dict values within a YAML file's structure."
