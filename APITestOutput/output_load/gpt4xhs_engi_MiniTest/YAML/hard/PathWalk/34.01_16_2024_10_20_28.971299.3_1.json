A common mistake is incorrect indentation which can lead to misinterpretation of the hierarchy within the file.\n5. **Aliases and Anchors:** YAML supports the use of anchors and aliases to reference other parts of the document, which can complicate the parsing if aliases are used in place of direct values.\n6. **Syntactical Errors:** If the YAML file contains syntactical errors or is not formatted correctly, it may be difficult to parse it accurately.\n7. **Type Casting:** YAML implicitly types some data, which could lead to confusion if expecting a string but receiving an integer or boolean due to YAML's interpretation of the value.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, I would need to view the content of the YAML file and carefully navigate its structure to locate the first object's `id` within the `subs` section.
