Lists vs. Dictionaries: Differentiating between list indices and dictionary keys is important because they are accessed differently (by index for lists and by key for dictionaries).\n\n4. Ambiguity of Short Forms: YAML supports shorthand forms like simple key-value pairs and complex ones with nested structures, which could lead to ambiguity if not properly interpreted.\n\n5.
