The parser should distinguish between actual bold formatting and other reasons for bold appearance.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There might be asterisks used in the document for other reasons (like list items or footnotes), and they should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will allow us to more effectively parse the ORG file for bold text once we see the input."
