The parser needs to correctly identify this syntax.\n\n2. **Handling nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like links or italicized text. The parser should extract only the bold text without including surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Multiline bold text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must handle line breaks correctly and not mistakenly interpret them as the end of the bold text.\n\n4. **Different versions of ORG mode**: If there are different versions of ORG mode, there might be variations in how bold text is formatted. The parser needs to accommodate for these variations.\n\n5. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are part of the org-mode formatting syntax could be escaped within the text. The parser needs to interpret these correctly and not confuse them with formatting commands.\n\n6. **Inconsistent formatting**: Users might make mistakes in their formatting, like missing an asterisk at the end of a bold section. The parser should be robust enough to handle these inconsistencies, if possible.\n\nOnce provided with the input file, these potential issues will guide me in extracting the required information accurately."
