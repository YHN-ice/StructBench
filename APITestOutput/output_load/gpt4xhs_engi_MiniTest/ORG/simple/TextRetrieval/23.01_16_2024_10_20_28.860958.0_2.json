However, based on your request, I can provide you with a generic approach to extracting image file names from a text-based representation of an ORG file.\n\nHere are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Format Variability**: The ORG format is plain text and users can include links or images in various ways. The standard way to include an image would be using the syntax `[[file:image.jpg]]`. However, there may be variations or additional attributes like `[[file:image.jpg][description]]`.\n\n2. **Path Complexity**: Images might be located in different directories or even online. The paths could be absolute or relative which may affect the parsing logic.\n\n3. **Link Confusion**: An ORG file can contain links to various types of files and resources, not just images. The parser must distinguish between these different links and only extract those that are image files.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: There are many image file extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.). The parser must recognize all possible image extensions.\n\n5. **File Naming Conventions**: File names can contain spaces, special characters, or unicode characters, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Sometimes images are embedded directly into files as Base64 encoded strings rather than linked as external files. This would require a different parsing approach.\n\n7. **Markup Variability**: Users might have customized their ORG mode setup so that the markup for images doesn’t follow the standard conventions.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it's important to have a robust parsing approach that can handle variability and exceptions accordingly. Now you can provide the input from which you'd like to extract image file names, and I'll demonstrate how one could parse them from a text representation of an ORG file."
