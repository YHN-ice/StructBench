Extracting the file name would require different parsing strategies for each type.\n\n3. **Embedded vs. external images**: Images could be either linked externally from the web or embedded as file paths. We need to distinguish between these types and extract only those that are file paths.\n\n4. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Image links can be given as relative or absolute paths. Identifying the actual file names would involve processing both types of paths correctly.\n\n5. **Markup confusion**: ORG files can contain a lot of markup for different purposes (like TODO items, timestamps, etc.), and it's possible that some markup could be mistaken for image links if not parsed correctly.\n\n6. **File extensions**: We need to recognize different image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.) and not confuse them with other non-image file extensions.\n\n7. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes file paths might include escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly to extract the actual file name.\n\n8. **Multiline links**: If an image link is broken up over multiple lines, it might be challenging to parse.\n\nNow, I'm ready to see the input ORG file and provide the requested information.
