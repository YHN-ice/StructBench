Typically, this is done using asterisks or equal signs around the text that is meant to be bold. Knowing the exact syntax used is essential.\n\n2. **Handling Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting styles like italic, underlined, or code blocks. Properly parsing these without losing the bold formatting could be challenging.\n\n3. **Partial Bold Text**: Some of the text might be partially bold, with only certain words or phrases within a sentence being bold. We'll need to extract just the bold parts.\n\n4. **Variations in Formatting**: There might be variations in how bold is formatted, such as spaces between the asterisks and the text, or the use of different markers for emphasis.\n\n5. **Metadata or Directives**: ORG files can contain metadata or directives that are not part of the main content. We'll need to distinguish these from the actual content that may contain bold text.\n\n6. **Links and References**: Bold text might contain links or references which have their own syntax that needs to be preserved or processed differently.\n\n7. **Line Continuation**: If a bold section spans multiple lines, we need to ensure we correctly parse the continuation without breaking the text into separate parts.\n\n8. **File Size and Complexity**: A very large file or one with complex nesting and formatting can make parsing more resource-intensive and error-prone.\n\nOnce we have the actual input, these challenges can be addressed by writing or using an appropriate parsing algorithm that considers the syntax and formatting rules of ORG files."
