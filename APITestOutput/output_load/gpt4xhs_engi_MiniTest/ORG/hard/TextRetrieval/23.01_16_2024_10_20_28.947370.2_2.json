Handling all these variations requires understanding all possible inclusion methods.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be referenced using absolute paths or relative paths. A relative path would require additional information about the base directory to resolve the full path.\n\n3. **Non-Standard Syntax**: Users may use non-standard or custom syntax to include images, which may not be easily parseable without custom rules or additional context.\n\n4. **Inline Images vs. Attachments**: ORG files may have images displayed inline or attached as separate files. Attachments may require parsing metadata to locate them.\n\n5. **Commented or Disabled Links**: There might be commented out links or links that are disabled in some way which should not be counted as active image links.\n\n6. **Link Text vs. Link Target**: Some links might have a descriptive text different from the actual link target, requiring careful parsing to extract the correct image file path.\n\n7. **Encoding and Escaping**: File names in links might include URL encodings or escape characters that need to be decoded or interpreted correctly.\n\n8. **File Extensions**: We need to recognize which file extensions correspond to image files, as not all file links may lead to images.\n\nGiven these potential issues, accurate extraction may require a robust parsing strategy that accounts for the diverse ways images can be included and referenced in an ORG file.
