The parser must be able to handle such nested formatting without losing the bold information.\n\n3. **Partial Line Bold:** Some bold text might not span an entire line or paragraph, so the parser should be able to extract bold text that is part of a larger line of text.\n\n4. **Consistent Formatting:** There might be inconsistencies in formatting across the document. For example, if a user mistakenly uses an uneven number of asterisks, it could complicate the detection of bold text.\n\n5. **Special Characters:** Special characters or escape sequences within the bold text might affect how the parser interprets the text.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Sections:** A line may contain multiple sections of bold text. The parser needs to identify and extract all these instances.\n\n7. **Export Settings:** If the ORG file has export settings that modify how text is interpreted (e.g., altering the syntax for bold text), the parser needs to be aware of these to correctly identify bold text.\n\n8. **Version Differences:** Different versions of ORG mode may have different syntax rules for bold text, which could affect parsing.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust parsing algorithm must be in place that can accurately identify and extract bold text while handling all potential complications mentioned above."
