Bold text is typically enclosed within asterisks (e.g., `*bold*` or `**bold**`). However, variations in how users apply this syntax could lead to inconsistencies.\n\n2. **Embedded formatting**: Bold text may be embedded within other formatting elements, such as links, code blocks, or lists. This could complicate the parsing process.\n\n3. **Special characters**: The use of special characters within bold text might interfere with the pattern matching if not accounted for correctly.\n\n4. **Escaped asterisks**: Users might escape asterisks in their text (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which means these instances should not be interpreted as bold.\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines. A simple line-by-line parser might not correctly capture such instances.\n\n6. **Partial bolding within a line**: There could be lines where only part of the text is bold, making it ambiguous whether to extract the entire line or just the bold part.\n\n7. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other bold texts or have other formatting nested within it, complicating the extraction.\n\nIdentifying and addressing these issues would be essential to ensure accurate extraction of bold text from an ORG file."
