Parsing nested formats without losing the bold formatting can be tricky.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users might escape formatting characters to use them as literals. Distinguishing between actual formatting and escaped characters is essential to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle line breaks properly without missing any part of the bold text.\n\n5. **Incomplete formatting**: If the ORG file has incomplete formatting markers (e.g., missing an asterisk at the end), it might not be clear whether the text is meant to be bold or not.\n\n6. **Embedded code or special blocks**: The parser must differentiate between bold text within the main content and any bold text that might appear within code blocks, tables, or other special blocks where formatting might not apply in the same way.\n\n7. **File integrity and encoding**: Issues with file integrity, such as corruption or unusual encoding, could impede the parsing process.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in creating a robust parser that can accurately extract bold texts from an ORG file.
