ORG files, used primarily with the Emacs editor, are plain text files with a specific outline-formatting structure. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise in the process:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Structure**: ORG files are hierarchical, meaning they contain headings and subheadings that can have multiple levels. Distinguishing between these levels accurately is crucial to identifying the correct subsection.\n\n2. **Section Numbering**: Sections in ORG files are typically not numbered by default. The \"1th subsection under 2th section\" implies a numbering system that might not be explicitly stated in the file, requiring interpretation of the structure.\n\n3. **Content Variability**: The content under a given section could include plain text, code blocks, lists, links, or other elements. Parsing these accurately while maintaining the formatting can be challenging.\n\n4. **Link Resolution**: If the content refers to external sources or other parts of the document via links, resolving and including these correctly might be problematic.\n\n5. **Metadata**: ORG files can include metadata (such as TODO status, tags, properties), which may or may not be considered part of the content.\n\n6. **Markup**: ORG files support text markup for bold, italic, underlined text, etc. Preserving this markup in the output may be necessary.\n\n7. **File Size and Complexity**: If the ORG file is large or has a complex structure with many nested sections, it could make parsing more difficult.\n\n8. **Version Differences**: If there have been changes in the way ORG files are structured between different versions of Emacs or Org-mode, that could affect how the file needs to be parsed.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser must be equipped with a robust understanding of ORG file syntax and semantics. Now, please provide the ORG file content so that I can proceed with answering your question."
