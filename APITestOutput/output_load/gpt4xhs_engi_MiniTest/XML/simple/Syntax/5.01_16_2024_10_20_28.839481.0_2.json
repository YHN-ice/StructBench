There are several instances where the opening tag does not match with the closing tag, for example:\n   - `<E>` has no closing tag.\n   - `<F>` is not closed before `<G>` starts.\n   - `<G>` is closed with `</C>` instead of `</G>`.\n   - `<I>` is not closed before `<J>` starts.\n   - `<M>` has no closing tag.\n   - `<R>` has no closing tag.\n   - `<S>` is not closed before `<T>` starts.\n   - `<T>` is not closed before `<U>` starts.\n   - `<U>` is not closed before `<V>` starts.\n   - `<V>` has no closing tag.\n   - `<W>` has no closing tag.\n   - `<X>` has no closing tag.\n   - `<Y>` is not closed before `<Z>` starts.\n   - `<EB>` has no closing tag.\n   - `<IB>` is not closed before `<JB>` starts.\n   - `<JB>` is not closed before `<KB>` starts.\n   - `<LB>` has no closing tag.\n   - `<NB>` is not closed before `<OB>` starts.\n   - `<OB>` is not closed before `<PB>` starts.\n   - `<PB>` is not closed before `<QB>` starts.\n   - `<QB>` has no closing tag.\n   - `<TB>` is not closed before `<UB>` starts.\n   - `<UB>` is not closed before `<VB>` starts.\n   - `<VB>` is not closed before `<WB>` starts.\n   - And many more similar errors...\n\n2.

Improperly nested tags: Tags that should be nested within each other are sometimes found at the same level, indicating incorrect hierarchy.\n\nTo correct these errors, each opening tag should have a corresponding closing tag, and the tags must be properly nested within each other.
