The parser must correctly handle the case sensitivity of the attribute value.\n\n4. **Inherited Attributes**: In some XML schemas, attributes can be inherited from parent elements. The attribute of interest might not be directly on the element but could be inherited.\n\n5. **Entity References and Character Encoding**: XML may contain entity references or use different character encodings that could affect how attribute values are parsed and matched.\n\n6. **Large Files and Performance**: If the XML file is extremely large, performance considerations may come into play when searching for elements with specific attributes.\n\n7. **Valid XML Format**: The parser requires that the input XML is well-formed and valid.
