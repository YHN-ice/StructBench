This could require parsing the file in chunks or using a streaming JSON parser.\n\n2. **Nested Structure**: JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays, which means that the object with the specified id might be deeply nested inside the structure, requiring recursive search or complex querying.\n\n3. **Multiple Objects with Same ID**: If the JSON file does not enforce unique ids, there might be multiple objects with the same id, which could lead to ambiguity in identifying the correct object.\n\n4. **Non-standard ID Field**: The id field might not be named \"id\" or could be in a different format (such as UUIDs, integers, or composite keys), which would require knowing the schema or structure of the JSON beforehand.\n\n5. **Data Types and Formats**: The value of the id field might have different data types (string, number) or formats that might need to be normalized or validated before comparison.\n\n6. **Missing or Incorrect IDs**: There could be instances where the object with the specified id does not exist or there's an error in the id value, which could lead to an unsuccessful search.\n\n7. **Performance Issues**: Searching for an object by id could be time-consuming if the JSON file is not indexed, and performance could become an issue depending on the size of the file and the efficiency of the search algorithm.\n\n8. **File Corruption or Syntax Errors**: If the JSON file has syntax errors or is corrupted, it may not be possible to parse it correctly, thus making it impossible to find any object by id.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles can help in preparing strategies to effectively parse the JSON file and retrieve the required information."
