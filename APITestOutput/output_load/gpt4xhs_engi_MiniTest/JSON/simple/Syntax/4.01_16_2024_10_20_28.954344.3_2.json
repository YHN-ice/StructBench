Missing or extra commas: A common error is the omission of a comma between elements in an array or between members in an object, or the addition of an extra comma where it's not needed.\n\n2. Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and strings: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Missing quotes or the use of single quotes can lead to errors.\n\n3. Incorrect data types: JSON supports specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). Mismatching data types (e.g., using a string to represent a boolean) can be an issue.\n\n4. Brace and bracket matching: Curly braces `{}` and square brackets `[]` must be correctly paired and nested to define objects and arrays.\n\n5. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages like JavaScript which may allow trailing commas in arrays and objects, JSON does not permit this and it will lead to an error.\n\n6. Syntax errors: Any deviation from the JSON format rules (e.g., using JavaScript comments, missing colons between keys and values) will result in a syntax error.\n\n7. Encoding issues: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8, and any deviation from this could cause problems, especially with special or non-ASCII characters.\n\nWhen you provide the JSON input file, I will check for these issues to determine if there are any structural errors.
