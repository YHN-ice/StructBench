An error could be a mismatch of data types, such as placing a number where a string is expected without quotes.\n\n3. **Quotes:** In JSON, all strings should be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid and will result in an error.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas:** While some modern programming languages and data formats allow trailing commas in lists and objects, JSON does not. A trailing comma after the last element in an array or object is an error.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues:** JSON text must be properly encoded. It uses UTF-8 by default. Improperly encoded files could cause parsing errors.\n\n6. **Depth and Complexity:** Very deeply nested or complex JSON structures might make it difficult to visually inspect for errors.\n\n7. **Comments:** JSON does not support comments.
