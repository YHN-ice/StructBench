Mistakenly using an unsupported data type or formatting a value incorrectly (e.g., including a date without converting it to a string) can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Nested Structures**: JSON can contain nested arrays and objects. If the nesting is complex, it can be easy to lose track of the structure and make mistakes like mismatched opening and closing brackets or braces.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text must be encoded in Unicode. Encoding issues can cause problems when parsing the file, especially if special characters are not handled correctly.\n\n5. **Large Files**: Very large JSON files can be difficult to parse because of the memory and performance overhead. This might not directly cause structural errors, but it can make identifying and correcting them more challenging.\n\n6. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments. Including them can cause parsing to fail, even though some parsers may support comments as an extension of the standard.\n\n7. **Compatibility with JSON Parsers**: Different JSON parsers may have different tolerances for minor deviations from the standard.
