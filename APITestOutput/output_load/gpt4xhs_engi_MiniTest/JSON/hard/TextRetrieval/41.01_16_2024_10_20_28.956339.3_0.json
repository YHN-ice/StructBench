For instance, if ids are stored as integers in some places and strings in others, this could complicate the lookup.\n\n3. **Case Sensitivity:** JSON keys are case-sensitive. If we look for 'kb' but the actual key is 'KB' or 'Kb', it might not be found unless we account for different cases.\n\n4. **Multiple Occurrences:** There might be multiple objects with the same id. We need to determine if we should return the first occurrence or handle multiple entries in some way.\n\n5. **Large Files:** If the JSON file is very large, it could potentially cause memory issues when trying to parse it all at once. It might be necessary to stream the file and parse it incrementally.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues:** If the file is not using a standard encoding like UTF-8, there might be issues in reading and interpreting the data correctly.\n\n7. **Error Handling:** The JSON file may have errors or might not be properly formatted, which will cause parsing to fail unless error handling is in place.\n\n8. **Access Permissions:** There might be restrictions on reading the file if it is located on a secure server or requires authentication.\n\n9. **Data Integrity:** The data in the file might be outdated or incorrect, leading us to provide incorrect information based on the contents of the file.\n\nOnce we have access to the JSON file, we'll need to parse it while taking into account these potential difficulties, and then locate and return the object with the id of 'kb'."
