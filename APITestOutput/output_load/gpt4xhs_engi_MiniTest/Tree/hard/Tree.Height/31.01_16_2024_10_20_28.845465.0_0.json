        "To determine the height of the root node from the given tree structure, you do not need to parse a file format but rather work with the provided edge list that defines the tree. Given that each line represents an edge u->v from parent u to child v, we can construct a tree data structure and then calculate its height.\n\nTo tackle this problem, you can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the tree from the root node and find the maximum depth. Since leaves have a height of 0, as you traverse the tree, you count the number of edges to find the height of the root node. Here's a high-level outline of how you could implement this:\n\n1. Parse the input to build a tree data structure (e.g., using adjacency lists to represent the tree).\n2. Implement a recursive DFS function that traverses the tree and calculates the depth of each node.\n3. Call the DFS function on the root node and keep track of the maximum depth encountered.\n4. Return the maximum depth as the height of the root node.\n\nSince this is a conceptual explanation, I'll now translate it into a concrete example using pseudo-code:\n\n```python\n# Create a dictionary to hold the adjacency list\ntree = defaultdict(list)\n\n# Given input edges as strings \"u->v\", populate adjacency list\nfor edge in input_edges:\n    u, v = edge.split(\"->\")\n    tree[u].append(v)\n\n# Recursive DFS function to calculate depth\ndef calculate_depth(node, depth):\n    # if the node is a leaf, return its depth\n    if not tree[node]:\n        return depth\n    # otherwise, return the maximum depth of its children\n    return max(calculate_depth(child, depth + 1) for child in tree[node])\n\n# Assuming 'u' is the root, call DFS to find the height of the root\nheight = calculate_depth('u', 0)\n\n# Print or return the calculated height\nprint(height)\n```\n\nTo address your specific input, we'll need to construct the actual adjacency list first and then run a similar DFS function to calculate the height. Since this is not executable code and I don't have an actual programming environment here, please use this strategy as a guide to implement the solution in your own programming environment.\n\nGiven your specific input, which represents a very large tree, it's clear that the height is substantial because there are many chained edges (e.g., u->v->w->"
