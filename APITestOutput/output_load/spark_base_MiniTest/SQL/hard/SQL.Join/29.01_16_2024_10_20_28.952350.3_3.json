        "This problem seems to be asking for a SQL query that selects the count of people in Illinois who are taller than 161cm. To answer this, we need to join the two tables on the 'primeKey' field (which appears in both tables), filter by height, and then count the number of records.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) \nFROM Table1 \nINNER JOIN Table2 ON Table1.primeKey = Table2.primeKey \nWHERE Table1.height > 161;\n```\n\nThis query will return the count of people in Illinois who are taller than 161cm according to the data provided. Please replace \"Table1\" and \"Table2\" with your actual table names if they are different.To solve this problem, we can use Python and the pandas library to filter the data based on the height condition.
