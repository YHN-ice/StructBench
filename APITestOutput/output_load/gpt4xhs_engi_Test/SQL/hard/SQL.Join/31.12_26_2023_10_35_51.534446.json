Handling missing data will be crucial to ensure accurate results.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Units**: Heights might be recorded in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches). We must ensure that all heights are compared using the same unit of measurement.\n\n4. **Data Formatting**: Data might be inconsistently formatted. For example, heights could be stored as strings with text (like \"170cm\") instead of numeric values, which would require preprocessing to extract the numeric part for comparison.\n\n5. **Duplicates**: There might be duplicate entries for the same person (same `primeKey`), which need to be identified and handled appropriately to avoid double-counting.\n\n6. **Location Data Variability**: The location field might have variability in how WA is recorded (e.g., \"WA\", \"Washington\", \"W.A.\", etc.), so it will be necessary to standardize the location data before filtering.\n\n7. **Data Type Issues**: Numeric fields such as height might be stored as text, requiring conversion to a numeric type for comparison.\n\n8. **Case Sensitivity**: Text fields like location might be case-sensitive, requiring normalization (e.g., converting all text to uppercase or lowercase) before comparison.\n\nBy anticipating these potential issues, we can prepare to handle them during the data parsing process to ensure an accurate count of people working in WA who are taller than 170."
