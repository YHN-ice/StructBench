Here are a few potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to answer the question based on a datatable:\n\n1. **Data Quality and Consistency**: If the data is not consistently formatted, or if there are errors in the data (such as typos or incorrect measurements), it could be challenging to determine the accuracy of the height values and the work locations.\n\n2. **Missing Data**: If some rows are missing the information on either height or work location, it may be difficult to include those individuals in the count.\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries**: If the datatable contains duplicate rows for the same individual (with the same primeKey), care must be taken not to double-count these individuals.\n\n4. **Variations in Measurement Units**: If heights are recorded in different units (such as feet/inches and centimeters), we will need to standardize the measurements to compare them accurately.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Location Data**: The term \"TX\" may refer to Texas, but if the datatable includes other location-related information that's not standardized (like city names or abbreviations), it may require interpretation to confirm that \"TX\" indeed refers to Texas.\n\n6. **Composite Data Fields**: Sometimes, data tables might have composite fields (e.g., a 'Location' field containing both city and state information). Parsing these correctly to isolate the state information would be necessary.\n\n7. **Data Volume**: If the datatable is very large, it might present a challenge in terms of computation time and efficiency.\n\n8. **Data Privacy**: Depending upon the source of the data, there may be privacy considerations which restrict how the data can be used or reported.\n\n9. **Data Encoding/Format Issues**: When working with data files, sometimes encoding or format issues (like CSV vs. Excel formats, character encoding mismatches) might pose challenges in parsing and interpreting the data correctly.\n\n10. **Complex Data Relationships**: There might be complex relationships between different pieces of data (for instance, multiple rows that need to be linked by a 'primeKey') that require careful handling to ensure accurate counting.\n\nOnce you provide the datatable, I'll be able to take these concerns into account while parsing the data to answer your question."

        "Based on the provided input data, to determine the number of people who work in Texas (TX) and are taller than 158 centimeters, we need to look at two columns: 'height' and 'location'.
