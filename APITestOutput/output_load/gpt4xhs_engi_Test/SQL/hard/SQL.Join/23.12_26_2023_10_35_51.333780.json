        "To answer the question about how many people who work in NY are taller than 153, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Join the two tables on the `primeKey` to associate the individual's work location with their height.\n2. Filter the joined data for individuals who work in NY (`location` = NY).\n3. Count the number of individuals who are taller than 153 from the filtered data.\n\nThe dataset provided is small and simple enough to analyze without sophisticated data parsing tools or programming languages. I will manually join the tables based on the `primeKey` and apply the filters as described above:\n\nFirst, we join the tables:\n\n| primeKey | height | company | location |\n|----------|--------|---------|----------|\n| g        | 213    | NVIDIA  | NY       |\n| i        | 177    | Meta    | NY       |\n| l        | 158    | Google  | NY       |\n\nNext, we filter for individuals who work in NY and are taller than 153:\n\n- Individual g: Height = 213, Location = NY (Meets both criteria)\n- Individual i: Height = 177, Location = NY (Meets both criteria)\n- Individual l: Height = 158, Location = NY (Meets both criteria)\n\nAll three individuals listed above work in NY and are taller than 153.
