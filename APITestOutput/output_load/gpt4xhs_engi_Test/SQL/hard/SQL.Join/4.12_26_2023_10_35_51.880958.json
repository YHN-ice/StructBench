        "Given the input data, our goal is to count the number of people who work in Washington (WA) and are taller than 179 cm. To accomplish this, we will review the data in both sections of the tables provided: the first section with personal data (including height) and the second section with employment data (including location). We must match individuals based on their primeKey and filter according to the specified criteria.\n\nTo solve the problem, we will go through the following steps:\n\n1. Identify individuals who work in WA by looking at the \"location\" column in the employment section of the data.\n2. Of these individuals, find those who are taller than 179 cm by reviewing the \"height\" column in the personal data section.\n3. Count the number of individuals who meet both criteria.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the data:\n\n- **a**: Works in WA, but height is 138, so does not meet the height criterion.\n- **b**: Does not work in WA.\n- **c**: Does not work in WA.\n- **d**: Does not work in WA.\n- **e**: Does not work in WA.\n- **f**: Does not work in WA.\n- **g**: Works in CA, so does not meet the location criterion.\n- **h**: Does not work in WA.\n- **i**: Does not work in WA.\n- **j**: Does not work in WA.\n- **k**: Does not work in WA.\n- **l**: Does not work in WA.\n- **m**: Works in NY, so does not meet the location criterion.\n\nAccording to this analysis, there are no people who both work in WA and are taller than 179 cm within the provided dataset.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 0 people."
