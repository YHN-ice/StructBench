        "Based on the given datatable and the question, we want to find out how many people who work in CA (California) are taller than 180 centimeters.

Identify all rows where the `location` is CA and the associated primeKey.\n2. Of those identified rows, count how many have a `height` greater than 180.\n\nLet's apply this to the data provided:\n\n- For `primeKey` \"b\", height = 161 cm, location = CA (does not meet height requirement)\n- For `primeKey` \"d\", height = 188 cm, location = CA (meets height requirement)\n- For `primeKey` \"e\", height = 185 cm, but the location is WA (not in CA)\n- The rest of the rows do not have a CA location.\n\nFrom the data provided and our requirements:\n\n**1 person** who works in CA is taller than 180 centimeters, which corresponds to the entry with `primeKey` \"d\"."
