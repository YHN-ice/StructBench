Duplicate Entries: If the same person (identified by a primeKey) has multiple entries, care must be taken to ensure they are only counted once.\n\n4. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, information regarding a person's work location and height may be on separate rows, requiring a join or merge operation on the primeKey to get a complete picture before filtering.\n\n5. Non-Numeric Height Values: If heights are recorded with units or non-numeric characters, they will need to be cleaned to extract numeric values for comparison.\n\n6. Inconsistencies in State Representation: The state could be represented by full names, abbreviations, or codes, and there may be inconsistencies or typos that need to be reconciled.\n\n7.
