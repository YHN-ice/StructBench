Inconsistent Data Entry: \n   - There might be different formats or entries for the state of Illinois (e.g., IL, Illinois, Ill.), which would require normalization to ensure all relevant data is captured.\n   - Heights might be recorded in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, feet, inches), necessitating a unit conversion to ensure accurate comparison.\n\n2. Duplicate or Incomplete Records:\n   - There may be duplicate records for the same person (same primeKey) with conflicting or complementary information that needs to be merged or reconciled.\n   - Some records might be missing necessary information, such as height or work location.\n\n3. Inaccurate or Outdated Information:\n   - The dataset could contain outdated information where individuals' work locations or heights have changed.\n\n4. Data Volume and Performance:\n   - The size of the dataset could be large, meaning that the process of filtering and comparing records may need to be optimized for performance.\n\n5. Ambiguities in Data Representation:\n   - The term \"taller than 174\" needs clarification—does it mean strictly greater than 174 cm, or does it include 174 cm?\n\n6. Data Access and Permissions:\n   - Depending on the storage and format of the datatable, there may be issues with accessing the necessary data due to permissions or data protection regulations.\n\n7. Complex Data Structures:\n   - The datatable might have complex relationships or a structure that requires more advanced parsing techniques to extract the relevant information.\n\nBefore proceeding with the parsing task, it's important to understand the structure of the datatable and have a clear plan for addressing these potential challenges."
