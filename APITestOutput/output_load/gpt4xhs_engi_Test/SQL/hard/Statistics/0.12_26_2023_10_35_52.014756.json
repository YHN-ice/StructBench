Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the parsing process:\n\n1. **Data Format Consistency:** The datatable must have a consistent format for representing salary figures. If salaries are represented in different formats or currencies, additional processing may be required to standardize the values.\n\n2. **Missing or Incomplete Data:** Some rows may have incomplete data, particularly in the salary column. We will need to ensure that we handle such cases appropriately, either by skipping those entries or using a default assumption if justified.\n\n3. **Data Accuracy:** The provided salary data should be accurate. Any inaccuracies in the input file could lead to incorrect counts.\n\n4. **Large Dataset Handling:** If the datatable is very large, it might be challenging to process it efficiently. We need to ensure that our parser can handle large volumes of data without running out of memory or taking an excessive amount of time.\n\n5. **Duplicate Entries:** Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we must be careful not to count the same person multiple times if their information is split across multiple rows.\n\n6. **Data Sorting and Filtering:** The dataset may not be sorted by salary, so we will need to filter out the relevant entries with salaries greater than 864689.\n\n7. **Data Type Conversion:** Salary data may need to be converted from string to numeric types for comparison operations.\n\n8. **Special Cases:** There might be special cases where the salary figure includes non-numeric characters (like symbols or letters) indicating things like estimated salary, range, etc., requiring custom parsing rules.\n\nOnce we begin parsing the datatable, we'll need to address these potential issues to ensure an accurate count of people with salaries exceeding the specified amount."
