It may include currency symbols, commas, decimal points, or be stored as text. This requires proper parsing and conversion to numerical values.\n\n2. **Multiple Entries per Person**: If the datatable uses a primeKey to denote individual people, there may be multiple rows for a single person if they have different attributes (like addresses or phone numbers) listed. We must ensure each person is only counted once.\n\n3. **Incomplete or Inconsistent Data**: Some rows may have missing or incorrectly entered salary data. We'll need to handle these cases without skewing the results.\n\n4. **Filtering Complexity**: The datatable might contain a large amount of data, which could make filtering for a specific salary range computationally intensive.\n\n5. **Data Access and Query Efficiency**: Depending on the format and size of the datatable, accessing the relevant data and performing the query efficiently could be challenging.\n\n6. **Data Types and Comparison Accuracy**: The data type used to store the salary might affect comparison accuracy. For instance, if salaries are stored as floating-point numbers, comparing them might require special consideration due to potential precision issues.\n\n7. **Data Privacy and Security Considerations**: Salary information is sensitive. Depending on the context in which this question is posed, there may need to be considerations for data privacy and confidentiality when accessing and processing this information.\n\nOnce you present the datatable, I'll be able to provide a more accurate assessment of the potential issues that might arise and proceed with answering the question accordingly."
