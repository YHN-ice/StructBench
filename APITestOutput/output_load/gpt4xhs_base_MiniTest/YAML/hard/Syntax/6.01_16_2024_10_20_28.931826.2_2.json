All the trailing commas after the scalar values (e.g., `o,`, `n,`, etc.) should be removed.\n2. YAML uses indentation to represent hierarchy, but there are some lines with incorrect indentation, creating ambiguity in the structure. For example, the lines with `:q`, `:r`, `:s`, etc., are incorrectly indented.\n3. The colon (:) is used to separate keys from values in YAML.
