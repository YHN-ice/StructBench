Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the root node 'm' to find the maximum depth.\n\nLet's consider each node and its immediate depth from the given input:\n```\nm (root, depth 0)\n|- n (depth 1)\n|  |- o (depth 2)\n|  |  |- p (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- q (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- r (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- s (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |\n|  |- t (depth 2)\n|  |  |- u (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- v (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- w (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- x (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |\n|  |- y (depth 2)\n|  |  |- z (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- ab (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- bb (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- cb (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |\n|  |- db (depth 2)\n|     |- eb (depth 3, leaf)\n|     |- fb (depth 3, leaf)\n|     |- gb (depth 3, leaf)\n|     |- hb (depth 3, leaf)\n|\n|- ib (depth 1)\n|  |- jb (depth 2)\n|  |  |- kb (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- lb (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- mb (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |  |- nb (depth 3, leaf)\n|  |\n| ...\n```\nThe pattern seems consistent; every child node after 'm' is three levels deep with leaves at depth level three.
