        "To determine the height of the root node, which in this case is node 's', we need to find the longest path that leads from 's' down to any of its leaf nodes.\n\nFrom the input provided, we can see that the node 's' has multiple children nodes, and each of those nodes further branches out. We need to find the branch with the most number of edges. \n\nThe edges represent direct connections between parent and child nodes. To find the height, we count the number of edges along the longest path.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- 's' has many child nodes ('t', 'ob', 'jc', 'ed'), and each of these nodes further branches out.\n- We need to follow down each branch from 's' to see which has the most edges until we reach a leaf (a node without children).\n\nBy visually inspecting the input or systematically going through each branch, we can determine that all branches directly below 's' have similar structures — they all have two levels of depth.
