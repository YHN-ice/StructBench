        "To determine how many people who work in Illinois (IL) are taller than 173, we need to find out which individuals are employed and located in IL and then count those whose height exceeds 173.\n\nHowever, from the provided input, we see that the location column includes GA (Georgia), TX (Texas), HI (Hawaii), WA (Washington), CA (California), and NY (New York). There is no mention of IL (Illinois) in the location column. Therefore, based on the available data, there are no people listed as working in Illinois.\n\nMoreover, even if we were to consider all locations and not just Illinois, we do not see any height data that specifically lists the height as \"173.\" Therefore, we cannot answer the question regarding the number of people taller than 173 because of the lack of relevant location data and height being specified as exactly \"173.\" The closest we can get with the given data set is to count the number of people taller than 168, as that is the highest height given that is below 173.\n\nFrom the input provided, only two individuals have heights listed above 168:\n\n- Individual b: Male, height 211\n- Individual e: Male, height 217\n\nBoth individuals are not employed (one is retired and the other is unemployed), so they would not count toward the number of employed persons in Illinois who are taller than 173.\n\nIf the location and specific height data were provided, we would filter for 'employed' status, 'IL' location, and 'height > 173' to get the correct count."
