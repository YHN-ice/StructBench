Many of the elements are not properly closed, for instance:\n    - The `<J>` element is opened but not closed.\n    - The `<N>` element is opened but not closed.\n    - The `<M>` element is opened but not closed.\n    - The `<G>` element is not closed.\n    - The `<F>` element is not closed.\n    - Similar issues with elements like `<LB>`, `<FB>`, `<KB>`, `<ZB>`, `<CC>`, `<JC>`, and others.\n\n2. Nesting of tags is incorrect, with some elements starting within another element's scope but closing outside of it (which is not allowed in XML). For example, `<H>` starts inside `<D>`, but closes after `<J>` which is a sibling of `<H>`, not a parent or the same element.\n\n3. Some tags are missing entirely, such as the closing `</A>` for the root element `<A>`.\n\nXML requires that all elements must have a matching start and end tag (except for self-closing tags), and proper nesting must be observed where an element must be closed before its parent element is closed."
