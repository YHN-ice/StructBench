For example, if some rows are missing salary information, it could lead to an underestimation of the number of people earning above the specified threshold.\n\n4. **Duplicate Records**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there might be duplicate salary entries for some individuals. It's important to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n5. **Data Type Issues**: Salary data may not be properly formatted as numeric values, which could cause problems in comparison operations if they are treated as strings or mixed types.\n\n6. **Large Dataset Handling**: If the dataset is very large, it might cause performance issues and require efficient processing methods.\n\n7. **Correct Comparison**: The comparison operation must correctly identify salaries greater than 145751, taking into account any potential leading or trailing spaces, currency symbols, or other non-numeric characters that might be present with the numbers.\n\n8. **Filtering and Aggregation**: After identifying the correct rows, it will be necessary to count them accurately, avoiding any double counting or omission.\n\nOnce these potential difficulties are considered, the actual parsing and counting can proceed more smoothly."
