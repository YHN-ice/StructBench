If the salary data is not uniformly formatted or contains non-numeric characters, it could pose a challenge in determining which values are actually above 636628.\n\n2. **Large Dataset**: If the datatable is very large, efficiency becomes an issue.

If they are read as strings or another non-numeric data type, incorrect comparisons could lead to inaccurate counts.\n\n5. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: If some rows are missing the salary information or if the data is incomplete, it may be difficult to determine whether those individuals should be included in the count.\n\n6. **PrimeKey Recognition**: It will be necessary to correctly identify and use the primeKey to ensure that we are counting unique individuals rather than just unique entries.\n\n7. **Data Accuracy**: Assuming that the data provided is accurate and up-to-date is crucial because outdated or incorrect salary figures would lead to an inaccurate count.\n\nOnce we have the datatable available, we will need to address these potential issues to accurately determine how many people have salaries greater than 636628."
