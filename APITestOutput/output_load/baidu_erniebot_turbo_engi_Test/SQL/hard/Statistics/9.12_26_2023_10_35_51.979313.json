If stored as strings or other types, they would need to be converted to a numeric type for comparison.\n\n6. **Mixed PrimeKey Representation**: The primeKey that identifies individuals could be represented inconsistarily (e.g., varying cases of letters, leading zeros), making it difficult to accurately match rows pertaining to the same individual.\n\n7. **Sorting and Filtering Efficiency**: Efficiently sorting or filtering the data to identify the rows of interest based on the salary threshold could be challenging depending on the tools and methods used for parsing.\n\nAddressing these potential challenges requires careful data validation, normalization, and parsing strategies to ensure accurate results."
