        "根据您提供的信息，对于问题“What is the company of record with primeKey b”，需要先确定您想要了解的是哪个primeKey对应的公司。因为您提供了两份表格，每份表格中都有primeKey、gender、age、name、height、weight、color和status等字段，所以需要先明确是哪个表格中primeKey为b的记录对应的公司。\n\n如果您想要了解的是表格1中primeKey为b的记录对应的公司，那么根据表格1中的数据，primeKey为b的记录有两条数据，一条显示这个人现在没有工作，另一条显示这个人现在正在微软公司工作。所以这个问题的答案可能是“Microsoft”。\n\n如果您想要了解的是表格2中primeKey为b的记录对应的公司，那么根据表格2中的数据，可以得出这个人现在正在Google公司工作。所以这个问题的答案可能是“Google”。\n\n综上所述，由于您没有明确指出想要了解的是哪个primeKey对应的公司，所以无法给出一个准确的答案。如果您能提供更多信息，我将尽力帮助您解答这个问题。"
