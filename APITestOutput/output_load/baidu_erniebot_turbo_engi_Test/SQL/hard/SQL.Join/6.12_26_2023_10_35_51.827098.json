Data Formatting: The data might not be uniformly formatted, which could make parsing more challenging. Inconsistencies in units (e.g., height listed in both centimeters and inches) or variations in the way locations are recorded (e.g., \"IL,\" \"Illinois,\" or misspellings) can cause issues.\n\n2. Missing Data: There may be missing values in critical fields, such as the 'height' or 'state' columns, which would make it difficult to determine if a person fits the criteria.\n\n3. Ambiguous Identifiers: If the primeKey is not unique or if there's any ambiguity in identifying individuals, it could lead to inaccurate counts.\n\n4. Data Volume: If the dataset is very large, it might be computationally demanding to process all the information quickly.\n\n5. Multiple Entries for Individuals: If individuals are listed multiple times with different attributes (e.g., multiple rows for the same person but with different heights), this can complicate the process of determining their actual height.\n\n6. Data Types and Conversion: The height data might need to be converted into a uniform measurement system (e.g., converting all heights to centimeters) before making comparisons.\n\n7. Complex Query: The condition of working in \"IL\" and being \"taller than 169\" is a two-part query that requires checking multiple columns for each individual, which can increase the complexity of parsing.\n\n8. Data Errors: Typos or data entry errors could misrepresent an individual's actual height or work location.\n\n9. Encoding Issues: If the data table is not encoded in a standard format (e.g., UTF-8), there might be issues with special characters or non-English text.\n\n10. Performance Optimization: Ensuring that the parsing algorithm is efficient and can return results in a timely manner, especially with large datasets.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to address these challenges appropriately to ensure an accurate count of people who work in IL and are taller than 169."
