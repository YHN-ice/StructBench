Data Inconsistency: If the data entries are not consistent (e.g., different units of measurement for height, variations in state abbreviations), it could be challenging to compare and filter the data accurately.\n\n2. Missing Data: If there are missing entries for either the height or the working location of individuals, it might be impossible to determine whether they meet the criteria.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: If the dataset contains duplicate rows for individuals (the same primeKey), it is important to identify and count each person only once.\n\n4. Data Format: The format in which the data is presented could present challenges. For example, if the height is stored in a non-numeric format or mixed with text, additional parsing would be required.\n\n5. Ambiguous Data: If there are ambiguities in the data, such as individuals working in multiple locations including WA, there may need to be additional rules or information to categorize them correctly.\n\n6. Large Dataset: If the datatable is very large, performance could be an issue, requiring efficient parsing and querying techniques.\n\n7. Incorrect Data: Errors in the data could lead to incorrect counts, so some form of data validation or cleaning might be necessary.\n\n8. Complex Data Structure: If the datatable has a complex structure or multiple related tables, it might require advanced querying or joining techniques to get the necessary information.\n\nWithout knowing the structure and quality of the datatable, these are some general challenges that could arise.
