Here are a few obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. Data Format: If the salary data is not consistently formatted (e.g., different currencies, use of commas or periods for thousands or decimal separator), parsing the data could be challenging.\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some records might have missing or incomplete salary information, making it difficult to determine those individuals' actual salaries.\n\n3. Multiple Records per Person: If the datatable contains multiple records for the same person (noted by the same `primeKey`), care must be taken to only count that person once, regardless of how many times their salary is listed.\n\n4. Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, performance might be an issue, and efficient algorithms or data structures may be needed to process the records in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n5. Correct Interpretation of Salary Information: Salaries might be presented in different time frames (e.g., annual, monthly, hourly). Ensuring that all salary data is normalized to the same time frame before comparison is important for accuracy.\n\n6. Textual Representations of Numbers: Salaries may be written out in text form or as a mix of text and numbers (e.g., \"one hundred ninety-three thousand two hundred twenty-two\"). This would require additional parsing to convert to a numeric form for comparison.\n\n7. Data Types: Ensuring that the salary data is parsed as numeric values for comparison rather than as strings or other data types is crucial for accurate comparisons.\n\nOnce these potential difficulties are taken into account, a systematic approach can be developed to ensure that the question is answered accurately."
