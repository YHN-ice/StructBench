Inconsistent Data Entries: The gender information might be entered inconsistently (e.g., \"Female,\" \"F,\" \"Woman,\" etc.), so the parser will need to recognize all possible variations representing females.\n\n3. Multiple Rows per Person: As the same primeKey indicates the same person, there may be multiple rows for each individual. Care must be taken to count each person only once, regardless of how many rows they have in the datatable.\n\n4. Data Errors: Typos or incorrect entries in the gender column could result in inaccurate counts if not properly identified and handled.\n\n5. Formatting Issues: Inconsistent data formatting, such as different casing (e.g., \"female\" vs. \"Female\"), leading/trailing spaces, or special characters, could affect the accuracy of the parser's ability to correctly identify female entries.\n\n6. Large Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, performance considerations might need to be taken into account to efficiently process the data without running into memory or time constraints.\n\n7. Ambiguous Entries: There might be ambiguous entries where the gender is not clearly defined or is marked with non-standard indicators.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can identify specific issues and address them accordingly to accurately determine the number of females in the datatable."
