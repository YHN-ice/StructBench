If there are inconsistencies such as a mix of currency formats, commas, periods, or other characters within the salary fields, these will need to be standardized.\n\n3. **Missing or Incomplete Data:** If any records are missing salary information or have incomplete data, it will be difficult to determine whether those individuals should be counted.\n\n4. **Duplicate Records:** With duplicate rows (same primeKey), we need to ensure that each individual is only counted once. We need to identify unique individuals and not count them multiple times if their data appears more than once.\n\n5. **Data Type Issues:** Salary data should ideally be in a numerical format for comparison purposes. If the salary is stored as a string or with text annotations (e.g., \"K\" for thousands), this needs to be converted into a numerical value for accurate comparisons.\n\n6. **Performance Issues:** If the parsing logic is not optimized, it might lead to performance issues when handling large datasets.\n\nOnce we begin parsing the data, we may encounter additional unforeseen challenges that will need to be addressed in order to accurately answer how many people are working with a salary greater than 685086."
