Based on your question, you want to know how many people are female.\n\nTo answer this question, you can simply count the number of female records in the dataset. To do this, you can use a programming language like Python or SQL to loop through the table and count the number of female records.\n\nFor your specific case, here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n\n```python\n# import pandas library for data processing\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# read the dataset into a dataframe\ndf = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')\n\n# loop through the dataframe and count the number of female records\nfemale_count = df[df['gender'] == 'female'].count()\n\nprint(f'The number of female people is: {female_count}')\n```\nIn this code, `pd.read_csv()` is used to read the CSV file into a pandas dataframe. Then, we use a loop to iterate through the dataframe and count the number of female records using `df[df['gender'] == 'female'].count()` method. Finally, we print the number of female people.\n\nRemember to replace `'your_dataset.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset file. If your dataset is in a different format or location, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."
