Here are a few potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise when attempting to answer the question about the number of people who work in IL and are taller than 168:\n\n1. **Data Format Consistency**: If the data tables are not consistently formatted, it may be difficult to parse the information correctly. Inconsistent data entries for height, state, or other relevant fields could lead to inaccuracies.\n\n2. **Missing Data**: If some rows are missing data for the state (IL) or for height, it might be unclear whether to include or exclude these entries from the count.\n\n3. **Data Spread Across Multiple Tables**: If the information is spread across multiple tables with a key to join them, there may be challenges in correctly joining the tables on the appropriate key.\n\n4. **Non-Standard Units**: If height is not recorded in a standard unit (for example, if it's a mix of centimeters and inches), converting them to a uniform measurement could be tricky.\n\n5. **Errors in Data**: Typos or incorrect data entries could lead to misclassification of individuals who should otherwise meet the criteria.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Location Representation**: The abbreviation \"IL\" must be clearly defined as Illinois; however, if there's ambiguity in location representation (e.g., city names used instead of state abbreviations), it could complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. **Complex Filtering Conditions**: The need to filter on multiple conditions (works in IL and taller than 168) adds complexity to parsing and increases the potential for logical errors.\n\n8. **Duplicate Data**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there's a possibility of counting duplicates if not handled properly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful data validation, standardized preprocessing, and accurate filtering based on the defined conditions will be necessary."
