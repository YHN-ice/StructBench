Inconsistent units of measurement: Heights could be recorded in different units (centimeters, meters, inches, etc.), necessitating unit conversions to maintain consistency.\n\n3. Missing or incomplete data: Some records may have missing height or location information, which would complicate the process of filtering the relevant individuals.\n\n4. Data spread across multiple tables: If the information on work location and height is spread across different tables using a primary key, we'll need to join these tables accurately before we can filter the data.\n\n5. Data errors or outliers: There may be errors in the data, such as implausible heights or incorrect location codes, which could lead to inaccurate results.\n\n6.
