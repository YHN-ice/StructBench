This requires parsing the height and location columns accurately.\n\n5. **Conversion of Units**: If heights are not in a uniform unit (e.g., some are in feet while others are in centimeters), converting all heights to the same unit will be necessary to make accurate comparisons.\n\n6. **Performance**: If the datatable is large, performance might be an issue. Efficient filtering and parsing will be necessary to ensure the operation completes in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n7. **Ambiguities**: The question assumes 'taller than 166' refers to a height in centimeters. If the '166' is in another unit or lacks context within the data, this could lead to incorrect results.\n\nOnce we have the datatable and understand its structure, we can address these potential issues accordingly."
