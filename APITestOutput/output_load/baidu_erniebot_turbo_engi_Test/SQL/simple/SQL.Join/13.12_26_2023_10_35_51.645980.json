If the data is inconsistently formatted or contains errors, extracting accurate information will be challenging.\n\n2. **Multiple Tables**: If the data about where people work and their height is split across multiple tables, we will need to join these tables using a common key (primeKey).\n\n3. **Column Names**: The exact column names for the state (IL) and height need to be known. If the column names are ambiguous or not standardized, it may lead to confusion.\n\n4. **Height Units**: The height could be recorded in different units (e.g., feet, inches, meters). We must ensure that the heights are all in the same unit and that \"166\" is in the correct units.\n\n5. **Missing Data**: There may be missing data for either the location of work or height. Handling missing values correctly is crucial to avoid inaccuracies.\n\n6. **Duplicate Records**: The same person might be listed more than once, so it’s important to identify unique individuals.\n\n7. **Data Scale and Performance**: If the dataset is very large, the performance of the parsing operation can be an issue and may require optimization.\n\n8. **Filtering Criteria**: Applying both criteria (working in IL and being taller than 166) simultaneously might require conditional filtering, which can be complex depending on the structure of the datatable.\n\nOnce we have the structured input file, we can address these challenges accordingly."
