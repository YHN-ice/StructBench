However, there could be several difficulties and obstacles in parsing and analyzing the datatable:\n\n1. **Data Quality and Consistency**: The data might have inconsistencies such as different units for height (centimeters, meters, feet, inches) that need to be standardized before comparison. There may also be missing or incorrect data entries.\n\n2. **Data Format**: The datatable could be in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.), and understanding the structure of the datatable is crucial for parsing it correctly.\n\n3. **Column Identification**: Identifying the correct columns that contain the information about the state (GA) and height is essential. There could be multiple columns with similar names or irrelevant information that need to be navigated.\n\n4. **Duplicate Records**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there might be duplicate records for individuals. We would need to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n5. **Filtering Criteria**: Properly applying the filtering criteria (working in GA and being taller than 180) simultaneously to ensure accuracy in the count.\n\n6. **Data Parsing and Interpretation**: Efficiently parsing the data could be challenging, depending on the size of the datatable and computational resources available.\n\n7. **Numeric Comparison**: Making sure that the height is compared as a numeric value rather than a string to avoid incorrect comparisons due to lexicographic ordering.\n\n8. **Aggregation**: Once the relevant data is identified and filtered, correctly aggregating the count of people who meet both criteria is necessary.\n\nBy anticipating these potential difficulties, we can approach the datatable parsing task with a more structured plan for extracting the required information accurately. Please provide the datatable so we can proceed with parsing it and answering your question."
