Inconsistent or missing data: If the height or work location (CA) information is incomplete or missing for some individuals, it may not be possible to accurately determine who meets the criteria.\n\n2. Data spread across multiple rows: Since the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we need to ensure that we are accurately consolidating information across rows to get the full details of an individual's height and work location.\n\n3. Data in different units: Height might be recorded in different units (such as centimeters or inches). Consistent units are necessary for comparison.\n\n4. Variations in location representation: The work location \"CA\" needs to be consistently represented. There may be variations such as \"California\" or \"Calif.\" that also need to be considered.\n\n5. Duplicate entries: There could be duplicate rows for the same person, which need to be identified and removed to avoid counting someone twice.\n\n6. Data formatting: The format of the height data could vary (e.g., 175, 175cm, 1.75m) which would require normalization for accurate comparison.\n\n7. Data errors: There could be typographical or data entry errors that misrepresent an individual's true height or work location.\n\nOvercoming these obstacles would involve careful data validation, normalization of units and formats, and thorough checking for consistency across rows for each individual's entries."
