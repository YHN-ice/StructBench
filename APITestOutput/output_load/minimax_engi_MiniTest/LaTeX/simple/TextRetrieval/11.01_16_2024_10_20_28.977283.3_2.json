The parser must handle cases where the extension is not provided and consider common graphic extensions like `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.pdf`, `.eps`, etc.\n\n4. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command and others may have options that change the parsing, like scaling, rotation, etc., which can be enclosed in square brackets before the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX comments, which start with `%`, might contain lines that look like figure inclusion commands but should be ignored.\n\n6. **Environment Wrappers**: Figures are often wrapped in different environments like `figure`, `minipage`, etc. This shouldn't affect the extraction but needs to be considered in parsing.\n\n7. **File Name Spaces**: Sometimes filenames or paths with spaces are included within double braces `{{` and `}}`, or quotes `\" \"`.\n\n8. **Command Variants**: Some documents may define new commands for including graphics, which could be used instead of the standard `\\includegraphics`.\n\nGiven these challenges, please provide the LaTeX input file so I can extract the included figure files for you."
