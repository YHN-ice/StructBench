The parser would need to understand these environments to extract their contents properly.\n\n7. **Incomplete tags**: If the LaTeX file contains syntax errors, such as an unclosed `{` after a `\\textbf`, this could lead to incorrect parsing results. \n\n8. **Math mode**: Bold text inside math mode (e.g., `$\\mathbf{v}$`) might be required to be extracted differently or might be exempt from extraction depending on the instructions.\n\nGiven that these are common obstacles when parsing LaTeX files, the parser would need to be designed with these considerations in mind to accurately extract all bold texts."
