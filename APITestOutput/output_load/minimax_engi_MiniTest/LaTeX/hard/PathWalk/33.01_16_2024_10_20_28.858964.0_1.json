Identifying the right level in the hierarchy could be challenging without proper parsing logic.\n\n2. **Custom Commands**: If the LaTeX document uses custom commands or macros for structuring, it might be difficult to recognize the hierarchy without understanding these customizations.\n\n3. **Comments and Formatting**: Comments in a LaTeX file (lines starting with `%`) might contain text that looks like section headings but should not be treated as such. Additionally, formatting commands can be interspersed with content, which could complicate extraction.\n\n4. **Environment Conflicts**: LaTeX environments (like `figure`, `table`, `enumerate`, etc.) may contain subsection-like formatting within them, potentially confusing a simple search for subsection commands.\n\n5. **Counting Sections**: Identifying the \"1th\" section and subsection requires tracking the occurrences of `\\section` and `\\subsection` commands, respectively. For subsubsections, the same applies to `\\subsubsection` commands.\n\n6. **Label and Reference Commands**: There might be `\\label` commands associated with sections or subsubsections that could be mistaken for content if not handled correctly.\n\n7. **Inclusion of Other Files**: Sometimes LaTeX documents include other files using the `\\input` or `\\include` command. If the second subsubsection is in such a file, it would be necessary to parse that file as well.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one must parse the LaTeX document systematically, respecting its hierarchical structure and taking special care to handle LaTeX-specific commands and formatting appropriately."
