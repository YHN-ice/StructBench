A robust parser should handle both cases, with and without file extensions.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Figures might be included using relative or absolute paths, and the parser should correctly extract the filepath regardless of how it's specified.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures, especially in the case of figures being included in a loop or with conditional statements.\n\n5. **Commented Out Code**: The LaTeX file may contain comments that include the figure inclusion commands. These should not be counted as actual figure inclusions.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that internally use the `\\includegraphics` command. Identifying figure includes within such customizations can be challenging.\n\n7. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments which might include additional brackets before the actual filename. The parser should not confuse these with the filename.\n\n8. **Complex File Paths**: File paths with spaces, special characters, or commands might complicate the parsing process.\n\n9. **Nested Files**: If the LaTeX document inputs or includes other files that in turn include graphics, the parser would need to recursively check these nested files for figure inclusions.\n\n10. **Environment Specific Inclusions**: Graphics might only be included within specific environments, such as within a `figure` environment, and the parser needs to understand this context.\n\nThe parser will need to carefully handle these scenarios to accurately list all included figure files."
