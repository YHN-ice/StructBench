The primary command for including graphics in LaTeX is `\\includegraphics`, typically found within a `figure` environment. However, there might be several challenges and obstacles in accurately extracting the file names:\n\n1. **Variations in Include Commands**: LaTeX allows for optional arguments in the `\\includegraphics` command, which could be placed before the file name. The parser must handle such optional arguments correctly to extract the file name.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: The file path can be given as a relative path from the location of the LaTeX file or as an absolute path in the system. The parser should extract the file name regardless of the path type.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX users might omit file extensions because LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type. The parser must be able to handle situations with and without file extensions.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: There is also the possibility that multiple files are included within a single command, for example using a wildcard character like `*` or in a comma-separated list.\n\n5. **Custom Commands**: Users might define their own commands to include graphics, which could obscure the direct use of `\\includegraphics`.\n\n6. **Comments**: The LaTeX file might contain comments (`%`) that comment out certain lines, including `\\includegraphics` commands. The parser should ignore these commented lines.\n\n7. **File Names with Spaces or Special Characters**: If the file names contain spaces or special characters, they may be enclosed in `{}` or `\"`, and the parser must account for these cases to extract the correct name.\n\n8. **Multiple Files with the Same Name but Different Extensions**: There might be files with the same name but different extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`), and the parser should list each one individually if they are included in the document.\n\nAnticipating these difficulties will help develop a more accurate and robust LaTeX file parser for extracting figure file names."
