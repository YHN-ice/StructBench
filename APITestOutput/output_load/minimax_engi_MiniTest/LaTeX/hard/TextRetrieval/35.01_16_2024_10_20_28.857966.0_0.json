Bold commands within comments should not be considered.\n\n5. **Handling Braces**: Braces `{}` are used for grouping in LaTeX. Text extraction must respect the grouping and not break at every brace occurrence.\n\n6. **Line Breaks and White Spaces**: In LaTeX, line breaks and white spaces may appear within the arguments to formatting commands.
