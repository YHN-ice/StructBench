It's important to extract just the text without including any nested LaTeX commands unless they also indicate bold text.\n\n3. **Brace matching:** Since LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to denote the scope of commands, the parser must correctly match opening and closing braces, especially in the presence of nested environments.\n\n4. **Custom commands:** A LaTeX document may define custom commands that set text to bold. The parser would need to be aware of these custom definitions to recognize bold text defined in this way.\n\n5. **Comments:** The LaTeX file may contain comments (denoted by `%`) that include the word \"bold\" or similar formatting commands, but these should not be considered as bold text since they don't affect the compiled output.\n\n6. **Conditional formatting:** Some bold formatting might be conditional, e.g., inside `\\if` statements, and evaluating whether the text is indeed displayed as bold might require understanding of the logic.\n\n7. **Incomplete or malformed commands:** If the LaTeX file contains errors, such as incomplete or malformed bold commands, it may be challenging to determine what the intent was and whether any text should be extracted as bold.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser must be robust and flexible, taking into account all LaTeX syntax rules and potential variations in how bold text can be represented."
