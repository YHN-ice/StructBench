These differences must be handled appropriately.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Sometimes the LaTeX document includes the file extension (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`), and sometimes it does not. The parser should be able to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: A single `\\includegraphics` command can sometimes include multiple files, especially when using wildcards or multiple files separated by commas.\n\n5. **Commented Out Lines**: Figures that are included in lines that have been commented out should not be considered as they are not part of the final document.\n\n6. **Graphics Inside Environments**: Figures might be included within different environments (e.g., `figure`, `minipage`) which means that the parser needs to consider the LaTeX structure and context.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Macros**: The document might define custom commands or macros that include graphics, which would require the parser to expand these macros to find the included graphics.\n\n8. **Conditional Inclusion**: Figures might be included conditionally (e.g., using `\\if` statements) and understanding these conditions might be necessary to determine whether a figure is indeed included.\n\n9. **Options to Includegraphics**: The `\\includegraphics` command might contain options that alter how the figure is included (e.g., rotation, scale), which are not part of the file name but need to be parsed correctly to extract the file name.\n\n10. **Encoding and Special Characters**: File names might contain special characters or be encoded in a way that requires proper handling (e.g., spaces, underscores, UTF-8 characters).\n\nEach of these points represents a potential complication for accurately extracting figure filenames from a LaTeX document."
