This means the parser needs to be able to recognize both cases.\n\n4. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments for scaling, rotating, or cropping images etc., which could complicate the extraction of the filename.\n\n5. **Comments**: Some figures might be commented out in the LaTeX source file. Depending on the requirements, it may or may not be necessary to filter out those commented lines.\n\n6. **Custom Commands**: There may be custom commands or macros defined in the LaTeX document for including figures, which would not be recognized without parsing and understanding those custom definitions.\n\n7. **Environment Usage**: Figures might be included inside different environments like `figure`, `minipage`, etc. and could be nested within other environments making the parsing more difficult.\n\n8. **File Name with Spaces or Special Characters**: If a file name contains spaces or special characters, it may be enclosed within double braces or quotes, which needs to be considered while parsing.\n\n9. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: In some cases, LaTeX allows including multiple figures within one command (e.g., using subfigures), and each of these will need to be identified separately.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the parser will need to carefully interpret the LaTeX source code, taking into account the syntax and semantics of LaTeX commands pertaining to figure inclusion.
