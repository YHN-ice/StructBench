Data Format: If the salary data is not consistently formatted (e.g., mixed use of commas, periods, or different currencies), it may require additional processing to standardize and compare values.\n\n2. Large Dataset: If the data table is extremely large, it could be computationally intensive to parse through all the records to find the ones that match the salary criterion.\n\n3. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows might have missing or incomplete salary information, which would require a decision on how to handle these cases (e.g., skip, estimate, or use default values).\n\n4. Duplicate Records: Since the same primeKey indicates the same person, we need to ensure that we do not count a person more than once if their salary information appears in multiple rows.\n\n5. Data Integrity: There might be errors or outliers in the salary data that seem implausible (e.g., extremely high or low values) that could affect the count.\n\n6. Data Parsing: The requirement to only count unique individuals means we need to correctly parse the primeKey and salary fields, taking into account any variations or anomalies in how these are recorded.\n\nNow you can provide the input file, and I'll proceed to address these challenges while determining the number of people with a salary greater than $122,853."
