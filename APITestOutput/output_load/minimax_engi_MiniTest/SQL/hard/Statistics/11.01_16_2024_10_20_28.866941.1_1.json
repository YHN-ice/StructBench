Data Format: The salary data must be in a numeric format that is comparable. If the salaries are in different currencies or some are listed as text or with errors, additional steps will be needed to standardize them.\n\n4. Data Consistency: Inconsistencies in the data entries, such as different formats for the primeKey or inconsistent use of identifiers, could make it difficult to identify unique individuals.\n\n5. Missing Data: If there are missing or null values in the salary column, we need to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n6. Data Filtering: We must accurately filter salaries to include only those above 239623, which requires correct parsing and comparison of numerical values.\n\n7.
