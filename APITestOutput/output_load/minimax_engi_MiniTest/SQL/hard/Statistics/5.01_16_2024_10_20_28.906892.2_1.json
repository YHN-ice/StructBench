        "To accurately answer the question about how many people have a salary greater than 454637, we need to consider the potential difficulties and obstacles mentioned earlier. Here's a step-by-step approach to tackle this problem:\n\n1. Load the datatables: First, we need to load both the person and salary datatables into memory.\n\n2. Clean and format the salary data: Ensure that all salary data is consistently formatted (e.g., numeric values without non-numeric characters) and convert any inconsistent formats to a standard format.\n\n3. Merge the person and salary datatables: Combine the two datatables based on the 'primeKey' column, which represents the unique identifier for each person. This will give us a single datatable with both person information and their corresponding salaries.\n\n4. Filter out entries with salaries less than 454637: Using the combined datatable, filter out entries where the salary is less than 454637.\n\n5. Count the remaining entries: Count the number of entries remaining after the filtering process, which represents the number of people with salaries greater than 454637.\n\n6. Address potential obstacles: If any of the potential obstacles mentioned earlier are encountered during the process, address them accordingly to ensure accurate results.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately determine the number of people with salaries greater than 454637."
