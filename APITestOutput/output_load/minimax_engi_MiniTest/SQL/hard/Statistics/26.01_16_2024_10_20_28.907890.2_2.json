Inconsistent Data Formats: If gender data is not consistently formatted (e.g., 'F', 'Female', 'fem', etc.), it may require additional logic to ensure all variations are accounted for.\n\n2. Missing Data: If some rows are missing gender information, it could lead to an undercount of the total number of females unless we have a way to infer or look up missing data.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: If the same individual is listed more than once with the same or different primeKeys, it will be necessary to de-duplicate entries to avoid double-counting.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Representation: In the case where gender is represented by a non-binary system or includes transgender individuals, we'd need clear rules on how to count these entries as female or if they should be included in a separate category.\n\n5. Data Spread Across Multiple Tables: If the dataset is spread across multiple tables, we need to ensure that all tables are parsed and cross-referenced correctly using primeKeys.\n\n6. Incorrect Data Entries: Human error or data entry mistakes could result in incorrect gender being recorded for some individuals.\n\n7. Case Sensitivity: The parser should handle cases where the gender might be listed in different cases (e.g., 'female', 'Female', 'FEMALE').\n\n8. Language Variations: The dataset might contain gender information in different languages, which would need appropriate translation or mapping to ensure accurate counts.\n\n9. Privacy Restrictions: Depending on the source of the data, there might be privacy laws restricting the use of gender information, necessitating anonymization or aggregation before parsing.\n\n10. Data Volume: If the dataset is very large, there could be performance and memory considerations for processing the data efficiently.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust datatables parsing strategy needs to include data validation, cleaning, normalization of gender representations, deduplication methods, and possibly natural language processing techniques for ambiguous or complex cases. Now let's proceed with analyzing the actual data to answer your question."
