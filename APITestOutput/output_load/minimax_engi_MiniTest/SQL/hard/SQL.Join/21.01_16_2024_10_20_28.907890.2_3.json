Multiple Rows per Person: If the datatable includes multiple rows with the same primeKey (indicating the same person), we need to ensure we count each person only once.\n\n3. Data Filtering: We need to filter the dataset to only include individuals working in IL and then further filter to include only those who are taller than 161.\n\n4. Unit Conversion: If height is not provided in the same unit (e.g., centimeters), we may need to convert heights to ensure we are comparing them correctly.\n\n5. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some entries may have missing information (e.g., height or state not listed), which would complicate the process of determining eligibility based on the criteria.\n\n6. Data Parsing: We must be able to parse the datatable accurately to extract the necessary information for each person.\n\n7. Deduplication: We have to deduplicate entries to ensure that if a person has multiple entries, they are only counted once in the final tally.\n\n8. Data Errors: There may be errors or anomalies in the data that need to be identified and handled appropriately to avoid incorrect counts (e.g., typos in state codes or unrealistic height values).\n\nTo proceed with providing an accurate answer, we would need to examine the input file to understand its structure and determine how these potential difficulties can be addressed."
