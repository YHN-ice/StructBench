Missing Data: If any rows are missing height or location information, it will be unclear whether those individuals should be included or excluded from the count.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: There might be duplicate rows for the same person (indicated by the same primeKey). Care must be taken to count each person only once.\n\n4.

        "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Clean and format the data: Ensure that all heights are in the same unit (e.g., centimeters) and that all location data is clear and consistent.\n\n2. Handle missing data: Decide whether to include or exclude individuals with missing height or location information.\n\n3. Remove duplicate entries: Group the data by primeKey to ensure that each person is counted only once.\n\n4. Clarify location descriptor: Confirm that \"NY\" refers to the intended geographic area (e.g., New York City or New York State).\n\n5. Join or aggregate data: Combine information about height and work location based on the primeKey.\n\n6. Check for human error: Review the data for typos or incorrect entries and correct them as needed.\n\n7.
