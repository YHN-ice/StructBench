Care must be taken to count each eligible person only once.\n\n5. **Data Errors**: There may be errors in the data, such as typos or incorrect entries, which could lead to incorrect tallies unless identified and corrected.\n\n6. **Filtering Criteria**: Proper filtering must be applied to ensure that only those who work in GA and are taller than 167 cm are counted. Any errors in filtering could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Location Data**: The abbreviation \"GA\" must be clearly defined as Georgia and not be confused with other potential uses of the same abbreviation.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the data set is very large, there might be performance issues when processing the data, although this is less likely to be a problem for a human-assisted process compared to an automated one.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can proceed with addressing these potential issues to accurately determine the number of people who meet the criteria."
