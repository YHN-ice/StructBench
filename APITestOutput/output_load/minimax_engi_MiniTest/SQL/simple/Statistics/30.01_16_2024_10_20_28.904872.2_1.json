If salaries are listed in different currencies or formats, they will need to be normalized to compare correctly.\n\n3. **Duplicate Records**: There may be duplicate records for individuals (rows with the same primary key) across the tables. It's important to ensure that each individual is only counted once.\n\n4. **Data Accuracy**: The salary data must be accurate and up-to-date. If there are outdated or incorrect salary entries, they could affect the count.\n\n5. **Data Types and Sorting**: Salaries need to be stored as numeric types to be compared against the specified threshold. If they are stored as strings or other non-numeric types, they will need to be converted first.\n\n6. **Threshold Ambiguity**: The threshold provided ($264,362) needs to be understood as an exclusive or inclusive limit. This means we need to clarify whether you are asking for salaries strictly greater than $264,362 or salaries greater than or equal to $264,362.\n\n7. **Large Data Volume**: If the dataset is particularly large, it may require efficient querying or processing techniques to expedite the count.\n\n8. **Missing Data**: If there are missing salary values, we will need a strategy for handling these—whether to exclude them from the count or to impute some value.\n\n9. **Data Privacy**: Salaries are sensitive information. Depending on the source of the data, there might be privacy concerns that restrict access or require special handling.\n\nBefore proceeding, it will be important to clarify any ambiguities and ensure that we have a clear understanding of the data structure and any related constraints. Additionally, having access to the data and its schema will be essential for providing an accurate count."
