Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows might have missing or incomplete salary information, which could lead to inaccurate counts if not handled properly.\n\n3. Data Type Issues: The salary data must be interpreted as numerical values rather than strings to perform comparisons. If the data is not in a numeric format, it may require conversion before analysis.\n\n4.
