If the concept of the primeKey isn't clear, or if there are errors in the primeKey values (such as duplicates), it could lead to mistakes in identifying unique individuals.\n\n4. **Variation in Units:** If heights are recorded in different units (centimeters, meters, inches, feet), there may need to be conversions to ensure accurate comparisons.\n\n5. **Filtering by State and Height:** We need to correctly filter the dataset for people working in IL (Illinois) and then further filter to find those who are taller than 167 cm. If any filtering step is incorrect, it could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n6. **Incomplete Data:** If any relevant data rows are missing or incomplete, this could impact the accuracy of the answer.\n\n7. **Data Volume:** If the dataset is very large, it could present a technical challenge in terms of processing speed and memory usage.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in \"Taller than 167\":** It needs to be clarified whether \"taller than 167\" includes people who are exactly 167 cm tall or only those who exceed that height.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we will be able to determine which of these potential issues actually exist and develop strategies to overcome them."
