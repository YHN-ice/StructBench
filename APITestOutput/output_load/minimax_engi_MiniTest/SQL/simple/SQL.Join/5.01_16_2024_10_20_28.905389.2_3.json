Data spread across multiple rows or tables: If an individual's information is spread across multiple rows (e.g., one row for height and another for location), it will be necessary to correctly join these rows based on a unique identifier.\n\n4. Ambiguities in location data: There might be different ways that \"IL\" is represented in the dataset (e.g., \"Illinois,\" \"IL,\" \"Ill,\" etc.), necessitating a check for all possible variations.\n\n5.
