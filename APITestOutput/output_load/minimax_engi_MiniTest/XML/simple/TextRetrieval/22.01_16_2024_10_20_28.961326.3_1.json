structures, which could make it challenging to find the correct tag among many similar or deeply nested tags.\n\n2. **Namespace Handling**: XML files may use namespaces, which could complicate the parsing process if the parser isn't configured to handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Multiple Attributes**: An element might have multiple attributes, so we need to ensure that we're checking the
