A tag that opens within another tag must close before the outer tag closes.\n\n3. **Missing root element:** An XML document must have a single root element that encapsulates all other elements.\n\n4. **Attribute errors:** Attributes within a tag should be properly formatted with values enclosed in quotes.\n\n5. **Special characters:** Special characters (like `<`, `>`, `&`, `\"` and `'`) should be encoded (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;` and `&apos;`).\n\n6. **Declaration and encoding:** If an XML declaration is used, it must be at the beginning of the document, and the encoding specified must be correct.\n\n7. **Namespace issues:** If namespaces are used, they must be properly declared.\n\nPotential obstacles in identifying these errors could arise from not having access to the file content, not having a clear or well-structured input to analyze, or not knowing the intended schema or DTD against which the XML should be validated.\n\nPlease provide the XML content for analysis, and I will determine if there are any structural errors."
