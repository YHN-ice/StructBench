Relative paths might refer to files within different directories or subdirectories, and these paths could be complex.\n\n3. **Link Confusion**: Markdown links are similar in syntax to image embeds but have no preceding exclamation mark. It might be confusing to differentiate between them if the parser does not correctly account for this.\n\n4. **Title and Alt Text Noise**: The alt text and title of an image can sometimes contain characters or patterns that resemble file names, which could lead to false positives.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax. This could be overlooked if the parser only accounts for Markdown-specific syntax.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Not all image files will have standard extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. There could be less common image file formats to consider as well.\n\n7. **Broken Syntax**: There might be typos or incorrect syntax within the Markdown file that could lead to missing out on some embedded images.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: The file encoding might affect how the content is read and parsed, potentially leading to missed or incorrectly interpreted image links.\n\n9. **Nested Content**: Images could be nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes, which might complicate the parsing logic.\n\n10. **Comments**: Sometimes, images or links might be commented out within the Markdown. Depending on the requirements, one might need to decide whether to include or exclude these.\n\nDevising a robust parsing strategy that accounts for these potential issues is essential for accurately extracting all image file names from a Markdown file."
