The potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the extraction process include:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: There may be variations in the image syntax, such as spaces between the exclamation mark and the square brackets, or missing alt text or optional titles. Being a parser, I must account for these differences.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image URLs might be given as absolute paths (including `http://` or `https://`) or relative paths to the location of the Markdown file. I need to distinguish between web URLs and file paths.\n\n3. **Encoded or Special Characters**: The image filenames might contain URL-encoded characters or special characters that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style image inclusion, where the URL reference is defined elsewhere in the document. I must be able to resolve these references.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Image syntax might be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes, which could complicate extraction.\n\n6. **Non-standard Syntax**: Some Markdown flavors or extensions might use non-standard syntax for embedding images, which a standard Markdown parser wouldn't recognize.\n\n7. **Comments and HTML**: Images embedded using HTML tags within the Markdown file or images that are commented out should not be extracted.\n\nIn order to provide the correct answer, I would need to see the input Markdown file to determine which of these obstacles are present and need to be addressed."
