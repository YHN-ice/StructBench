For example:\n   - Inline image syntax: `![alt text](image-url)`\n   - Reference-style image syntax: `![alt text][reference]` followed somewhere in the document by `[reference]: image-url`\n   This means the parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute URLs**: An image URL might be a relative path or an absolute URL, and the parser needs to differentiate between URLs and local file paths.\n\n3. **Alt Text Confusion**: Since the alt text of an image can contain almost any character, the parser needs to correctly identify the end of the alt text and the beginning of the URL.\n\n4. **Markdown Links vs. Images**: Markdown links have a similar syntax to images. The parser needs to distinguish between links `![alt text](url)` and images `![alt text](image-url)`.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Sometimes markdown elements can be nested, such as an image inside a list item. The parser must correctly process such nested elements without getting confused by the additional markdown characters.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown syntax allows for characters to be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as markdown code. The parser must recognize these and not get confused by escaped characters that resemble markdown image syntax.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Not all image files will have a standard `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif` extension, the parser may also need to recognize other valid image file extensions.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: A line in Markdown may contain multiple images, so the parser will need to extract each one separately.\n\n9. **Invalid Syntax**: The file may contain syntax errors or incomplete image markup, which the parser should ideally handle gracefully, either by ignoring or reporting them.\n\n10. **Performance**: If dealing with a very large Markdown file, performance could become an issue, and the parser would need to be optimized for efficiency.\n\nOnce the input file is presented, I can apply these considerations to accurately extract all included image files' names."
