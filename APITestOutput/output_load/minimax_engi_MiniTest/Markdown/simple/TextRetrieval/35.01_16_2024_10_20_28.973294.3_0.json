A parser needs to account for all possible syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text can be nested inside other formatting elements like italics, blockquotes, lists, etc. The parser needs to be able to handle nested elements correctly and still extract the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users can escape formatting characters using a backslash `\\` to display them as literals rather than formatting, such as `**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to differentiate between actual bold text and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incorrect syntax handling**: The parser may encounter incorrect Markdown syntax, such as mismatched asterisks or underscores. It needs to have a strategy for handling or ignoring these cases.\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text can span multiple lines, and the parser must be able to identify and extract this text properly.\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (indented with four spaces or fenced by triple backticks) or inline code (wrapped in backticks) should not be formatted, including bold. The parser must ignore these sections when extracting bold text.\n\n7. **Links and images**: Bold syntax might be found within links or image alt-text. Deciding whether to include these as part of the extracted bold text may depend on the specific requirements of the task.\n\n8. **Performance**: If dealing with very large Markdown files, performance could become an issue, and the parser may need to be optimized for efficiency.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll know which of these challenges we'll need to address in order to extract the bold texts accurately."
