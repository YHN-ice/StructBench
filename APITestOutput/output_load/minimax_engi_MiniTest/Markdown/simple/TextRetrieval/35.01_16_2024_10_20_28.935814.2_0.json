The most common are `**bold text**` and `__bold text__`. The parser must recognize both.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could have nested elements like italics (`*italic*` or `_italic_`), code (`code`), or even links (`[link text](url)`). It's necessary to extract only the bold portion without the nested formats.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: The asterisks or underscores used for bold formatting might be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they shouldn't be parsed as formatting.\n\n4. **Irregular Formatting**: Some users may incorrectly use the bold syntax, like mismatched markers (e.g., `**bold text__`) or spacing issues (e.g., `** not bold **`).\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown can allow for bold text to span multiple lines, which might complicate extraction if the parser expects single-line formatting.\n\n6. **Literal Blocks**: Bold syntax within code blocks or inline code segments should not be treated as formatted text.\n\n7. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, users may start with a bold marker but forget to end it, which could potentially make the entire document past that point incorrectly parsed as bold.\n\nIt's important to account for these obstacles when extracting bold text to ensure accuracy in the output."
