The most common are double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` surrounding the text. It's important to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text may have other formatting nested within it, such as italics, code spans, or links. It's important to be able to discern the actual bold text from nested formatting elements.\n\n3. **Incorrect Formatting**: Sometimes, the Markdown could be incorrectly formatted, with mismatched or missing delimiters for bold text.\n\n4. **Escaped Delimiters**: Asterisks or underscores used as characters rather than formatting delimiters might be escaped with backslashes. These should not be confused with formatting delimiters.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser should be able to handle multiline formatting correctly.\n\n6. **Adjacent Formatting**: There might be other adjacent formatting elements like lists, headings, or blockquotes that could complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **Literal Text Blocks**: Code blocks or inline code might contain sequences that look like bold syntax but are meant to be displayed literally.\n\n8. **Links and Images**: The syntax for links and images may contain asterisks or underscores, potentially causing confusion if they're not handled correctly.\n\nTo handle these obstacles, the parser must be designed with a robust understanding of the Markdown syntax and possible edge cases. Now please provide the input Markdown file so I can extract the bold texts for you."
