This variability should not affect the extraction process, but we need to ensure we don't mistakenly consider it as part of the file name.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be linked using either relative paths (e.g., `./images/photo.png`) or absolute URLs (e.g., `http://example.com/image.jpg`). We must extract the file names correctly regardless of the path type.\n\n4. **Image File Extensions**: There are various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif), and we need to consider all possible image file formats that could appear in the Markdown file.\n\n5. **Markdown Variants**: Different Markdown processors might have slightly different syntax rules or extensions (like GitHub Flavored Markdown). We need to consider these potential variations.\n\n6. **Links that are not Images**: We need to differentiate between links that are actually images and those that are just URL links. This means ignoring the standard hyperlink markdown syntax which does not indicate an image (e.g., `[link text](http://url)`).\n\n7. **False Positives**: Text that might look like image syntax but isn't part of an actual image link (for example, within code blocks or comments) should be ignored.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images can be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes. The parsing logic should be able to handle these cases.\n\n9. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax may contain escaped characters that should not interfere with parsing.\n\nBy considering these potential issues in advance, we can craft a robust method to accurately extract image file names from a given Markdown file input."
