The parser must recognize both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might contain other markdown elements like italics, code, links, etc. The parser should be able to handle nested elements within the bold text without misinterpreting the content.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, the bold syntax characters might be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to display literal asterisks or underscores instead of applying formatting. The parser should distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False positives**: Text that appears to be bold due to the presence of asterisks or underscores may not be intended as bold. For example, `**` might appear in a code block or inline code, where it should not be treated as markdown formatting.\n\n5. **Partial formatting**: In some cases, an asterisk or underscore might not have a matching pair, which could lead to incomplete or incorrect formatting. The parser must validate that the syntax is correctly closed.\n\n6. **Line breaks**: Markdown may support line breaks within bold text. The parser should correctly handle bold text that spans multiple lines without breaking the formatting.\n\n7. **Overlapping formatting**: Bold syntax could potentially overlap with other formatting syntax (like strikethrough or blockquotes). The parser needs to prioritize and distinguish these formats correctly.\n\n8. **Language-specific considerations**: If the parser is designed to work with Markdown files in multiple languages, it should accommodate any language-specific characters within bold formatting.\n\n9. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is large, the parser's efficiency can become a concern. The algorithm must be optimized to handle large files without significant performance issues.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties, I can proceed to parse the Markdown file and extract the bold texts once provided with the input."
