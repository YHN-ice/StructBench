If they are relative, it may not be clear without additional context what the base path is.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image tag but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Encoded or Special Characters**: URLs within the image syntax might contain encoded characters or special characters that could complicate extraction.\n\n5. **Links vs. Images**: Distinguishing between image syntax and hyperlink syntax in Markdown, as they can look similar but serve different purposes.\n\n6. **Nested Content**: An image link could be nested within other elements, like lists or blockquotes, which could potentially complicate the extraction regex if not accounted for.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Text that looks like image syntax but isn't (e.g., examples of image syntax within code blocks).\n\n8. **File Extensions**: While typically image files have extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., sometimes image URLs might not have a clear extension, so it's important to consider this when extracting the file names.\n\nAddressing these challenges would require careful consideration of the Markdown file's structure and the application of appropriate parsing techniques, potentially including regular expressions or a full Markdown parsing library."
