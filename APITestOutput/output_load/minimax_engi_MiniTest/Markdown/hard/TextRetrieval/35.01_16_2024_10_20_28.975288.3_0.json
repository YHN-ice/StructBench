The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. Identifying all possible syntaxes is crucial.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might have other formatting nested within it, such as italicized text, links, or inline code. These could be either ignored or handled differently depending on the instructions.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Asterisks or underscores used in the text might be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**` should not be recognized as bold.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting:** There may be instances where the syntax for bold is not correctly closed, such as `**bold text`. Depending on the rules for parsing, this might be considered a formatting error and could be ignored or processed differently.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text:** Bold syntax might span multiple lines. The parser must handle line breaks within the bold formatting correctly.\n\n6. **Code Blocks:** Text within code blocks or inline code should not be interpreted as formatted text even if it contains bold syntax.\n\n7. **Lists and Blockquotes:** Bold text might appear within lists or blockquotes, and the parser should recognize and extract it correctly without considering the list or blockquote formatting as part of the bold text.\n\n8. **Performance:** If the Markdown file is particularly large, performance considerations might be necessary to ensure that the parser runs efficiently.\n\nOnce we see the input file, these challenges will dictate how we parse the Markdown content to extract the bold texts accurately."
