Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might occur during this process:\n\n1. **Variations in Image Syntax**: Markdown allows for images using the following syntax: `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. The URL part can be a path to a file or an actual URL. The variations could include inline links, reference-style links, or even HTML `<img>` tags if HTML is embedded within the Markdown.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be linked using relative paths or absolute paths. The parser must correctly identify and extract the path regardless of its form.\n\n3. **URLs vs. File Paths**: Some images might not be files but URLs to images hosted online. We need to determine if we are extracting only file names or also URLs.\n\n4. **Special Characters in File Names**: File names might contain spaces or special characters which are encoded differently in URLs. For example, spaces could be represented as `%20`.\n\n5. **Alternate Text**: Sometimes, the alternate text of an image (`Alt text`) might contain square brackets or parentheses, which can confuse a simple parser.\n\n6. **Title Attribute**: The optional title attribute might contain parentheses, which could complicate the parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n7. **Non-Image Links**: Markdown also allows for hyperlinks using a similar syntax to images. It's important to distinguish between image syntax and link syntax to avoid extracting non-image links.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Characters like `!` or `[` might be escaped in Markdown, and the parser needs to handle these cases.\n\n9. **Complex Markdown Documents**: Documents with nested structures or custom extensions could make parsing more challenging.\n\n10. **File Name Extraction Accuracy**: The parser needs to accurately extract just the file name and not any surrounding Markdown syntax or alt text.\n\nWe need to consider these possibilities and others when writing or using a Markdown parser to ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
