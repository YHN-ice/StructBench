For example, `![alt text](image.jpg)`. Identifying this pattern is key to extracting image file names.\n\n2. **Variations in Image Syntax**: Markdown allows some variations in how images are included. There might be optional title attributes within the parentheses after the image URL, or there might be reference-style links where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be absolute URLs or relative to the location of the Markdown file. It's important to identify just the file names, regardless of the path.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs and Spaces**: URLs can be percent-encoded, and spaces in URLs can be represented by `%20` or plus signs. These would need to be decoded or translated to accurately reflect the file name.\n\n5. **Different File Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions, including but not limited to `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. The parser should recognize all common image extensions.\n\n6. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also include raw HTML. If images are embedded using HTML tags like `<img>`, these should also be detected if we're looking for all included images.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some flavors of Markdown add extensions to the base syntax which could affect how images are included, such as Markdown Extra or GitHub Flavored Markdown.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Text that resembles the image syntax but isn't an actual image reference (like an exclamation mark followed by a series of non-image characters) should be filtered out.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, the parsing logic must be robust enough to account for all these scenarios and flexible enough to handle different Markdown flavors and conventions."
