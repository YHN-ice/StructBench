There could be variations in how bold text is marked up, and the parser needs to recognize all valid forms.\n\n2. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Bold text might have nested elements like links `[link](url)`, italics, or even inline code blocks `` `code` `` within it. Extracting only the bold text while handling or excluding the nested elements could be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the characters used for bold syntax (e.g., asterisks `*`, underscores `_`) might be escaped with a backslash to display them as literal characters instead of formatting, like `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`. The parser must distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might not follow the Markdown syntax correctly, leading to inconsistent formatting, such as `**bold not closed properly`, which could confuse the parser.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and depending on how the parser is implemented, it could have difficulty detecting multiline bold text if it processes line by line.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Bold syntax within code blocks (indented by four spaces or fenced by ````` ` `````) should not be parsed as bold text because they are meant to display raw code.\n\nTo handle these cases, the parser must be robust and have clear rules to identify all variations of bold text correctly while ignoring false positives."
