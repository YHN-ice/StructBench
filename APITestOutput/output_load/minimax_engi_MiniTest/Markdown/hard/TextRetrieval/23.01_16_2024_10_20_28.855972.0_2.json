However, variations and extensions like reference-style images, HTML image tags, or images with additional attributes (like title or width/height) could be present.\n\n2. **Inline vs. Reference Style**: Images can be included inline with their URLs or using reference-style links where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document. Both cases need to be handled.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. It's important to extract the exact path as it appears in the Markdown file.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Sometimes, what appears to be an image syntax might actually be a link or formatted text that resembles the image syntax.\n\n5. **Encoded or Special URLs**: URLs may contain special characters or be URL-encoded, which can make pattern matching more challenging.\n\n6. **Non-standard Extensions**: Markdown has several flavors and non-standard extensions that might introduce non-conventional ways to include images.\n\n7. **Nested Content**: Sometimes, images might be nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes, which could affect simple regex-based approaches.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There could be multiple images on a single line, each needing to be extracted.\n\n9. **Escape Characters**: Some image links may include escape characters that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n10. **Identifying File Names**: Once the image URLs are extracted, we need to ensure we only obtain the file names, not the full URLs, if that's what's required.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, a robust parsing approach that can handle various cases and exceptions is necessary to accurately extract all included image file names from the Markdown content provided."
