We must ensure that we recognize all valid Markdown syntax for bold formatting.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text in Markdown may contain other formatting, such as italic (`*italic*` or `_italic_`), strikethrough (`~~strikethrough~~`), or inline code (`\\`code\\``). These nested formats can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escaping characters**: Asterisks and underscores can be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to be treated as literal characters rather than formatting syntax. We need to differentiate between actual bold syntax and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False positives**: There might be occurrences where double asterisks or underscores don't constitute bold text, such as in code blocks where they are meant to be taken literally. We need to ignore those cases.\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text may span multiple lines, which requires recognizing the syntax across line breaks.\n\n6. **Partially formatted text**: Situations might arise where the syntax for bold is not properly closed, leading to ambiguity about what text is intended to be bold.\n\n7. **Overlapping syntax**: Occasionally, you might encounter overlapping formatting syntax, where two different formatting styles start and end within each other. Proper parsing requires identifying the correct scopes of each.\n\nGiven these potential issues, it would be necessary to parse the Markdown content carefully, recognizing the context and hierarchies of formatting to accurately extract only the bold texts."
