Recognizing which links are image files would require understanding the syntax that identifies image links within the content.\n\n2. **Variety of Formats:** Image files can come in multiple formats (e.g., jpg, png, gif). The parser must be able to recognize all the different formats that might be included.\n\n3. **Inline Display Syntax:** ORG mode has specific syntax for displaying images inline (using `[[file:path/to/image.jpg]]`). The parser should be capable of identifying this syntax as well.\n\n4. **External vs. Embedded Images:** The parser may need to distinguish between images that are hosted externally (via a URL) and those that are stored locally (with a relative or absolute file path).\n\n5. **Image References in Different Contexts:** Images could be referenced within different contexts in the file, such as within a description, a list, or a table, and the parser must handle all such occurrences.\n\n6. **File Path Variations:** File paths can be absolute, relative, or might use different path separators depending on the operating system. The parser should correctly interpret these paths to extract the filenames.\n\n7. **Link Descriptions:** In ORG files, links can have descriptions, and the syntax can look like `[[file:path/to/image.jpg][description]]`. The parser needs to identify the actual link and not be confused by the description text.\n\n8. **Syntax Variations:** There might be variations in the link syntax or whitespace characters that need to be accounted for to ensure reliable parsing.\n\n9. **Incorrectly Formatted Links:** If there are any formatting errors in how image links are included in the ORG file, the parser might miss these or incorrectly identify non-image elements as images.\n\nIf you're ready with your ORG file content, please provide it so we can attempt to extract the image filenames."
