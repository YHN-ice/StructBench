Identifying this pattern amidst other content can be challenging without a clear parsing strategy.\n\n2. **Embedded Formatting**: Bold text might be embedded within other formatting (like italic, underlined, or code blocks), which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Nested Bold Tags**: Bold text could be nested within itself or other bold text, making the parsing logic to extract them more complex.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Special characters within the bold text or adjacent to the bold syntax markers could disrupt the identification of the bold text.\n\n5. **Inconsistencies in Formatting**: If the document has inconsistencies in how bold is applied, such as missing closing asterisks, it can lead to incorrect extractions.\n\n6. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text that spans multiple lines might need special consideration, as line breaks could be interpreted as the end of the formatting.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I can give a more precise answer.
