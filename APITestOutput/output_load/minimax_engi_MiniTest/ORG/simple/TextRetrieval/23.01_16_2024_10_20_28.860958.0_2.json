Each of these would require a different parsing strategy.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be included with either relative or absolute paths. While extracting the file names, it's important to differentiate between the path and the actual file name.\n\n3. **Variety of Image Formats**: There could be multiple image formats such as .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc. The parser needs to account for all the possible image extensions.\n\n4. **Non-Image File Links**: The ORG file might contain links to non-image files, and these should be distinguished and excluded from the output.\n\n5. **Link Syntax Errors**: There might be syntax errors in how images are linked in the ORG file (like missing brackets or incorrect file paths), which could make it harder to accurately identify and extract image file names.\n\n6. **Embedded Image Data**: Sometimes, images could be embedded directly in base64 encoding rather than being linked as separate files. These would not have traditional file names and could complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Comments or Inactive Links**: Some links might be commented out or placed in sections of the ORG file that are not meant to be parsed (like archive sections or footnotes). It would be necessary to ignore these.\n\n8. **Multiple Links on One Line**: There could be multiple image links on a single line, so the parser should be able to handle that as well.\n\nThe parser must be designed to handle these potential issues effectively to ensure that all and only image file names are correctly extracted from the ORG file."
