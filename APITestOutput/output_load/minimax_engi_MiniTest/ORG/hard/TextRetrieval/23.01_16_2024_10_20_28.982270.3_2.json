Handling all these cases can be challenging.\n\n3. **Markup Confusion**: ORG mode allows for rich markup, which might include comments or other non-image file links that could be confused with image file inclusions.\n\n4. **Embedded Image Data**: Instead of linking to image files, the ORG document could potentially contain embedded base64-encoded image data, which does not have traditional file names.\n\n5. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There could be lines with multiple images included, and the parser must be able to extract each one individually.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Identifying what constitutes an image file might require checking for various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif).\n\n7. **Filtering Non-image Links**: It's possible to have links to non-image files (e.g., .pdf, .docx) that the parser must ignore, focusing only on image file links.\n\n8. **Encapsulation in Markup**: Image links might be encapsulated in other markup elements like lists, tables, or even source blocks.\n\n9. **Escape Characters**: Some image links might include escape characters or special characters that need to be handled correctly.\n\n10. **Link Descriptions**: ORG files allow for link descriptions which might include additional text that is not part of the file name.\n\nTo handle these challenges effectively, the parser should be carefully designed to recognize and extract image file names accurately while accounting for the variety of ways images can be included in ORG files."
