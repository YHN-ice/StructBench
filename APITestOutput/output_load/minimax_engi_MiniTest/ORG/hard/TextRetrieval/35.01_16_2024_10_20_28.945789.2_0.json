Identifying all the possible markup styles for bold text is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links, code blocks, or italicized text. Properly parsing the text to extract only the bold portions without including surrounding formatting can be challenging.\n\n3. **Partial Bold Text**: Sometimes, only part of a sentence or a word might be bold. It's important to extract only the portions that are bold, without including additional non-bold text.\n\n4. **Escaped Formatting Characters**: Users can escape formatting characters to display them as literals rather than formatting. For example, a user might write \\*not bold\\* intending to show the asterisks rather than bolding the text. Distinguishing between actual formatting and escaped characters is necessary.\n\n5. **Different Line Structures**: Bold text can be on a single line, span multiple lines, or be part of a list or a heading. Accounting for these variations is important for accurate extraction.\n\n6. **File Size and Complexity**: Large ORG files with extensive formatting may slow down the parsing process, and complex files with a lot of nested structures may complicate pattern matching.\n\n7. **Incorrect Markup**: Users might make mistakes in their markup that could cause incorrect parsing, such as unmatched asterisks or missing closing tags.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the process of extracting bold texts needs to be handled with care to ensure accuracy and completeness."
