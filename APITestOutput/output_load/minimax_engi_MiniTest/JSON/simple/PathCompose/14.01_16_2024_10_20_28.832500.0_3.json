Mistaking an object for an array or vice versa can lead to errors.\n\n6. **Errors in JSON Format**: If the JSON is not well-formed (e.g., missing commas, brackets, or quotes), parsing may fail.\n\n7. **Large Files**: Parsing and navigating through a very large JSON file can be cumbersome and might require efficient searching algorithms or tools.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is encoded in a different format than expected, it could cause issues when parsing.\n\n9. **Version and Compatibility Issues**: Different JSON parsers may have varying levels of compliance with the JSON standard, which could affect how they handle certain structures within the JSON file.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one should:\n- Carefully inspect the structure of the JSON.\n- Use proper tools or libraries for parsing JSON.\n- Handle exceptions and check for errors during parsing.\n- Be cautious when accessing elements to ensure correct use of keys and indices."
