Navigating these structures requires careful attention to the hierarchy and paths.\n\n2. **Array Indexing**: If the desired value is within an array, it is important to know the correct index to access that value. Arrays are zero-indexed, so the first element is at index 0.\n\n3. **Key Names**: JSON objects are composed of key-value pairs. To access a value, one must know the exact key name, which is case-sensitive.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports different data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. The way you access a value might differ depending on its type (e.g., using an index for arrays, or a key name for objects).\n\n5. **Incorrect Path**: Specifying an incorrect path by either missing a necessary key or index or by adding an unnecessary one would result in an error or returning an undefined value.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: While composing the access path, syntax errors like missing brackets, quotes around string keys, or incorrect punctuation could also prevent successful parsing.\n\n7. **Dynamic Data**: If the structure of the JSON data is not consistent or known beforehand, writing a static path to access the value could be challenging.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles:\n\n- Ensure familiarity with the JSON structure and hierarchy.\n- Check for the correct type of each element (object, array, etc.) before trying to access it.\n- Use precise key names and array indices.\n- Validate path syntax to avoid errors.\n- Handle dynamic data structures with conditional checks or by using methods that can handle variability (like iterating over keys or indices)."
