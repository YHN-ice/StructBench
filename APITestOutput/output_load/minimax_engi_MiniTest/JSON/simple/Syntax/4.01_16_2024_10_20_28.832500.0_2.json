Missing or extra commas can cause a parsing error.\n\n2. **Improper Quotation Marks**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes or missing quotes can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Data Type Issues**: JSON values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null. Incorrectly formatted data types (like missing quotes around strings) will result in an error.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in arrays or objects, JSON does not permit this, and it will cause an error.\n\n5. **Syntax Mistakes**: Any deviation from the correct syntax (such as using an equals sign instead of a colon between keys and values) will result in a parsing error.\n\n6. **Nested Objects/Arrays**: If the JSON contains nested objects or arrays, there is a higher chance of missing or extra brackets or braces that could lead to errors.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: The file encoding could potentially cause issues if special characters are not properly represented.\n\n8. **Large File Size**: A large JSON file may make it difficult to spot errors manually and could require automated tools to validate.\n\n9. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, so including them can cause errors.\n\n10. **Unescaped Characters**: Special characters within strings must be properly escaped, otherwise they can cause parsing errors.\n\nIt is important to carefully parse and validate the JSON structure to identify any such issues that could indicate structural errors."
