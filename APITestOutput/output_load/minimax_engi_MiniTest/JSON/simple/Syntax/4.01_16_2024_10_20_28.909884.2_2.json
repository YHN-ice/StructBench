Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the correct parsing of a JSON file:\n\n1. **Missing or Extra Commas**: JSON requires commas between elements in an array or between members in an object. A missing or an extra comma is a common error.\n\n2. **Improper Quotes**: JSON keys and string values must be surrounded by double quotes. Single quotes, no quotes, or mismatched quotes will cause an error.\n\n3. **Trailing Commas**: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas, JSON does not permit a comma after the last element in an array or the last member in an object.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues**: JSON has a strict set of allowed data types, and any deviation from these types (e.g., functions or date objects) would cause an error.\n\n5. **Nested Object and Array Issues**: Improper nesting or mismatched brackets can lead to errors.\n\n6. **Encoding Problems**: JSON text must be encoded in Unicode, such as UTF-8, and any encoding errors can cause issues.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: These include issues like using `=` instead of `:` to assign values to keys or using JavaScript comments which are not allowed in JSON.\n\n8. **Unexpected Characters**: Any character outside of the JSON structure (e.g., a random character at the beginning or end of the file) will lead to parsing errors. \n\nOnce the JSON input file is provided, I would be able to check for these kinds of errors and determine if the JSON is structurally sound or not."
