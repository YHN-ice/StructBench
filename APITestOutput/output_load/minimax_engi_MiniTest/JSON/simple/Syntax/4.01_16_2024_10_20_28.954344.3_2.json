Common mistakes include missing or extra commas, quotes, braces, or brackets.\n2. **Data Types:** JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Mistakes can occur if the wrong data type is used for a value.\n3. **Nested Structures:** JSON can contain nested structures like objects within objects or arrays within objects. Errors can occur if the nesting is not done correctly.\n4. **Key-Value Pairs:** In JSON objects, data is represented in key-value pairs. An error could arise if there's a missing key or value, or if they are not properly separated by a colon.\n5. **Encoding Issues:** JSON files should be encoded in UTF-8 without BOM (Byte Order Mark). Encoding issues might cause parsing errors.\n\nTo determine if there are structural errors in the JSON file, it is necessary to validate the file against these potential issues. Please provide the JSON file so I can proceed with parsing and validation."
