Objects with no further nested lists or dictionaries can still contain these other types.\n\n3. **Multiple Paths**: There could be multiple paths to different objects that are equally deeply nested, so the parser must be able to identify all such instances, not just the first one it encounters.\n\n4. **Recursion Complexity**: Recursive approaches are commonly used to traverse nested structures, which can lead to complexity in managing state and returning the correct information from different levels of recursion.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is large, it could be difficult to process it efficiently without running into memory or performance issues.\n\n6. **Identifying Non-List/Dict Values**: When looking for the most deeply nested objects without list or dict values, the parser must be able to differentiate these from other types and ensure that only the deepest non-list/dict objects are extracted.\n\n7. **Formatting Output**: Properly formatting the output to match the given requirement (e.g., separating excerpts by `\\n\\n`) while maintaining the original structure from the JSON file.\n\n8. **Incomplete or Malformed JSON**: The parser might encounter JSON that is incomplete or not properly formatted, which could cause errors during parsing.\n\nUnderstanding and handling these challenges will be essential for providing the correct answer to questions about the most deeply nested objects in a JSON file.
