Multiple objects with the same id: If the JSON file contains multiple objects with the same id 'i', it might be unclear which one is being referred to without additional context.\n\n3.

Ambiguous key names: If 'id' is not a distinct key and appears in various places or levels within the JSON structure, it might be ambiguous as to which 'id' reference is the correct one.\n\n6. Non-standard data representations: If the JSON file uses non-standard conventions for representing data (e.g., unconventional date formats or custom data types), interpreting the desired information might be more difficult.\n\n7.
