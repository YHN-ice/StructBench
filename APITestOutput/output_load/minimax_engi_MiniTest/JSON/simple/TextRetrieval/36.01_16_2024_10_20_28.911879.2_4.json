Automated parsing will be necessary.\n\n2. **Consistent Recognition of Objects**: It's essential to correctly identify what constitutes an object (in JSON, an object is a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`) and ensure that lists (enclosed in square brackets `[]`) and other dictionaries (nested objects) are not counted as final objects.\n\n3. **Consistency in Depth Measurement**: The method used to measure the depth of the nesting must be consistent. The depth of an object is typically the number of curly brace pairs `{}` that must be traversed to reach it from the root of the document.\n\n4. **Multiple Objects at Same Depth**: There could be multiple objects that are equally deeply nested, and all of them would need to be identified and returned in the response.\n\n5. **Formatting of Excerpt**: The output format for these nested objects may need to preserve the original formatting from the JSON file to ensure they are represented accurately.\n\n6. **JSON Validity**: The JSON must be valid. If there are issues like missing brackets or commas, parsing would fail until these issues are resolved.\n\nOnce I have access to the JSON input file, I can use a systematic approach to parse through the file and provide you with the most deeply nested objects in the format you requested."
