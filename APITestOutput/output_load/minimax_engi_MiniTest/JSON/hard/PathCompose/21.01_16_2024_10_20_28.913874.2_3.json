Nested Structures: JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays, which can make it challenging to determine the correct path to a value. It's important to understand the hierarchy and how deeply a value is nested.\n\n2. Array Indices: If the value is within an array, identifying the correct index is crucial. A common obstacle is not accounting for zero-based indexing, where the first element is at index 0.\n\n3. Similar Keys: JSON objects may have keys that are named similarly or even identically (in different scopes). This can cause confusion in determining the correct path.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: Mistyping keys or indices can lead to incorrect paths and failure to access the desired value.\n\n5. Dynamic Structures: If the structure of the JSON is not known beforehand or if it changes dynamically, it can be difficult to generalize a method for accessing values.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: JSON keys are case-sensitive. Using the wrong case may result in failure to retrieve the value.\n\n7. Data Types: Confusion between different data types (e.g., an integer index versus a string key) can lead to errors in forming the path.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful analysis of the JSON structure, attention to detail, and understanding of JSON syntax are necessary.
