A common error is forgetting to place a comma between elements or adding an extra comma at the end of a list.\n\n2. **Incorrect Brackets**: Braces `{}` are used for objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays. It's crucial to open and close these correctly and to use the right type for the data structure being represented.\n\n3. **Unquoted Strings**: In JSON, keys (and string values) must always be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an object or array.\n\n5. **Data Types Errors**: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). Errors can occur if these are not correctly represented (e.g., strings not in double quotes, or booleans written incorrectly).\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file includes special characters, they must be properly encoded. Otherwise, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Incorrect Nesting**: Objects and arrays can be nested within each other. An error can occur if the nesting is not structured correctly.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: Any deviation from the JSON format's strict syntax rules (like missing quotes around keys) would result in a structural error.\n\nOnce I am provided with the actual JSON input, I can look for these potential issues to determine if there are any structural errors present in the file."
