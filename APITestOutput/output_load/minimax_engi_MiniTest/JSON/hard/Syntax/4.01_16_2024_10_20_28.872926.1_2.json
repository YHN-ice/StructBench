If a comma is missing, this will cause an error.\n\n2. **Extra commas:** Conversely, having an extra comma after the last element in an object or array is also not allowed in JSON.\n\n3. **Improper quotes:** JSON requires double quotes for strings and object keys. Single quotes or the absence of quotes will result in an error.\n\n4. **Trailing commas:** Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in arrays and objects, JSON does not permit this.\n\n5. **Mismatched brackets/braces:** Every opening brace `{` must have a corresponding closing brace `}`, and every opening bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing bracket `]`.\n\n6. **Unescaped characters:** Certain characters like newline characters, tabs, or double quotes inside strings need to be escaped with a backslash `\\`.\n\n7. **Incorrect data types:** JSON values can only be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null. If an unsupported data type is used, it will result in an error.\n\n8. **Colon instead of comma:** Sometimes colons are mistakenly used to separate elements in an array or properties in an object, which should instead be separated by commas.\n\n9. **Nested errors:** Errors can also occur within nested objects or arrays if the inner JSON structures have any of the above issues.\n\nOnce I view the actual JSON file content, I can determine whether any of these common issues or others are present."
