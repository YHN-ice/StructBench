Ensuring that these are correctly interpreted is essential for accurate parsing.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is large, it could be cumbersome to locate specific information without proper querying mechanisms.\n\n6. **Ambiguous Keys**: Sometimes YAML files might have keys that appear multiple times at different levels of the hierarchy, which can be ambiguous without context.\n\n7. **Encoding**: If the file uses a character encoding that's not properly handled, it could lead to incorrect parsing of values.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML content, I can address these potential issues and parse the file to answer your question about the first object's `id` in `subs`."
