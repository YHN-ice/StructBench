Without additional context to specify which one is being referred to, there may be ambiguity.\n\n3. **Inheritance and References**: YAML supports node references and inheritance. If the object with id 'p' inherits properties from another object or is referenced elsewhere in the document, it may require resolving those references to fully understand the content of the object.\n\n4. **Syntactical Issues**: YAML is sensitive to indentation and formatting. If there are syntactical issues in the file, it can lead to parsing errors, making it hard to accurately read the content.\n\n5. **Size of the Document**: If the YAML file is extremely large, it might be challenging to efficiently find the relevant section without a search capability.\n\n6. **Variations in Key Representation**: Sometimes keys in YAML can be represented in multiple ways (e.g., with or without quotes). Consistency issues might make it harder to search for specific keys.\n\n7. **Comments and Documentation**: If the YAML file contains a lot of comments or documentation strings, these might clutter the view and make it harder to find the relevant object without an ability to filter them out.\n\n8. **Non-standard Extensions**: If the YAML file uses non-standard extensions or custom tags, it might not be possible to correctly interpret them without additional information on how these extensions should be handled.\n\n9. **External References**: The YAML file might reference external files or include external content that isn't directly visible within the document being parsed.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: If the file has encoding issues or includes special characters, this might affect the parsing process.\n\nOnce I have access to the input YAML content, I can better address these potential obstacles and provide an accurate representation of the object with id 'p'."
