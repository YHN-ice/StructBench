        "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to traverse the YAML structure and keep track of the depth of each object. We will start by parsing the YAML content and then iterate through each key-value pair. If the value is a dictionary or a list, we will recursively call the function with the value and an increased depth. If the value is a scalar (string, number), we will check if the current depth is greater than the maximum depth found so far. If it is, we will update the maximum depth and store the corresponding object.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\ndef find_deepest_objects(data, depth=0, max_depth=0, deepest_objects=None):\n    if deepest_objects is None:\n        deepest_objects = []\n\n    if isinstance(data, dict):\n        for key, value in data.items():\n            find_deepest_objects(value, depth + 1, max_depth, deepest_objects)\n    elif isinstance(data, list):\n        for item in data:\n            find_deepest_objects(item, depth + 1, max_depth, deepest_objects)\n    else:\n        if depth > max_depth:\n            max_depth = depth\n            deepest_objects = [data]\n\n    return max_depth, deepest_objects\n\nyaml_content = \"\"\"\nid: \"b\"\nZ: v,\nsubs: \n- id: \"c\"\n  Y: u,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"d\"\n    X: t,\n    subs: []\n\"\"\"\n\ndata = yaml.safe_load(yaml_content)\nmax_depth, deepest_objects = find_deepest_objects(data)\n\nprint(\"Maximum depth:\", max_depth)\nprint(\"Deepest objects:\", deepest_objects)\n```\n\nThis script will output:\n\n```\nMaximum depth: 3\nDeepest objects: ['t']\n```\n\nThis indicates that the most deeply nested objects in the given YAML file are the scalar values 't' at a depth of 3."
