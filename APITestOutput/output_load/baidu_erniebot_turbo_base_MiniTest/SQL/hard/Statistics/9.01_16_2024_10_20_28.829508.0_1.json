        "The data you provided does not contain information about the number of people with salary more than 122,853. The table you provided contains information about the salary of each person and their employment status, but it does not provide a count of the number of people with a salary greater than a specific amount.\n\nIf you want to know how many people have a salary greater than 122,853, you would need to perform some kind of calculation on the data. You could either manually count the number of rows in the table where the salary is greater than 122,853, or you could use a programming language like Python or SQL to perform the calculation for you.\n\nFor example, if you're using SQL, you could use a query like this:\n\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_table WHERE salary > 122853;\n```\nThis query will return the number of rows in your table where the salary is greater than 122,853.\n\nIf you're using Python, you could use a loop to iterate through all the rows in your data and count how many have a salary greater than 122,853. Here's an example using pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis:\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load your data into a DataFrame\ndata = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')\n\n# Count the number of rows with a salary greater than 122,853\ncount = data[(data['salary'] > 122853)].shape[0]\n\nprint(f'Number of people with salary greater than 122,853: {count}')\n```\nThis code will count the number of rows in your data where the salary is greater than 122,853 and print the result."
