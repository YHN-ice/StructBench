        "Your input appears to be in the format of a YAML document. A YAML document can have arbitrarily nested structures, which means there's no maximum nesting level, so long as your computer can handle it. But based on your question, you're asking for the most deeply nested object, which is an object that doesn't have a list or dict as its value.\n\nIn your input, the most deeply nested object is:\n\n\n```yaml\nsubs: \n- id: \"f\"\n  X: d,\n  subs: []\n```\nThis object has a depth of 3 levels, where it has a `subs` key with a value of another object that also has a `subs` key with an empty list as its value. The root object (`subs`) is a key in a dictionary, which is a key in a list. The innermost object (`subs` key's value) doesn't have a list or dictionary as its value, so it's the most deeply nested object that doesn't have a list or dict as its value.\n\nIf you want to extract this object and its content, you can use the following YAML parser and extractor:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\n# Read the YAML file\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n\n# Extract the deeply nested object\nnested_object = data['subs'][0]\nprint(nested_object)\n```\nMake sure to replace `'your_file.yaml'` with the actual path to your YAML file. This will print out the deeply nested object and its content to your console.\n\nPlease note that if your YAML file is large or contains complex structures, you may need to use a more powerful YAML parser or toolkit like PyYAML or ruamel.yaml to handle it efficiently."
