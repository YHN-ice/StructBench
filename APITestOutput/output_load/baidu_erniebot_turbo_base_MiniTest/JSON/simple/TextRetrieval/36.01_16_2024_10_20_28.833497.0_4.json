        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it doesn't contain any list or dict values at the deepest level. The deepest level object is \"subs\" in the \"subs\" array of the main object. Here's an excerpt of the JSON content, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"g\",\n  \"Z\": \"z\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"h\",\n      \"Y\": \"y\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"i\",\n          \"X\": \"x\",\n          \"subs\": {\n            // No list or dict values here\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to access this deepest level object and its contents, you can use a recursive function or a library like `deep_get` from `python-json-utils` to retrieve the value. Here's an example using `deep_get`:\n\n\n```python\nfrom json_utils import deep_get\n\njson_str = \"\"\"... your json string ...\"\"\"  # your json string here\nobj = json.loads(json_str)\n\nvalue = deep_get(obj, \"subs[0].subs[0].subs\")  # access the deepest level object\nprint(value)  # prints the value of the deepest level object\n```\nMake sure to replace `... your json string ...` with your actual JSON string. This code will output the value of the deepest level object, which in this case is an empty dictionary `{}`. If you want to access nested keys in a list, you can modify the `deep_get` function accordingly."
