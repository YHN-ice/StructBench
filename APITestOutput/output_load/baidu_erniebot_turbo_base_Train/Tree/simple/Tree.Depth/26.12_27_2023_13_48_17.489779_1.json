We keep this count until we reach a node that directly links to node t or that cannot go any further from the current position.\n\nStarting from t, there are a few nodes (sc, cb, and s) that can take you closer to t (s->t), and so their depth count is 0 (since they are already in the same path as t). Other nodes that lead away from t's path increase the depth count. The node c->fb is one such node that increases the depth by 1. This process continues until we reach node x, which directly links to t (q->x). x is a terminal node that has no more paths leading to it, so its depth count becomes the depth of t. In this case, the depth of x is 6. The final node s->w increases the depth count by 1, and since s->w is the last path leading to t, the depth of t is 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is 7."
