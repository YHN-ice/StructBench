        "In this question, you are given a tree and you are asked to find the height of the root node and the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf nodes. Height of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root node to that node.\n\nTo find the height of the root node, you can simply follow the path from the root node to any leaf node. The height of the root node is the maximum height of any leaf node plus 1. In this case, we need to follow paths through 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', ..., 'mc', 'nc', ..., 'wc' to reach any leaf node. The maximum height of any leaf node is 0, so the height of the root node is 1 + the maximum height of any leaf node.\n\nTo find the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node, you can follow the path from the root node to a leaf node and count the number of edges along that path. In this case, we need to follow paths through 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', ..., 'mc', 'nc', ..., 'rb' to reach a leaf node.\n\nHere are the answers:\n\n* The height of the root node is 4.\n* The number of edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf nodes is 7 (paths through 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', ..., 'rb').\n\nNote: This assumes that you have correctly identified all nodes and edges in the given tree.
