The root node is e, which has 3 edges leading to f, f, and ab.\n2. The longest path from e to any leaf node starts from f, then continues to g, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u and v. So, it has 11 edges (f->g), (g->j), (j->k), (k->l), (l->m), (m->n), (n->o), (o->p), (p->q), (q->r), (r->s), (s->t), (t->u) and (u->v).\n3.
