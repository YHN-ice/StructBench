The root node is d, and it has 6 edges leading to leaf nodes. The height of a node is the number of edges in the longest path from that node to any leaf node.

It seems that this input graph is provided as a list of strings in which each string represents an edge (starting from d) in the graph. The number of edges in the longest path from any node to any leaf node is 6 because it involves nodes d -> e -> f -> g -> h -> i (in terms of letters in the alphabet).\n\nI hope this information helps you!
