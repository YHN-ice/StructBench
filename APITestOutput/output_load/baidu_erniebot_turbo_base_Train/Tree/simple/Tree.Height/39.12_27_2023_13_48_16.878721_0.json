        "To answer your question, you need to find the height of the root node and the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.\n\nThe height of the root node is 0, because it is the root of the tree.\n\nTo find the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start from the root node.\n2. Follow all edges until you reach a leaf node.\n3. Return the number of edges traversed in this path.\n\nThe following steps assume that each node is a tuple where the first element is the edge to go to the next node and the second element is the destination node.\n\nHere's how you can calculate it:\n\n* m -> n -> o -> p -> q -> r -> s -> t -> u -> v -> w -> x -> y -> z -> ab -> bc -> cc -> dc -> ec -> fc -> gc -> ic -> jc -> nc -> oc -> pc -> qc -> rc -> sc -> tc -> ub -> vc -> wc -> xc\n* The longest path from m to any leaf node is: m->n->o->p->q->r->s->t->y->z->ab->bc->cc->dc->ec->jc->nc->oc->pc->qc->rd\n* It contains 9 edges.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9.
