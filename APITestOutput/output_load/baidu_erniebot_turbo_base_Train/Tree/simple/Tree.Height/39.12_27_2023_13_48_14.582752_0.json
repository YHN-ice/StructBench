The longest path from the root node to any leaf node has 9 edges.\n\nHere's an explanation of how I calculated these values:\n\n* The root node is f.\n* There are 5 nodes below f (g, h, i, j, and k), and each of these nodes has 2 children (m, n, o, p, q). Therefore, the height of f is 5 - 1 = 4.\n* The longest path from f to any leaf node is from f to mb->nb->ob->pb->qb->rb. This path has 5 edges.\n* If you add up all the edges in the longest path, you get 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 27 edges.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4 and 27."
