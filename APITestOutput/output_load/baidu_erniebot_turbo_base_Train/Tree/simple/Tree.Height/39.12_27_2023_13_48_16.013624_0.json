        "The height of the root node is 2, and the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node is 9.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe tree contains nodes q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, ab, bb, cb, db, eb, fb, gc, hb, ib, jb, kb, lb, mb, nb, pb, rb, sb, tb, ub, vc, wc, xb, yb, zb, ad, bd, cd and dd. The root node (q) has 2 edges leading to it: r and x. The height of the root node is the maximum distance from the root to any leaf node. In this case, the longest path from q to any leaf node is through r->s->t->u->v->w->x->y->z->ab->bb->cb->db->eb->fb->gc. This path has 9 edges.\n\nThe height of the tree is equal to the maximum height of any node in the tree. In this case, the height of any node is 2 or less because all nodes are connected to their parent by at most 2 edges.\n\nPlease note that I assumed that the input tree represented a binary tree because it only had nodes that were either leaves or had only one child. If the input represented a different type of tree (e.g., a ternary tree), then the answer would be different."
