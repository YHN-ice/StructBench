The root node (v) has 3 edges to reach its children (w, x, and rb).\n2. The maximum length path from any leaf node (be it in v's subtree or outside) to v is through rb (where it is pathologically stretched), hence it includes edges for x->rb, v->rb, rb->xb and rb->sb. The number of these edges is 4.\n3. Adding the edges from v to its children, and from its children to each other, we get a total of 7 edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf node.\n\nTherefore, the height of the root node is 3, and the number of edges in the longest path from root node to any leaf node is 7.\n\nNote: The height of a node is the length of the longest path from that node to any leaf node.
