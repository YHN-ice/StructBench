The root node is y, which has 2 children: z and ub.\n2. The height of y is the number of edges from y to any leaf node. In this case, there are 2 edges going from y to z and from y to ub. The maximum length path is formed by y->z->ac->ec, which has 4 edges.\n3. Therefore, the height of y is 3.\n4. For the longest path from the root node to any leaf node, we follow the path y->z->ab->bb, which has 5 edges. Then we follow z->fb->gb->hb->ib, which has 5 edges, and finally we follow fb->jc, which has 1 edge. So, the total number of edges is 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer you provided is correct."
