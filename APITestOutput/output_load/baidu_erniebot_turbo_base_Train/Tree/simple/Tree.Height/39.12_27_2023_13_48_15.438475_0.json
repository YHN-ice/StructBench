        "According to the given input, the height of the root node is 3.\n\nThe longest path from the root node to any leaf node has a total of 7 edges. The root node is connected to nodes s, t, u, v, w, x, and y. Then, from node y, it is connected to nodes ab, bb, cb, and z. Finally, from node z it is connected to nodes ac, bc, cc, and possibly ad, bd, and cd.\n\nSo the height of the root node is the number of edges in the longest path (7 edges), plus the height of each of the leaf nodes (which are all at height 0). The height of each leaf node is 0 so we add 0*7 = 0 to the total number of edges to get the height of the root node, which is 7 + 0 = 3.\n\nSo the answer is 3."
