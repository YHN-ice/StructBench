        "This is a tree data structure, which has many leaves (the height of leaves is 0). Based on the input provided, the root node has a maximum depth of 6.\n\nHere's how to calculate it:\n\n* There are 5 edges leading to m (m->n, n->o, n->p, n->q, m->s).\n* Then there are 7 edges leading to s (s->t, s->u, s->v, s->w, m->x, x->y, x->z).\n* After that, there are 5 edges leading to x (x->ab, x->bb, m->cb, cb->db, cb->eb).\n* The next edge is from cb to n (cb->fb), which counts as part of the path from m to n.\n* The last edge is from l to cc (l->dc), which also counts as part of the path from m to n.\n\nSo the total number of edges from m to any leaf node is 5 + 7 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 19. The height of the root node is therefore 6.\n\nPlease note that this answer assumes that each edge is counted only once. If you allow for multiple edges between nodes, then the height would be less than 6."
