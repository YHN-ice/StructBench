        "The data provided does not include the total number of people employed in the company with a salary greater than 264,829. It is unclear from the provided data how many people are employed at a particular salary range within each company. You will need to query each company's database to determine the total number of employees with a salary greater than 264,829.\n\nIf you have access to the company's database, you can use a query or search function to retrieve the total number of employees with a salary greater than 264,829 for each company. You can also filter the data based on the salary range and add it to the results to calculate the total number of people who make more than 264,829.\n\nFor example, you can use the following SQL query to retrieve the total number of employees for a particular company:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee WHERE salary > 264829 AND company = 'CompanyName';\n```\n\nReplace 'CompanyName' with the name of the company you are interested in. This query will return the total number of employees who make more than 264,829 for that company. You can repeat this process for each company to get the total number of people employed in the company with a salary greater than 264,829.\n\nPlease note that if you do not have access to the company's database, you will need to contact the company's HR department or human resources representative to obtain this information."
