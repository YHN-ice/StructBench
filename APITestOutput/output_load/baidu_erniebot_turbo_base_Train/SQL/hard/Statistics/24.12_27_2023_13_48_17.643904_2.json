Therefore, approximately 6/9 = 66.67% of people in the table are female.\n\nHere's how you can calculate this:\n\n- The total number of people is 9 (primeKey column)\n- You are asking about the number of female people. So, we need to look at the gender column (gender).\n- You mentioned \"female\" in the question, so we will only count those rows where gender is female.\n- There are 6 rows where gender is female, so we can say that approximately 6/9 = 66.67% of people in the table are female.\n\nThe above mentioned calculations were done by manually reviewing the data. If you have a large dataset, it's recommended to use a statistical method to calculate the percentage."
