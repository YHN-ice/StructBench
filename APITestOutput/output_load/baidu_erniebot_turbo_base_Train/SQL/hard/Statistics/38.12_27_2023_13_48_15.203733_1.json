The table contains information on the salary of each employee, but it does not provide information on the number of employees who earn a certain amount of salary.\n\nIf you want to know how many people earn more than a certain amount of salary, you will need to add a new column to the table that contains this information. You can do this by adding a new column called \"salary_group\" or \"earnings_group\" and then counting the number of rows in each group.\n\nIf you want to know how many people earn more than 864,116, you can add a new column called \"salary_group\" and then count the number of rows where salary is greater than or equal to 864,116. In this case, the resulting number will be 4 (as there are four rows with salary greater than or equal to 864,116).\n\nIf you want to know how many people earn more than a different amount (e.g., 864,117), you can adjust the threshold accordingly.\n\nOnce you have added the new column, you can use a programming language like Python or SQL to count the number of rows in each group and get the desired result."
