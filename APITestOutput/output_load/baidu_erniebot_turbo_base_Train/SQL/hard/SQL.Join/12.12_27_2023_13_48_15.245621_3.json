However, if you want to know how many people in HI are taller than 166, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE company = 'Meta' AND height > 166\n```\n\nThis query will return the number of employees who work for Meta and are taller than 166. If you want to know the total number of employees at Meta, you can add the following line to the query:\n\n```sql\nAND company = 'Meta'\n```\n\nBy replacing \"employees\" with the table name and adding additional conditions to the WHERE clause, you can get specific information about employees in HI who meet certain criteria. Please provide more details if you want more specific answers."
