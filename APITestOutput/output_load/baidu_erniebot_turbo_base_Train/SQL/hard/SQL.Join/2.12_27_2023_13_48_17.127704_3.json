        "According to the provided data, there are 9 people who work at CA and are taller than 173 cm. These people are:\n\na, c, e, g, h, i\n\nNote: \"e\" is a duplicate of \"e\" in the second table. We have included it here to maintain the answer accuracy.\n\nYou can use the following formula to calculate the answer:\n\n1) First find the total number of people who work at CA by adding up the \"company\" values for \"CA\" and the corresponding rows. In this case, that would be: 7 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 5 = 25\n\n2) Then subtract from that total the number of people who are not taller than 173 cm. In this case, that would be: 2 (b and j)\n\n3) Finally, divide the remaining number by 2 (the number of tables) to get the final answer. In this case, it would be: (9) / (2) = 4.5. However, you have to round up to the next integer since this is an exact answer question. Therefore, the answer is: 5 people who work at CA are taller than 173 cm."
