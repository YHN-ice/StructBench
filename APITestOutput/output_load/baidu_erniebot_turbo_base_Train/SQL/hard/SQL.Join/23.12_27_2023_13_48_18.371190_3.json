        "In order to answer your question, you would need to count the number of rows where the height is greater than 180, which would require scanning the entire table. The answer, in terms of count of rows, is not that simple as the height information is spread over two tables and in both the tables height values might be rounded. Therefore, you will need to create a script that combines both the tables and then calculate the count of rows where height is greater than 180.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\ndf_1 = pd.read_csv('people_height_table.csv')\ndf_2 = pd.read_csv('people_employment_table.csv')\n\n# Combine both dataframes\ndf = pd.merge(df_1, df_2, on='name')\n\n# Filter for rows where height is greater than 180\nfiltered_df = df[df['height'] > 180]\n\n# Count the number of rows\ncount = filtered_df.shape[0]\n\nprint(f'The number of people who work at Google and are taller than 180 is: {count}')\n```\nPlease note that this assumes that the height values in both tables are accurate and not rounded. If they are rounded, you might need to adjust the filtering criteria accordingly. Also, this assumes that the 'name' column is unique across both tables, which might not be the case if there are duplicates. If there are duplicates, you might need to adjust the merge step accordingly."
