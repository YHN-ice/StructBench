        "Based on the provided data, there are 10 people who work in TX and are taller than 166.\n\nThe data provided includes information on people's height, weight, gender, age, name, color, status (employed/unemployed/retired), salary, and company. Based on the height criteria, there are the following people who meet the requirement:\n\n* e: male, height 191 cm\n* h: female, height 154 cm\n* j: female, height 178 cm\n* i: male, height 135 cm (height 135 is not included in the original question but it's still a tall person)\n* f: male, height 182 cm (height 182 is not included in the original question but it's still a tall person)\n* a: female, height 124 cm (height 124 is not included in the original question but it's still a tall person)\n* b: male, height 183 cm\n* d: male, height 166 cm\n* g: female, height 178 cm (height 178 is not included in the original question but it's still a tall person)\n* k: male, height 188 cm\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10. Note that h is also listed as a retired person, but based on her age and company (Twitter), it seems reasonable to assume that she may be temporarily unemployed. Similarly for e, we also need to take into account the fact that he may be unemployed for now. Therefore, the total count may be slightly higher."
