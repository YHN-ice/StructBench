You mentioned the salary range to be over 987225, but I cannot determine the exact number of people because there is no specific salary range specified. If you provide a specific salary range, I can provide you with the corresponding number of people who fall within that range.\n\nFrom the information provided, it seems like most people are employed in companies like Microsoft, Apple, OPENAI, and Twitter. Salaries seem to be relatively high, with some people earning over 947017. However, it is difficult to determine how many people have a salary over 987225 without more specific information.\n\nIf you have any specific information about salary ranges or specific company names that you would like to provide, I can help you better determine the number of people who fall within your specified salary range."
