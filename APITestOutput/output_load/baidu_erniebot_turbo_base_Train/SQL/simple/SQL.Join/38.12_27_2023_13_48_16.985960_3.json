The height of person b is 190 cm, which is taller than 161 cm.\n2. The height of person d is 164 cm, which is taller than 161 cm.\n3. The height of person e is 176 cm, which is taller than 161 cm.\n4. The height of person f is 205 cm, which is taller than 161 cm.\n5. The height of person h is 163 cm, which is also taller than 161 cm.\n6. Person i has not provided a height in the table, but it is still counted as taller than 161 cm because we are considering the state of Texas as the reference point.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 people who work in Texas and are taller than 161 cm, accounting for a total of 72 people (3 columns in total). It's also important to note that although there are several missing rows (j and l) and white hair people in other parts of the table, these were not relevant to our specific question, so they were not included in the count."
