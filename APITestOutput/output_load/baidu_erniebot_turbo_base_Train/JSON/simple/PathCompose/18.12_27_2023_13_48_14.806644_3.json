You then access the first `subs` array within the `subs` array with `[0]`, and then access the final nested `X` key with `[\"X\"]`.\n\nPlease note that this assumes that there is only one level of nested arrays within the `subs` array. If there are multiple levels of nested arrays, you would need to adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nAlso, if \"x\" is not always present in the nested structure, you may need to handle the case where it is missing by checking for its existence before accessing it.\n\nFinally, this assumes that your JSON object is in a valid format and that it is properly loaded into a variable named `json_data`. If these assumptions are not true, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."
