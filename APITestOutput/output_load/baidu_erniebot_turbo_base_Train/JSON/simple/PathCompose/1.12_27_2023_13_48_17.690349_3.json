Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"n\",\n\"Z\":\"p\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"o\",\n \"Y\":\"o\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"p\",\n  \"X\":\"n\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "If you want to access the value of \"p\" through the JSON structure you provided, you can use a recursive function to navigate through the nested objects.

It iterates through the object's properties and checks if the current key is in the list of keys. If it is, it recursively navigates to the next level of the object using the remaining keys. If the object is a list and the current key is a dictionary, it checks if there are any remaining keys to navigate to. If there are none, it returns the value. Otherwise, it continues with the next item in the list. The `print` statement at the end demonstrates how to use this function to access the value \"p\"."
