        "To access the value \"e\" in the given JSON structure, you can follow the given path:\n\n\n```json\nobj[\"subs\"][1][\"subs\"][2][\"X\"]\n```\nHere's an explanation of the steps:\n\n1. `obj` refers to the outer-most object in the JSON structure.\n2. `\"subs\"` is a key within `obj` that represents an array of sub-objects.\n3. `[1]` is used to access the second (index 1) sub-object in the `subs` array.\n4. `\"subs\"` is again a key within the sub-object that represents an array of sub-sub-objects.\n5. `[2]` is used to access the third (index 2) sub-sub-object in the `subs` array.\n6. `\"X\"` is the key that refers to the value \"e\".\n\nSo, when you follow these steps, you will be able to access the value \"e\". You can also use a shorter notation for accessing deeper nested objects, like this:\n\n\n```json\nobj[\"subs\"][1][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"]\n```\nThis is because in JSON, you can use negative indices to access deeper nested objects. So, `[1][2]` becomes `[-2]` when you have a negative index. This notation is more concise and easier to read."
