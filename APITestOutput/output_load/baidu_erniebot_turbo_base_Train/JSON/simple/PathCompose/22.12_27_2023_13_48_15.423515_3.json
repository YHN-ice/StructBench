You can access nested objects and arrays by using their keys or indices. In this case, you can access the value \"c\" from the nested object \"subs\" of the object \"obj\".\n\nRemember that in Python, unlike some other programming languages, it is not necessary to specify an index for accessing an array or object. You can simply use its key or name to access it."
