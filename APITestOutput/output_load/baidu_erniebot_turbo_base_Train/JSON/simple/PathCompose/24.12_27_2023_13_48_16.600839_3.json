Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"u\",\n\"Z\":\"g\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"v\",\n \"Y\":\"f\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"w\",\n  \"X\":\"e\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "In this case, the value \"g\" is nested within multiple levels of nested objects. You can access it using the index notation similar to the following:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar obj = {\n  \"id\": \"u\",\n  \"Z\": \"g\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"v\",\n      \"Y\": \"f\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"w\",\n          \"X\": \"e\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\nvar value = obj.subs[0].subs[0].g; // Assuming g exists within these levels of objects\n```\nIn this example, we start with the root object `obj` and traverse through its nested properties to reach the desired value `g`. We use the index notation to access each nested level of objects. If `g` exists within the nested objects, the value will be assigned to the variable `value`.\n\nMake sure to adjust the index values based on the actual structure of your data. In this case, we are assuming that `g` exists within the first and second levels of nested objects. If it exists within a different level, you will need to adjust the index values accordingly."
