Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"e\",\n\"Z\":\"v\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"f\",\n \"Y\":\"u\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"g\",\n  \"X\":\"t\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "To access the value \"v\" in the given JSON object, you can follow the path specified in the question. The path is `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"id\"]` which would give you the value \"e\". Then, you can access the value \"v\" by using `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]` or `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"id\"]` based on your specific requirement.\n\nTo follow this path in Python, you can use the `get()` method in a loop, as shown below:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_str = \"\"\"\n{\n\"id\":\"e\",\n\"Z\":\"v\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"f\",\n \"Y\":\"u\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"g\",\n  \"X\":\"t\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nobj = json.loads(json_str)\nvalue = obj[\"subs\"][0][\"id\"]  # or obj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"] or obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"id\"] based on your requirement\nprint(value)  # prints \"e\"\n```\nIn this example, I assumed that you want to access the value \"v\" directly from the JSON object. If you want to access it from a different level, you can adjust the path accordingly. Please note that this assumes that the JSON object is valid and that the path exists. If it's not valid or if the path doesn't exist, you might get an error."
