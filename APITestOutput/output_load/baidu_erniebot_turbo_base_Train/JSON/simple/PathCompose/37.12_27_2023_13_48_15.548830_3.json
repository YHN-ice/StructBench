        "In your question, you mentioned accessing a value \"yy\" from an object with nested objects and arrays. To access the value \"yy\", you need to follow the path or reference to it using the keys or indexes.\n\nAssuming you have the input object you provided, you can access the value \"yy\" like this:\n\n\n```python\nobj = {\n    \"id\": \"a\",\n    \"Z\": \"a\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"b\",\n            \"Y\": \"zy\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"c\",\n                    \"X\": \"yy\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nvalue = obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][1][\"X\"]  # Accessing 'yy' value\nprint(value)  # Output: yy\n```\nHere, we are using a series of nested index/key references to get to the value \"yy\". We start with the outer array index 0, then the nested array index 1, and finally the key \"X\" to get to the value \"yy\". Please note that the indexes and keys may vary depending on your actual data structure. If you have multiple levels of nested objects and arrays, you need to follow the same pattern and keep going deeper until you reach the desired value."
