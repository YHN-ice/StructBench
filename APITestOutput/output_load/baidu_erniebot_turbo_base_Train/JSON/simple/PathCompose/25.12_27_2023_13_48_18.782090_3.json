The `subs` key corresponds to a list of nested objects, and we access the first nested object using `[0]`. Then, we access the last nested object in that object using `[-1]` to get the value \"r\".\n\nMake sure to adjust the code according to your actual input object and desired path to access the value \"r\"."
