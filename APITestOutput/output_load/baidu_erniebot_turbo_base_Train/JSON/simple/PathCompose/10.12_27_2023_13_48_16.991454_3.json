Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"k\",\n\"Z\":\"m\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"l\",\n \"Y\":\"l\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"m\",\n  \"X\":\"k\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "To access the value \"m\" in the given JSON object, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the root object, which is the given JSON object.\n2. Use the keys or indexes to access the nested objects within the root object.\n3. Once you reach the nested object where \"m\" is located, you can access its value \"m\".\n\nHere's an example Python code to achieve this:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Input JSON\njson_string = '''\n{\n  \"id\":\"k\",\n  \"Z\":\"m\",\n  \"subs\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"l\",\n      \"Y\":\"l\",\n      \"subs\":[\n        {\n          \"id\":\"m\",\n          \"X\":\"k\",\n          \"subs\":[]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n'''\n\n# Convert JSON string to Python dictionary\njson_data = json.loads(json_string)\n\n# Access value \"m\" using keys and indexes\nvalue_m = json_data[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"Z\"]\nprint(value_m)  # Output: m\n```\nIn this example, we start with the root object and access its \"subs\" property, which is an array of nested objects. We then access the first nested object within \"subs\", which has a property \"subs\" that is another array of nested objects. Finally, we access the property \"Z\" of the nested object at index 0 to get the value \"m\"."
