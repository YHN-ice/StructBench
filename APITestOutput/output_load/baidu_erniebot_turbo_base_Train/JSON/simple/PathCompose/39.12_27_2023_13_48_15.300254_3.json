Inside that object, find the array with \"subs\" key.\n3. Inside that array, find the object with \"id\" key equal to \"l\".\n4. Inside that object, you will find the value \"a\".\n\nIn Python, you can use the following code:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_str = \"\"\"\n{\n  \"id\":\"j\",\n  \"Z\":\"a\",\n  \"subs\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"k\",\n      \"Y\":\"zy\",\n      \"subs\":[\n        {\n          \"id\":\"l\",\n          \"X\":\"yy\",\n          \"subs\":[]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Convert JSON string to Python dictionary\njson_obj = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Find the object with \"id\" key equal to \"j\"\nobj = json_obj[\"subs\"][0]\n\n# Find the value \"a\" inside that object\nvalue = obj[\"Z\"]\nprint(value)  # Output: a\n```\nThis code will output \"a\". It will follow the exact structure you provided in the question and access the value \"a\". Note that this assumes that the JSON structure is always the same and that there are no missing keys or nested objects. If these assumptions are not true, you may need to adjust the code accordingly."
