Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"k\",\n\"Z\":\"b\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"l\",\n \"Y\":\"a\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"m\",\n  \"X\":\"zy\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "To access the value \"zy\" in the given JSON structure, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the root object `{...}`\n2. Find the key `\"subs\"` in the first level of the object\n3. Inside the `\"subs\"` array, find the second level object with `\"id\": \"m\"`\n4. Inside the second level object, you will find the key `\"X\"` which has the value `\"zy\"`\n\nSo, you can access the value \"zy\" using the following code:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_str = \"\"\"\n{\n  \"id\":\"k\",\n  \"Z\":\"b\",\n  \"subs\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"l\",\n      \"Y\":\"a\",\n      \"subs\":[\n        {\n          \"id\":\"m\",\n          \"X\":\"zy\",\n          \"subs\":[]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Convert JSON string to Python dictionary\ndata = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Access value \"zy\" using index 2 (steps 3 and 4)\nvalue = data[\"subs\"][1][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"]\nprint(value)  # Output: \"zy\"\n```\nIn this example, we assumed that there is only one `\"subs\"` array at the second level, but if there are multiple sub-arrays, you may need to access them accordingly using appropriate indices. Also, note that if you want to access other values, you can use the same steps to navigate through the JSON structure."
