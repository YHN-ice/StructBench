Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"w\",\n\"Z\":\"e\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"x\",\n \"Y\":\"d\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"y\",\n  \"X\":\"c\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "To access the value \"d\" in the given JSON object, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Find the \"subs\" array within the main object.\n2. Find the nested \"subs\" array within the \"subs\" array.\n3. Access the value \"d\" within that nested \"subs\" array.\n\nHere's an example Python code to do that:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_str = '''{\n\"id\":\"w\",\n\"Z\":\"e\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"x\",\n \"Y\":\"d\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"y\",\n  \"X\":\"c\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }]\n}'''\n\n# Convert JSON string to Python dictionary\njson_obj = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Find the nested \"subs\" array within the \"subs\" array\nnested_subs = json_obj['subs'][0]['subs']\n\n# Access the value \"d\" within the nested \"subs\" array\nvalue_d = nested_subs[0]['Y']\nprint(value_d)  # Output: d\n```\nIn this example, we assume that the JSON object is stored in a variable named `json_str`. The code first converts the JSON string to a Python dictionary using the `json.loads()` function. Then, it traverses the nested structure to find the value \"d\". Finally, it prints the value of \"d\".\n\nPlease note that this assumes that there will always be exactly one level of nesting in the JSON structure, which may not always be true in practice. If there can be more than one level of nesting, you would need a recursive approach to access values at different levels of nesting."
