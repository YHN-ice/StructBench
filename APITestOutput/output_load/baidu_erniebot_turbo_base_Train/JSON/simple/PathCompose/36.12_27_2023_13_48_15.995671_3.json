Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"h\",\n\"Z\":\"e\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"i\",\n \"Y\":\"d\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"j\",\n  \"X\":\"c\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",

The nested objects are accessed similarly, starting from the second level down. You can continue to access deeper nested objects by incrementing the index by 1 each time.\n\nMake sure to handle the case where the index doesn't exist or is out of bounds, as this could raise an error. You can use a try/except block to handle this situation."
