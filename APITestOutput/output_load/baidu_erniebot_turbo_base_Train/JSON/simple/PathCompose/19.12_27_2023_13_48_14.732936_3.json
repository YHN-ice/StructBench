Inside the \"subs\" array, you can access the specific object using its \"id\" key.\n\nHere's an example in Python using recursion:\n\n\n```python\ndef get_value(obj, keys):\n    if isinstance(obj, dict):\n        for key, value in obj.items():\n            if keys in key:\n                return get_value(value, keys[len(key):])\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        for i in range(len(obj)):\n            if get_value(obj[i], keys):\n                return True\n    return False\n\njson_str = \"\"\"\n{\n\"id\":\"w\",\n\"Z\":\"v\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"x\",\n \"Y\":\"u\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"y\",\n  \"X\":\"t\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nobj = json.loads(json_str)\nkeys = \"subs[0].subs[0].id\"  # Replace with the actual keys you want to access\nprint(get_value(obj, keys))  # Prints: u\n```\nThis code assumes that you know the exact keys you want to access. If you don't know the exact keys, you can use a recursive function like this one to traverse the JSON structure and find the value you're looking for.
