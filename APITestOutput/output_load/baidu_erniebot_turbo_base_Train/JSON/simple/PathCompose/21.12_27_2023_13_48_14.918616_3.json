        "Question: How to access value \"n\"? Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"c\",\n\"Z\":\"o\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"d\",\n \"Y\":\"n\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"e\",\n  \"X\":\"m\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "In this case, the value \"n\" is nested within multiple levels of nested objects and arrays. To access this value, you need to follow the specified path using the keys or indexes.\n\nHere's how you can access the value \"n\":\n\n\n```python\nobj = {\n    \"id\": \"c\",\n    \"Z\": \"o\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"d\",\n            \"Y\": \"n\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"e\",\n                    \"X\": \"m\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n# Accessing \"n\" using keys\nvalue = obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][1][\"Y\"]\nprint(value)  # Output: n\n```\nIn this example, we first access the outer-most level using `obj[\"subs\"][0]`. Then, we access the next level using `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][1]`. Finally, we access the value \"n\" using `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][1][\"Y\"]`.\n\nYou can also use indexes to access values within arrays. In this case, you would use an integer index to access the desired element. For example:\n\n\n```python\n# Accessing \"n\" using indexes\nvalue = obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]  # Assuming there is only one element in each sub-array\nprint(value)  # Output: n\n```\nIn this case, we access the value \"n\" using the index 0 for the first sub-array and index 0 for the desired element within that array. Please note that this assumes there is only one element in each sub-array. If there are multiple elements, you would need to adjust the index accordingly."
