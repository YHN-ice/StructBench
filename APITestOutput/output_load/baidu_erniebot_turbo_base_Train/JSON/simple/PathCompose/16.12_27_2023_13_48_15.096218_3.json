Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"v\",\n\"Z\":\"k\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"w\",\n \"Y\":\"j\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"x\",\n  \"X\":\"i\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "The structure of the input object seems to be nested. To access the value \"k\", you can use the following code:\n\n\n```python\ninput_obj = {\n    \"id\": \"v\",\n    \"Z\": \"k\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"w\",\n            \"Y\": \"j\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"x\",\n                    \"X\": \"i\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nvalue = input_obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"Z\"]  # This will access the value \"k\"\nprint(value)\n```\nIn this code, we start by accessing the \"subs\" list of the main object. Then, we access the first sublist using [0] index, and finally, we access the value \"Z\" using the appropriate keys. The output will be \"k\".\n\nMake sure to replace the code with the actual structure of your input object. If you have more nested structures, you will need to adjust the index accordingly."
