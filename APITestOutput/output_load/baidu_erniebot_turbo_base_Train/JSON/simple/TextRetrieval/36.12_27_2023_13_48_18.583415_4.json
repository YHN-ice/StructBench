        "The JSON object you provided contains nested objects to the maximum depth, but there is no list or dictionary within it. It only contains a single object with a few sub-objects within it. The nested structure looks like this:\n\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\": \"k\",\n    \"Z\": \"b\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"l\",\n            \"Y\": \"a\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"m\",\n                    \"X\": \"zy\",\n                    \"subs\": {}  // No list or dict here\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe most deeply nested object is \"subs[2]\", which is an empty dictionary.\n\nIf you want to find all objects that are not of type list or dict, you can use a recursive function that traverses the JSON structure and checks each object's type.

If you want to perform other operations on these objects, you can modify the `print` statement accordingly."
