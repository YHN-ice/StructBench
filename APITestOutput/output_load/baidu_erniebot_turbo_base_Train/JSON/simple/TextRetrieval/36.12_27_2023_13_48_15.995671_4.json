        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it does not contain any lists or dictionaries as values. It contains only nested objects, which are represented by \"subs\" keys. The structure of this object is as follows:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"h\",\n  \"Z\": \"e\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"i\",\n      \"Y\": \"d\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"j\",\n          \"X\": \"c\",\n          \"subs\": []  // This is the deepest nested object\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to extract the deepest nested object from this structure, you can use a recursive function in Python. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\ndef extract_deepest_nested_object(json_obj):\n    if isinstance(json_obj, dict):\n        if 'subs' in json_obj and isinstance(json_obj['subs'], list):\n            return extract_deepest_nested_object(json_obj['subs'][0]) if len(json_obj['subs']) > 0 else None\n        elif 'id' in json_obj and json_obj['id'] == 'j':  # if the current object is the deepest nested object\n            return json_obj\n    return None\n```\nTo use this function, you can simply pass your JSON object to it like this: `extract_deepest_nested_object(your_json_object)` and it will return the deepest nested object. If there are no nested objects at all, it will return None.\n\nNote: This assumes that the JSON object you're working with is always a valid JSON object, and that it always contains a single deepest nested object. If those assumptions are not true, you may need to adjust the function accordingly."
