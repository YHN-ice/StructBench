        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it doesn't contain any list or dict values at the deepest level. The deepest level object is \"subs\" in the \"id\" key, which is an empty dictionary. Here's an excerpt of the JSON content as it appears in the file, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"o\",\n  \"Z\": \"n\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"p\",\n      \"Y\": \"m\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"q\",\n          \"X\": \"l\",\n          \"subs\": {}  // <-- The deepest level object\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to find all objects that are not list or dict at any level, you can use a recursive function to traverse the JSON object and check its type. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_non_list_dict_objects(obj):\n    if isinstance(obj, list):\n        for item in obj:\n            if not isinstance(item, dict):\n                yield item\n        return\n    elif isinstance(obj, dict):\n        for key, value in obj.items():\n            for result in find_non_list_dict_objects(value):\n                yield result\n    else:\n        yield obj\n\nwith open('your_file.json', 'r') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n    for obj in find_non_list_dict_objects(data):\n        print(obj)\n```\nThis code will find all non-list and non-dict objects in the JSON file and print them out. Please replace `'your_file.json'` with the actual name of your JSON file."
