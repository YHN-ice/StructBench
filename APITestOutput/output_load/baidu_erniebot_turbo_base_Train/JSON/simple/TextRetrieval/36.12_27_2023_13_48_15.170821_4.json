        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it does not contain any lists or dictionaries as values. It contains only nested objects, with each object having an \"id\" and \"subs\" attribute. The \"subs\" attribute itself can also be nested, but it always contains other objects with the same structure.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"k\",\n  \"Z\": \"u\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"l\",\n      \"Y\": \"t\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"m\",\n          \"X\": \"s\",\n          \"subs\": {  <-- Here's an example of a deeply nested object\n            \"id\": \"n\",\n            \"subs\": []\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to extract the deepest nested objects, you can use a recursive function in your programming language of choice. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\ndef extract_deepest_nested_objects(json_obj):\n    def extract_nested_objects(obj):\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            for key, value in obj.items():\n                if isinstance(value, dict) or isinstance(value, list):\n                    yield from extract_nested_objects(value)\n                elif isinstance(value, dict) and value[\"subs\"] is not None:  # Make sure 'subs' attribute is not None for objects that might have a value of None initially.\n                    yield value\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):\n            for value in obj:\n                yield from extract_nested_objects(value)\n\n    return list(extract_nested_objects(json_obj))\n```\nCall this function with your JSON object as input and it will return a list of all the deepest nested objects. Note that this function will also include objects that are not at the deepest level, but have \"subs\" attributes that contain other objects."
