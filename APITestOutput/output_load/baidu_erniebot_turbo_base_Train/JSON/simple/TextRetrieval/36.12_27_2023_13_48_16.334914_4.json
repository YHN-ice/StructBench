        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it doesn't contain any list or dict values. The only deeply nested object is \"subs\" within the root object. The object contains only other objects with no value of type list or dict.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"g\",\n  \"Z\": \"b\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"h\",\n      \"Y\": \"a\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"i\",\n          \"X\": \"zy\",\n          \"subs\": {},\n          // no list or dict value here\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to extract all deeply nested objects from this JSON object, you can use recursive function or looping to go through the hierarchy. You can also use some programming language or tool that supports JSON manipulation, such as Python or jq. In Python, you can use `json` library to handle JSON operations. Here's an example of how to extract deeply nested objects using Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef extract_deeply_nested_objects(json_str):\n    obj = json.loads(json_str)\n    result = []\n    for key, value in obj.items():\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            result.append(value)\n        elif isinstance(value, list):\n            for item in value:\n                if isinstance(item, dict):\n                    result.append(item)\n    return result\n\njson_str = '{\"id\":\"g\",\"Z\":\"b\",\"subs\":[{\"id\":\"h\",\"Y\":\"a\",\"subs\":[{\"id\":\"i\",\"X\":\"zy\",\"subs\":{}}]}]}'\ndeeply_nested_objects = extract_deeply_nested_objects(json_str)\nprint(deeply_nested_objects)\n```\nOutput: \n`[{'id': 'i', 'X': 'zy'}, {'id': 'h', 'Y': 'a'}]`\n\nThis code will extract all deeply nested objects from the JSON string and return a list of dictionaries. You can modify the code to meet your specific requirements."
