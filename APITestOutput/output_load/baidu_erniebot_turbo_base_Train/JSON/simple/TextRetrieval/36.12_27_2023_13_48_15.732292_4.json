        "Question: What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?The content should be an excerpt as they appear in the JSON file, separated by \\n\\n.\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"v\",\n\"Z\":\"e\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"w\",\n \"Y\":\"d\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"x\",\n  \"X\":\"c\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "Based on the JSON input you provided, the most deeply nested object is \"subs\" of the \"Z\" object. It is an array of objects, where each object has \"subs\" as its key, which is also an array of objects. There is no list or dict type within this object.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content as it appears in the file, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"v\",\n  \"Z\": \"e\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"w\",\n      \"Y\": \"d\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"x\",\n          \"X\": \"c\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to extract this nested structure, you can use a recursive function or a recursive JSON parsing library like `jsonpath`. Here's an example using `jsonpath`:\n\n\n```python\nimport jsonpath\n\njson_str = \"\"\"\n{\n  \"id\": \"v\",\n  \"Z\": \"e\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"w\",\n      \"Y\": \"d\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"x\",\n          \"X\": \"c\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\"\"\"\nobj = jsonpath.parse(json_str).find('$.subs[*].subs')\nfor path in obj:\n    print(path.value)\n```\nThis code will print out all the nested objects in the JSON string. You can modify it to fit your specific needs."
