        "Your JSON structure appears to be deeply nested but there is no list or dict value with an infinite depth. The \"subs\" key appears to be a recursive structure where each item has a \"subs\" key that can contain other items with the same structure. However, the maximum depth seems to be limited by the nesting of the root object.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content you provided, separated by \\n\\n for readability:\n\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\":\"q\",\n    \"Z\":\"q\",\n    \"subs\":[\n        {\n            \"id\":\"r\",\n            \"Y\":\"p\",\n            \"subs\":[\n                {\n                    \"id\":\"s\",\n                    \"X\":\"o\",\n                    \"subs\":[ ... ] // Nested even further\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe deepest \"subs\" item here is a dict with only one key-value pair, \"X\":\"o\". It doesn't have a list or dict as its value, but it still has a recursive \"subs\" key. This suggests that there's no upper limit to the depth of this structure.\n\nIf you have a JSON structure that is infinitely nested (i.e., there's no maximum depth), then it's a bad practice to have such a structure because it can lead to memory issues and other problems when processing the data. It's better to structure your data in a way that limits the depth of nesting to avoid these issues. If you have such a requirement, you may want to consider refactoring your data model or use a tool that limits the depth of nesting."
