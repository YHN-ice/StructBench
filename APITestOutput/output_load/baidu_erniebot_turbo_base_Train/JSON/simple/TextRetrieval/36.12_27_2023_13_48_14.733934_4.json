        "Question: What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?The content should be an excerpt as they appear in the JSON file, separated by \\n\\n.\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"w\",\n\"Z\":\"v\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"x\",\n \"Y\":\"u\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"y\",\n  \"X\":\"t\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it doesn't contain any list or dict values that are deeper than the current level. The object contains a single top-level value (\"subs\"), which itself is a nested list with a single entry, which is a nested object with another nested \"subs\" property that is empty.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"w\",\n  \"Z\": \"v\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"x\",\n      \"Y\": \"u\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"y\",\n          \"X\": \"t\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to find the deepest nested object that is not a list or dict, you can use a recursive function in Python that traverses the object and keeps track of the deepest nested level. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_deepest_object(obj):\n    if isinstance(obj, dict):\n        if not obj:\n            return None  # return None if the object is empty\n        deepest = max(obj.items(), key=lambda x: x[1].get('subs')) if 'subs' in x[1] else None\n        if deepest is not None:\n            return deepest[0]  # return the deepest object as a key, which is a dictionary or nested object\n        else:\n            return find_deepest_object(obj.get('subs'))  # if there's no 'subs' property, recursively search the sub-objects\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        return None  # if the object is a list, return None as it's not a deeply nested object\n    else:\n        return obj  # if the object is not a dictionary or list, return it as it's not deeply nested\n```\nYou can use this function to find the deepest nested object in your JSON object, but make sure to replace it with your actual JSON data before using it. You can also modify it to suit your specific needs by adding additional conditions or modifying the logic."
