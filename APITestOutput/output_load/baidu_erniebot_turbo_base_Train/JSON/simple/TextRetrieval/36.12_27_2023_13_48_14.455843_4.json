The value of this nested JSON object is also a JSON string, which contains another key-value pair.\n\nIf you want to extract all deeply nested objects like this, you can use a recursive function or a recursive JSON parser to parse the JSON and extract all deeply nested objects. However, it's important to note that JSON is designed to represent data structures, not recursive data structures, so it's not always possible to represent all possible recursive data structures in JSON. In this case, the nested structure you provided is relatively simple and can be represented in JSON. However, if you have more complex recursive data structures, it may be more difficult to represent them in JSON."
