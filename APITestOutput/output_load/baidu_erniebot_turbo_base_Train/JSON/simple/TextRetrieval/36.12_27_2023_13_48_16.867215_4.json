        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it doesn't contain any list or dict values at the deepest level. The deepest object has only a \"subs\" property, which is an empty dictionary.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content as it appears in the file, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"z\",\n  \"Z\": \"g\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"ab\",\n      \"Y\": \"f\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"bb\",\n          \"X\": \"e\",\n          \"subs\": {}  <- deepest level\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to find the deepest nested object that doesn't contain a list or dict value, you can use a recursive function to traverse the JSON object and check each level.

If there are no such objects in the JSON object, it will return `None` for both `obj` and `key`."
