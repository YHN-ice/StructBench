        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it doesn't contain any list or dict values that are deeper than the current level. The object contains only nested dictionaries.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content as it appears in the file, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"p\",\n  \"Z\": \"f\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"q\",\n      \"Y\": \"e\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"r\",\n          \"X\": \"d\",\n          \"subs\": {\n            // No list or dict values deeper than this level\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to find the deepest nested object that doesn't contain any list or dict values deeper than the current level, you can use a recursive function in Python. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_deepest_object(data):\n    if isinstance(data, dict):\n        if not any(isinstance(v, (list, dict)) for v in data.values()):\n            return data\n        for key, value in data.items():\n            result = find_deepest_object(value)\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n    if isinstance(data, list):\n        for item in data:\n            result = find_deepest_object(item)\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n    return None\n```\nYou can use this function by passing your JSON data as a parameter and it will return the deepest nested object that doesn't contain any list or dict values deeper than the current level. If no such object is found, it will return None.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the JSON data is well-formed and valid. If your JSON data contains invalid structures or missing values, the function may not work as expected."
