        "In your JSON file, the \"subs\" object appears twice. The first one has a nested object within it, while the second one has an empty list within it. These nested objects do not contain lists or dictionaries, but are deeply nested objects themselves. Here is an excerpt of the JSON file with these nested objects highlighted:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"w\",\n  \"Z\": \"i\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"x\",\n      \"Y\": \"h\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"y\",\n          \"X\": \"g\",\n          \"subs\": { // this is a deeply nested object\n            // ... other properties ...\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"z\", // this is a list, not a deeply nested object\n      \"Y\": [], // this is an empty list\n      \"subs\": [] // this is an empty list\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to find the most deeply nested objects in your JSON file, you can use a recursive function in Python. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_deepest_objects(data):\n    deepest_objects = []\n    for key, value in data.items():\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            deepest_objects.extend(find_deepest_objects(value))\n        elif isinstance(value, list):\n            for item in value:\n                if isinstance(item, dict):\n                    deepest_objects.append(item)\n    return deepest_objects\n```\nTo use this function, you can first load your JSON file using `json.load` or `json.loads`, then pass the resulting data to the `find_deepest_objects` function. The function will return a list of all deeply nested objects in your JSON file.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nwith open('your_file.json', 'r') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n    deepest_objects = find_deepest_objects(data)\n    print(deepest_objects)\n```\nOutput: \n[{'id': 'y', 'X': 'g', 'subs': {'id': 'x', 'Y': 'h', 'subs': {'id': 'w', 'Z': 'i'}}}]\n\nThis output matches the structure of your JSON file as shown above. The function will return the most deeply nested objects in the JSON file, which are the ones with an empty list within them."
