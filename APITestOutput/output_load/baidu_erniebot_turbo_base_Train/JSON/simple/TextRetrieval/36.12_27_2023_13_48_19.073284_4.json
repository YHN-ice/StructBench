        "Question: What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?The content should be an excerpt as they appear in the JSON file, separated by \\n\\n.\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"r\",\n\"Z\":\"d\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"s\",\n \"Y\":\"c\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"t\",\n  \"X\":\"b\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "In your JSON file, the deepest nested object is the one with \"subs\" as its key, which is an empty list. This object is not a list or a dictionary, but a nested object with no values.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON file as you requested:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"r\",\n  \"Z\": \"d\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s\",\n      \"Y\": \"c\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"t\",\n          \"X\": \"b\",\n          \"subs\": []  // deepest nested object\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to extract all the nested objects like this, you can use a recursive function to traverse the JSON structure and find all the nested objects.
