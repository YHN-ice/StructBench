        "Question: What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?The content should be an excerpt as they appear in the JSON file, separated by \\n\\n.\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"l\",\n\"Z\":\"y\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"m\",\n \"Y\":\"x\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"n\",\n  \"X\":\"w\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "In your JSON structure, the deepest nested object is \"subs\" of the main object, which is an array of another object, and that object's \"subs\" property is also an empty array. This is the most deeply nested object in your JSON.\n\nHere's an excerpt of your JSON file, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"l\",\n  \"Z\": \"y\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"m\",\n      \"Y\": \"x\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"n\",\n          \"X\": \"w\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to know which object is the most deeply nested, you can use a recursive function in Python that iterates through the object and counts the number of nested levels. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_deepest_object(obj):\n    if isinstance(obj, list):\n        for item in obj:\n            deepest = find_deepest_object(item)\n            if deepest != -1:\n                return deepest\n    elif isinstance(obj, dict):\n        return -1  # Return -1 for non-nested objects like dict or list\n    return obj._root_ and obj.count(None) or len(obj._serialized) and 0 or 1  # root indicates top-level, serialized is an array of all nested items after going through conversion\n```\nJust run this function on your JSON data and it will return the deepest nested object. If there are no nested objects, it will return -1. If there are multiple nested objects with the same depth, it will return the first one encountered."
