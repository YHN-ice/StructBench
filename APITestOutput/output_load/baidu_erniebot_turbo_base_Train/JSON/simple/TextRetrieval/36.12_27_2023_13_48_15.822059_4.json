        "The most deeply nested object you have provided is the object inside the \"subs\" property of the main object. This object itself has no value of type list or dict, but it contains a nested object with a \"subs\" property that is also deeply nested.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content as you have provided, separated by \\n\\n for readability:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"i\",\n  \"Z\": \"i\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"j\",\n      \"Y\": \"h\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"k\",\n          \"X\": \"g\",\n          \"subs\": []  // This is the most deeply nested object\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to know what are the other possible deeply nested objects in a JSON file, you can use a recursive function to traverse through the entire structure and identify any objects that are not of type list or dict. However, this would require you to have access to the entire JSON file, which might not always be possible. If you have access to the entire file, you can use a recursive function like this:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_non_list_dict_objects(json_content):\n    for key, value in json_content.items():\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            for sub_key, sub_value in value.items():\n                if not isinstance(sub_value, (list, dict)):\n                    yield sub_key, sub_value\n        elif isinstance(value, list):\n            for item in value:\n                if not isinstance(item, (list, dict)):\n                    yield key, item\n```\nThis function will traverse through the entire JSON content and yield any non-list or non-dict objects it encounters. You can then use this function to find out what other deeply nested objects might exist in your JSON file. However, keep in mind that this will only work if you have access to the entire JSON file. If you only have a portion of the file, you might need to manually identify these objects using a text editor or other tools."
