        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it does not contain any lists or dictionaries as values. It contains only nested objects, which are represented as \"subs\". The object you provided is a single object with three levels of nesting.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON file, separated by \\n\\n for readability:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"q\",\n  \"Z\": \"q\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"r\",\n      \"Y\": \"p\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"s\",\n          \"X\": \"o\",\n          \"subs\": []  // No value of type list or dict here\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to traverse this deeply nested structure and extract certain values, you can use a recursive function in Python. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\ndef extract_values(obj, keys):\n    if isinstance(obj, dict):\n        for key, value in obj.items():\n            if key in keys:\n                yield value\n            else:\n                for result in extract_values(value, keys + [key]):\n                    yield result\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        for value in obj:\n            for result in extract_values(value, keys):\n                yield result\n    else:\n        yield obj\n\n# Test the function with your JSON data\nfor value in extract_values(json_data, []):\n    print(value)\n```\nIn this function, `json_data` is the name of your JSON file and `keys` is the list of keys you want to extract. You can modify this according to your needs. This function will recursively traverse the JSON structure and yield any matching values. You can use this as a starting point to extract specific values from the deeply nested structure."
