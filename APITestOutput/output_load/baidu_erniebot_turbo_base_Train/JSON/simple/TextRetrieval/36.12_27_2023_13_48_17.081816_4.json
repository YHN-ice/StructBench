        "Question: What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?The content should be an excerpt as they appear in the JSON file, separated by \\n\\n.\n\nInput: \n{\n\"id\":\"u\",\n\"Z\":\"l\",\n\"subs\":[\n {\n \"id\":\"v\",\n \"Y\":\"k\",\n \"subs\":[\n  {\n  \"id\":\"w\",\n  \"X\":\"j\",\n  \"subs\":[]\n  }\n ]\n }\n]\n}\n\n\n",
        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it doesn't contain any list or dict values that are deeper than the current level. The object contains a single top-level key, \"subs\", which itself contains a list of objects, each of which has a single key, \"subs\", which also contains an object without any deeper list or dict values.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"u\",\n  \"Z\": \"l\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"v\",\n      \"Y\": \"k\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"w\",\n          \"X\": \"j\",\n          \"subs\": {}  <- notice there's no deeper list or dict here\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to find the deepest nested object that doesn't contain any list or dict values, you can use a recursive function in Python. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_deepest_object(obj):\n    if isinstance(obj, dict):\n        for key, value in obj.items():\n            if isinstance(value, (list, dict)):\n                result = find_deepest_object(value)\n                if result is not None:\n                    return result\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        for item in obj:\n            result = find_deepest_object(item)\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n    return None  # return None if it's not a list or dict\n```\nYou can call this function with your JSON object as input and it will return the deepest nested object that doesn't contain any list or dict values. If there's no such object, it will return None.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the JSON is well-formed and doesn't contain any invalid values. If your JSON may contain invalid values, you may need to add additional checks to handle those cases."
