        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it does not contain any lists or dictionaries as values. It contains only nested objects, with each level having a different key. The maximum depth of nesting seems to be at the third level, where there is an object with no children.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content as it appears in the file, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"d\",\n  \"Z\": \"z\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"e\",\n      \"Y\": \"y\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"f\",\n          \"X\": \"x\",\n          \"subs\": {  <- Here's the most deeply nested object\n            \"id\": \"\",\n            \"X\": \"\",\n            \"subs\": []\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to extract all the deeply nested objects from this JSON file, you can use a recursive function in Python. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\ndef extract_nested_objects(json_content):\n    nested_objects = []\n    for key, value in json_content.items():\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            for subkey, subvalue in value.items():\n                if isinstance(subvalue, dict) and subvalue != {}:\n                    nested_objects.append(subvalue)\n        elif isinstance(value, list):\n            for item in value:\n                if isinstance(item, dict) and item != {}:\n                    nested_objects.append(item)\n    return nested_objects\n```\nYou can then use this function to extract all the deeply nested objects from your JSON file, and you'll get an output similar to this:\n\n\n```python\njson_file = \"\"\"{...the content of your JSON file...}\"\"\"  # replace with your actual JSON content\nnested_objects = extract_nested_objects(json_file)\nprint(nested_objects)\n```\nOutput:\n\n\n```lua\n[{'id': '', 'X': '', 'subs': {}}, ...]  # This is just an example output, you'll get the actual objects you're looking for.\n```"
