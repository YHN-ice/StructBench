        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it does not contain any lists or dictionaries as values. It only contains nested objects, each of which has its own set of attributes.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content, separated by \\n\\n for readability:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"j\",\n  \"Z\": \"x\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"k\",\n      \"Y\": \"w\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"l\",\n          \"X\": \"v\",\n          \"subs\": {  <-- Here's the deeply nested object\n            \"id\": \"\",\n            \"value\": \"\",\n            \"some_attribute\": \"\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe only way to get even deeper nesting would be to create a new object within the existing object, but that would create a new level of nesting within the existing object. It would not create a new list or dictionary as a value.\n\nIf you need to traverse this deeply nested structure, you may want to consider using a recursive function or method to handle it. You can use Python's built-in `json` module to parse and traverse this structure. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef traverse_json(json_str):\n    data = json.loads(json_str)\n    for item in data['subs']:\n        print(traverse_json(item))  # Recursively traverse the sub-objects\n        print(\"\\n\")  # Add a newline after each item for readability\n\n# Use the function with your JSON content as input\ntraverse_json(your_json_content)\n```\nThis will recursively traverse the deeply nested structure and print out the contents of each item in the `subs` array. You can modify the function as needed to suit your specific requirements."
