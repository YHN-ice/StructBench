        "The JSON object you provided is deeply nested, but it doesn't contain any list or dict values that are deeper than the current level. The only deeply nested object is the \"subs\" property of the root object, which contains another JSON object with no deeper nesting.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the JSON content as it appears in the file, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"m\",\n  \"Z\": \"s\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"n\",\n      \"Y\": \"r\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"o\",\n          \"X\": \"q\",\n          \"subs\": {}  <- this is the only deeply nested object\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nIf you want to find the deepest nested object in a JSON file, you can use a recursive function that traverses the object and keeps track of the deepest level. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_deepest_object(obj):\n    deepest = obj\n    for key, value in obj.items():\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            deepest = max(deepest, find_deepest_object(value))\n        elif isinstance(value, list):\n            for item in value:\n                if isinstance(item, dict):\n                    deepest = max(deepest, find_deepest_object(item))\n    return deepest\n```\nYou can call this function with your JSON object as input and it will return the deepest nested object. In this case, it would return the same object you provided above."
