You can access it using a JSON path or a programming language's JSON library. For example, in Python, you can use the json library to access it:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_string = \"\"\"...\"\"\"  # Your JSON string here\ndata = json.loads(json_string)\nfirst_sub_id = data['subs'][0]['id']\n```\nPlease provide more context if you need help with specific code or operations."
