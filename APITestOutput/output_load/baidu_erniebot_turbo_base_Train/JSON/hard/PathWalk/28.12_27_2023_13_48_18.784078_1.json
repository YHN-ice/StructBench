The \"subs\" array contains other objects, each of which also have an \"id\" property.\n\nSo, if you want to access the first object's id of the \"subs\" array in this specific structure, you can simply reference it using the variable or key \"w\".\n\nFor example, if you wanted to access the first object's id of the nested \"subs\" array, you would use:\n\n```json\n\"w\": \"your_desired_value\"\n```\n\nwhere \"your_desired_value\" is the value you want to assign to the id.\n\nIf you want to access all nested \"subs\" objects within the \"subs\" array, you would need to iterate through each object in the array using a loop or recursion. You can do this by using a recursive function or by iterating through each object in a loop.\n\nFor example, using a recursive function, you could write something like this:\n\n\n```python\ndef access_nested_object(object, index=None):\n    if index is None:\n        index = 0\n    if isinstance(object, dict):\n        for key, value in object.items():\n            if isinstance(value, list):\n                for sub_object in value:\n                    if isinstance(sub_object, dict):\n                        print(f\"Found nested object with id: {key}\")\n                        recursive_call = access_nested_object(sub_object)\n                        if recursive_call:\n                            print(f\"Recursively calling with index: {recursive_call}\")\n            elif isinstance(value, dict):\n                print(f\"Found nested object with id: {key}\")\n```\nYou would need to call this function with the root object as the first argument and an index of 0 if you want to start at the first nested object. If you want to start at a different index, you can pass that as a second argument.\n\nNote: This assumes that your JSON structure is always the same and that you always want to start at the first nested object. If your structure may change or you want to start at a different index, you may need to adjust this function accordingly."
