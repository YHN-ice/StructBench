The \"subs\" property of each object contains another object, which in turn may have a \"subs\" property that is also a list.\n\nThe structure you provided is a nested JSON structure, where each object represents a different entity or object. The first object in the list has id \"j\", and its \"subs\" property contains a list of other objects. Each of these sub-objects also has its own \"subs\" property, which may contain other objects, and so on.\n\nIf you want to access the first object's id, you can use a JSONPath expression or some other method to navigate through the structure and retrieve the value. Here's an example using JSONPath:\n\n\n```json\n$..[0].id\n```\nThis expression will return the value of the \"id\" property of the first object in the list. In this case, it will return \"j\".\n\nNote that JSONPath is a query language for selecting data from JSON documents. It allows you to navigate through the structure and retrieve specific values using an easy-to-understand syntax. You can find more information about JSONPath at its official website."
