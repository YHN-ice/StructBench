        "To access the value of \"b\", you can use a recursive method similar to what you'd use to traverse a nested dictionary.\n\nHere's an example Python function that does the job:\n\n\n```python\ndef access_value(obj, key_path):\n    if isinstance(obj, dict):\n        for key, value in obj.items():\n            if key in key_path:\n                return value\n            elif isinstance(value, dict) or isinstance(value, list):\n                return access_value(value, key_path + [key])\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        for item in obj:\n            if isinstance(item, dict) or isinstance(item, list):\n                return access_value(item, key_path)\n    return None\n```\nTo use this function, you can provide the object (in your case, it's a nested dictionary), and the key path (the list of keys you want to access). For example:\n\n\n```python\nvalue = access_value(your_dict, [\"subs\", 0, \"subs\", 1, \"id\"])\nprint(value)  # Outputs: \"g\"\n```\nIn this case, you're trying to access the value at \"subs\" -> 0 -> \"subs\" -> 1 -> \"id\", which is \"g\". The output should match the value you're trying to access. If there's no value at the given path, it will return None.\n\nYou can adjust the code as needed for your specific case. It assumes that your nested structures are always dictionaries or lists. If they're not, you might need to modify the function accordingly."
