        "Your input JSON structure contains a nested array structure where each inner object contains an `id`, `subs` array, and other properties.

Inside the loop, you need to iterate through the `subs` array of each inner object in the current `subs` array.\n3. You can use a variable such as `index` to keep track of the current position in the `subs` array.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Python using the json library:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_data = \"\"\"...\"\"\"  # Your JSON data as a string\ndata = json.loads(json_data)\n\nfor obj in data:\n    for sub_obj in obj[\"subs\"]:\n        for sub_sub_obj in sub_obj[\"subs\"]:\n            id = sub_sub_obj[\"id\"]\n            if id == \"j\":\n                print(sub_sub_obj)\n```\nOutput:\n\n\n```diff\n{id: 'j', N: 'j', M: 'i', subs: [{'id': 'k', L: 'h', K: 'g', subs: []}, {'id': 'l', J: 'f', subs: []}]}\n```\nThis code iterates through all the objects in the `subs` array and checks if the `id` is `j`. If it is, it prints the object with the details of `j`.\n\nNote that this code assumes that there is only one occurrence of `j` in the nested array.
