Currently, you have `:id` which is incorrect.\n2. You have used `id: d,` and `R: c,` as part of the YAML document structure. This is incorrect, as a list of key-value pairs must start with a mapping or sequence of values (like an object or array), not keys.\n3. In some cases, the value of `subs` should be an empty list instead of a mapping, like in `- id: \"j\"` and `- id: \"o\"`.\n4. It seems like there might be an error with your sequence delimiters as you are missing the closing `}` at the end of your file.\n\nTo fix these issues, please check and update your YAML file as follows:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"d\"\nZ: k,\nY: j,\nsubs: \n- id: \"e\"\n  X: i\n  subs: \n  - id: \"f\"\n    W: h\n    V: g\n    subs: \n    - id: \"g\"\n      U: f []\n    - id: \"h\"\n      T: e []\n  subs: [] :p\n- id: \"i\"\n  S: d\n  R: c\n  subs: \n  - id: \"j\"\n    Q: b []\n    P: a []\n  subs: [] :s\n- id: \"k\"\n  O: zy []\n  N: yy []\n  subs: [] :t\nsubs: [] :u\n- id: \"l\"\n  M: xy []\n  subs: \n  - id: \"m\"\n    L: wy []\n    K: vy []\n  subs: \n  - id: \"n\"\n    J: uy []\n    I: ty []\nsubs: [] :w\n- id: \"p\"\n  G: ry []\n  F: qy []\n  subs: \n  - id: \"q\"\n    E: py []\nsubs: [] :y\n```\nPlease make sure to update these issues and your YAML file should be in order now."
