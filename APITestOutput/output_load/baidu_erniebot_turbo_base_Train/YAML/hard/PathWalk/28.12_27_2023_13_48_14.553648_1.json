If you want to find the first object's id of a list of objects, you can use the following code:\n\n\n```python\nfirst_object_id = None\nfor sub in subs:\n    first_object_id = sub.id if sub.id is not None else first_object_id\n\nprint(first_object_id)\n```\nThis code will iterate through the list of objects (subs) and check each object's id attribute. If the id attribute is not None, it will assign it to the variable first_object_id. If not, it will use the value of first_object_id from the previous iteration (if any).\n\nIf you want to find the first object's id of a specific type of object (e.g., \"id\" starts with \"sub\"), you can modify the code accordingly.\n\nPlease provide more details if you need help with this or any other question related to your code."
