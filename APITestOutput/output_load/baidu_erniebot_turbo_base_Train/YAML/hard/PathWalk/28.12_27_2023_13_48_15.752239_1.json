Based on the provided input, the first object's id is \"x\".\n\nThe \"subs\" section is a list of sub-objects. The first sub-object is another list, where the first element has id \"y\". The next sub-object has id \"z\", and so on.\n\nSo, if you want to find the first object's id in the \"subs\" section, you should start from the first object in the \"subs\" section and follow the ids in the list until you find the first one that doesn't have a sub-object. In this case, the first object without a sub-object is \"x\".\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this question assumes a specific structure and organization of the provided input, and if this structure changes or there are other levels of nested objects, it may be necessary to follow different paths to find the first object's id."
