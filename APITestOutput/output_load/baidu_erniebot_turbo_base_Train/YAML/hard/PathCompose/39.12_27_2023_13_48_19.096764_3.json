The keys for each level are stored in a specific order in your input, so you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the root object, which has an id of \"p\".\n2. Then, follow the \"subs\" key to get to the sub-objects.\n3. In the sub-object for id \"q\", follow the \"subs\" key again to get to the nested object with id \"s\".\n4.
