        "Most deeply nested objects in your YAML file are the following object, which is an object within a dictionary within a list within another dictionary:\n\n\n```yaml\nsubs: \n- id: \"v\"\n  V: l,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"w\"\n    U: k,\n    T: j,\n    subs: []\n```\nThis object has a `subs` key that points to a list, which contains an object with `id` and `V` keys. The inner object has a `subs` key that points to an empty list.\n\nHere's the corresponding text with line breaks for better visibility:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"t\"\nZ: p,\nY: o,\nsubs: \n- id: \"u\"\n  X: n,\n  W: m,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"v\"       V: l,\n    subs: \n    - id: \"w\"      U: k,\n      T: j,       subs: []\n  - id: \"y\"       R: h,\n    Q: g,         QS: g,\n    subs: \n    - id: \"z\"      P: f,\n      P_S: f,     subs: []\n    - id: \"ab\"     O: e,\n      subs: []     subs: []\n```\nIf you want to find all deeply nested objects in a YAML file that are not of type list or dict, you can use a recursive function in Python that traverses the YAML structure and checks if each object is a list or dict. If it's not, you can print or do something with it. Here's an example of such a function:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\ndef find_non_list_dicts(obj):\n    if isinstance(obj, list):\n        for item in obj:\n            for result in find_non_list_dicts(item):\n                yield result\n    elif isinstance(obj, dict):\n        yield obj\n    else:\n        print(f\"Found non-list/dict object of type {type(obj).__name__}\")\n        yield obj\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:    \n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)    \n    for result in find_non_list_dicts(data):    \n        print(result)\n```\nRemember to replace `'your_file.yaml'` with the actual name of your YAML file. This script will traverse the YAML structure and print all non-list/dict objects it finds."
