It has a top-level key `subs` that points to a list of dictionaries. Each of these inner dictionaries has a `id` key and a `Y` key, and the innermost dictionary has a `subs` key that points to an empty list.\n\nHere's the corresponding text excerpt, separated by two newlines for readability:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"k\"\nZ: j,\nsubs: \n- id: \"l\"\n  Y: i\n  subs: \n  - id: \"m\"\n    X: h\n    subs: []\n```\nIf you want to extract this object from the YAML file, you can use a YAML parser like PyYAML or ruamel.yaml. Here's an example using ruamel.yaml:\n\n\n```python\nfrom ruamel.yaml import YAML\n\nyaml = YAML()\ndata = yaml.load(open('your_file.yaml'))  # replace 'your_file.yaml' with your actual file path\nnested_object = data['subs'][0]  # assuming there is only one `subs` key in the file\n```\nNow `nested_object` will contain the deeply nested object you are looking for. You can modify this code as needed to handle more complex YAML files."
