        "In the YAML format, a \"most deeply nested object\" would be an object where each key is not a list or dict type. The example you provided contains such an object.\n\nHere's the corresponding YAML content, separated by two newlines:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"k\"\nZ: s\nsubs: \n  - id: \"l\"\n    Y: r\n    subs: \n      - id: \"m\"\n        X: q\n        subs: {}\n```\nThe \"subs\" key is a nested object with no list or dict values. It has a \"subs\" key-value pair that is also a nested object with no list or dict values. And so on, recursively.\n\nIf you want to parse this YAML into a Python object, you can use a library like PyYAML. Here's an example of how you might do it:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\n# Parse the YAML string into a dictionary\nyaml_string = \"\"\"\nid: \"k\"\nZ: s\nsubs: \n  - id: \"l\"\n    Y: r\n    subs: \n      - id: \"m\"\n        X: q\n        subs: {}\n\"\"\"\nparsed_dict = yaml.safe_load(yaml_string)\n```\nNow `parsed_dict` will be a dictionary representing the structure you described in the YAML string. You can access its values using dot notation, e.g., `parsed_dict['id']` would return 'k'. You can also access nested values using the same syntax, e.g., `parsed_dict['subs'][0]['id']` would return 'l'."
