        "Based on your input, here is a nested object that does not contain lists or dictionaries:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"r\"\nZ: k\nsubs: \n- id: \"s\"\n  Y: j\n  subs: \n  - id: \"t\"\n    X: i\n    subs: <empty>\n```\nThis object is nested the deepest because there are no lists or dictionaries inside of it. The \"subs\" key contains a nested object with another \"subs\" key, which in turn has no value of type list or dict.\n\nIf you want to extract this object from the YAML file, you can use a YAML parser like PyYAML or ruamel.yaml. Here's an example using ruamel.yaml:\n\n\n```python\nfrom ruamel.yaml import YAML\n\nyaml = YAML()\ndata = yaml.load(open('your_file.yaml'))  # replace 'your_file.yaml' with your actual file path\ndeepest_nested_object = data['subs'][0]  # replace 'subs' with the actual key name\n```\nNote that you will need to install ruamel.yaml using pip or your package manager first. If you want to use PyYAML instead, it's a bit more involved as it doesn't support loading multiple levels of nesting directly from a file. You would need to handle that yourself using recursive functions or a recursive data structure."
