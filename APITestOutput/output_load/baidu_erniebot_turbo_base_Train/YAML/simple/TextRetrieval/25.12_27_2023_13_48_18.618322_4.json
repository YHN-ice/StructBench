It has a top-level key `subs` that points to a list of dictionaries. Each of these dictionaries has a `id` key, a `Y` key, and a `subs` key that points to an empty list.

It's more of a convention, and it can be slightly different depending on the specific implementation or tool. In this case, it seems to follow a four-space indentation convention, but it's not guaranteed to be exactly that in all cases."
