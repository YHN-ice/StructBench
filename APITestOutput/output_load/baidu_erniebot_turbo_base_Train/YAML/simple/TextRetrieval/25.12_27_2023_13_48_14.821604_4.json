It has a top-level key `subs` that points to a list of dictionaries. Each of these inner dictionaries has keys `id` and `Y`, which both have values `k` and `k` is a value at a deeper level of nesting.\n\nNote that it's an empty list (`[]`) at the final level, which indicates there are no further nested objects.\n\nIf you want to extract the nested structure from this YAML file, you can use a YAML parser like PyYAML or ruamel.yaml. Here's an example using PyYAML:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)\n\nnested_structure = data['subs']\n```\nThe `nested_structure` variable will now contain the nested structure you described above. If you want to further process this structure, you can do so based on the type of the nested structure (list or dict).\n\nNote that if you have more complex nested structures, it might be helpful to create a custom loader that can handle those more complex cases. You can also take a look at existing libraries like PyYAML's Extras or ruamel.yaml that might offer additional functionality for parsing and processing YAML data."
