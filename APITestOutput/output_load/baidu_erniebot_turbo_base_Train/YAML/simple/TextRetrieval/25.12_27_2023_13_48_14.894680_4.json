        "In the YAML format, a \"most deeply nested object\" would be an object that contains other objects as values within itself, with no values of type list or dict.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the input you provided:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"l\"\nZ: v\nsubs: \n- id: \"m\"\n  Y: u\n  subs: \n  - id: \"n\"\n    X: t\n    subs: []\n```\nThis object `subs` is a deeply nested object because it contains an object `m` within itself, which in turn contains an object `n` within its `subs` field. There are no values of type list or dict within this object.\n\nIf you want to represent this object in YAML, you can use the following syntax:\n\n\n```yaml\nsubs: \n  - &sub1\n    id: \"m\"\n    Y: u\n    subs: \n      - &sub2\n        id: \"n\"\n        X: t\n      subs: []\n```\nHere, `&sub1` and `&sub2` are references to the objects `m` and `n`, respectively. This allows you to avoid repeating the same object multiple times in the YAML file.\n\nIf you want to represent this object in JSON, you can use the following syntax:\n\nJSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"m\",\n      \"Y\": \"u\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"n\",\n          \"X\": \"t\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nNote that YAML and JSON have different syntax for representing nested objects, so you may need to adjust your code accordingly if you're converting between the two formats."
