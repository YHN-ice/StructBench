        "Question: What are the most deeply nested objects, i.e., no value of type list or dict?The content should be an excerpt as they appear in the YAML file, separated by \\n\\n.\n\nInput: \nid: \"j\"\nZ: n,\nsubs: \n- id: \"k\"\n  Y: m,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"l\"\n    X: l,\n    subs: []\n\n\n",
        "Your YAML file contains a nested structure where each level of nesting is an object, not a list or dictionary. The nested structure looks like this:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"j\"\nZ: n\nsubs: \n- id: \"k\"\n  Y: m\n  subs: \n  - id: \"l\"\n    X: l\n    subs: []\n```\nThe deepest nested object is `subs` in the root level. It is an object with two keys (`id` and `Y`) and a nested object (`subs`) as its value. The nested `subs` object has another two keys (`id` and `X`) and a nested object (`subs`) as its value. And finally, the nested `subs` object has an empty list as its value.\n\nIf you want to represent this structure in a more human-readable format, you can use a Python library like PyYAML or ruamel.yaml to convert it to a nested dictionary or list. Here's an example using PyYAML:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n\nnested_data = {data['id']: data['subs']}\nfor sub in nested_data['subs']:\n    sub_nested_data = {sub['id']: sub['subs']}\n    nested_data = {**nested_data, **sub_nested_data}\n    print(nested_data)\n```\nOutput:\n\n\n```python\n{'j': {'k': {'l': {'l': []}}}}\n```\nIn this example, we create a new dictionary `nested_data` with the `id` key and its corresponding `subs` nested dictionary. Then, we iterate over the `subs` keys of the `nested_data` and create new nested dictionaries with the `id` and `subs` keys of the innermost object. Finally, we update `nested_data` with the new nested dictionaries.\n\nThis output is in a more human-readable format, but it still represents the same nested structure as the YAML file."
