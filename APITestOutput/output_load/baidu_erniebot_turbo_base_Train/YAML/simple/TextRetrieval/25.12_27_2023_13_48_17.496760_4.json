It has a top-level key `subs` that points to a list of dictionaries. Each of these inner dictionaries has a `id` key and a `Y` key, and the innermost dictionary has a `subs` key that points to an empty list.\n\nIf you want to extract this object as a single value, you can use a YAML library like PyYAML or ruamel.yaml to convert the YAML file to Python data structures. Here's an example using PyYAML:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n\nnested_object = data['subs'][0]  # Assuming there's only one sub-dictionary in the list\n```\nThis will give you the deeply nested object as a Python dictionary. If you want to convert it to a string, you can use str() function:\n\n\n```python\nstringified_object = str(nested_object)\n```\nThis will give you the object represented as a string, suitable for copying and pasting into your question. Note that this assumes your YAML file has exactly one deeply nested object. If there are multiple, you'll need to iterate over the list of sub-dictionaries."
