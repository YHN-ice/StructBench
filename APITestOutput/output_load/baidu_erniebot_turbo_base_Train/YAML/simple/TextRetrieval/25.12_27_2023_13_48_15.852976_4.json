It contains a key `id` with the value `\"j\"` and another key `Y` with the value `\"j\"`. Inside these keys, there are nested dictionaries with `id` as the top-level key and `X` and `subs` as its children, both of which are empty dictionaries (`{}`).\n\nThe excerpt you provided follows the same structure and nesting level. Here is how it might look like separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```yaml\nsubs: \n- id: \"i\"\n  Y: j\n  subs: \n    - id: \"k\"\n      X: i\n      subs: []\n```\nIf you want to extract this object from the YAML file, you can use a YAML parser like PyYAML or ruamel.yaml. Here's an example using PyYAML:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n    deeply_nested_object = data['subs'][0]  # Assuming there's only one 'subs' object in the file\n```\nThis code will open your YAML file, load the data into a dictionary, and extract the deeply nested object you're interested in. You can then use this object as you need."
