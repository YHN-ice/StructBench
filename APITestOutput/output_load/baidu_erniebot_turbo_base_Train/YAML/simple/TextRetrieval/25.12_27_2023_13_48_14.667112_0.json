Each of these nested arrays represents a set of attributes for the same object (e.g., id, Y, X).\n\nIn YAML, objects are typically defined within a sequence of objects. Each object can have a set of attributes (properties) and their values. The sequence is enclosed within square brackets.\n\nThe specific structure of this object (id a) in YAML would be:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"a\"\nZ:\n  - u\nsubs:\n  - id: \"b\"\n    Y: t\n    subs:\n      - id: \"c\"\n        X: s\n```\nSo, if you want to know what object with id a is, you can access it by using the id attribute from the array Z. If you have access to the entire YAML document, you can use the following code to access it:\n\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have a YAML document in a variable named doc\nobject_with_id_a = doc['Z'][0]  # This will get the first object in the array Z\n```\nIf you want to access the nested attributes (id, Y, X), you can use the same method as above, but with additional levels of indexing:\n\n\n```python\nobject_with_id_a = doc['Z'][0]['subs'][0]  # This will get the first object in the nested array subs of Z[0]\n```\nRemember that YAML is case-sensitive and indentation is crucial for proper parsing. You should always use the same indentation for all attributes in each level."
