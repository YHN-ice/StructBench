        "The object with id \"r\" is an array that contains nested objects. It itself has an id, Y, and subs array. Each of these nested objects has an id, X, and subs array as well. However, there are no keys named \"j\" or \"i\" in the top-level objects, so the YAML file does not contain the requested excerpt.\n\nHere's the YAML file as it appears in the input:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"q\"\nZ: k,\nsubs: \n- id: \"r\"\n  Y: j,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"s\"\n    X: i,\n    subs: []\n```\nTo retrieve an excerpt containing just the objects with id \"r\", you can filter through the objects to extract only those with a matching id. This could be done with a recursive Python script using a custom matcher function that traverses the object tree. Alternatively, you can use a YAML library such as PyYAML to parse the YAML file and perform the filtering in Python.\n\nHere's an example using PyYAML:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\ndef extract_objects_with_id(data, id):\n    result = []\n    for obj in data:\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            if obj['id'] == id:\n                result.append(obj)\n            for sub_obj in obj.get('subs', []):\n                result.extend(extract_objects_with_id(sub_obj, id))\n    return result\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n    objects = extract_objects_with_id(data, 'r')\n    print(objects)\n```\nThis script will extract all objects with id \"r\" from the YAML file and print them to the console. You can adjust the script as needed to include nested objects and filter out additional properties based on your requirements."
