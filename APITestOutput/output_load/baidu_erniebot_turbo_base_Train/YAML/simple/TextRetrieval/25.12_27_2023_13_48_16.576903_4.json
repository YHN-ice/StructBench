The `subs` of `id` also has a third-level child `subs` with no value of type list or dict.\n\nIf you want to extract this object as a single line, you can use the following YAML code:\n\n\n```yaml\nsubs: \"id: \\\"i\\\", X: l,\" subs: []\"\n```\nThis code uses the YAML multi-line string feature to represent the object as a single line. It also uses quotes to represent the values of `id` and `X`, which are strings. The value of `subs` is represented as a string with the correct indentation and quotes.\n\nIf you want to remove the leading and trailing spaces from the extracted line, you can use the following code:\n\n\n```yaml\nsubs: \"id:i\\nX:l\\nsubs:\\n\\n\"\n```\nThis code uses additional newline characters to move the values closer to the end of the line, without changing their appearance.
