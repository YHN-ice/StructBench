It has a top-level key `subs` that points to a list of dictionaries. Each of these inner dictionaries has a `id` key and an `X` key, and some of them have a `subs` key that points to an empty list.\n\nIf you want to extract this object as a Python dictionary, you can use a YAML library like PyYAML or ruamel.yaml to parse the YAML file and convert it to a Python dictionary. Here's an example using PyYAML:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n    deeply_nested_object = data['subs'][0]\n\nprint(deeply_nested_object)\n```\nOutput:\n\n\n```yaml\n{u'id': u't', 'X': u's', 'subs': [{u'id': u'u', 'subs': []}]}\n```\nThis code extracts the deeply nested object and prints it as a Python dictionary. Note that the output is a dictionary with keys in different formats depending on the original YAML file. If you want to convert it to a specific format, you can modify the code accordingly."
