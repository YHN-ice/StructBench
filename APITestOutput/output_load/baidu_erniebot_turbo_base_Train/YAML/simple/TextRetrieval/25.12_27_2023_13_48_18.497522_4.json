        "In the YAML format, a \"nested object\" refers to an object that contains other objects within it. In your example, the \"subs\" object is nested within the \"id\" object, and the \"subs\" object itself contains another nested object called \"Y\".\n\nHere's an excerpt of the YAML file you provided, separated by \\n\\n:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"n\"\nZ: b,\nsubs: \n- id: \"o\"\n  Y: a,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"p\"\n    X: zy\n    subs: []\n```\nThe most deeply nested object is the \"subs\" object within the \"id\" object. It does not contain a list or dict as its type, but it does contain another nested object called \"Y\".\n\nIf you want to extract this nested structure into a Python dictionary, you can use a library like PyYAML to do so. Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n    nested_dict = data['subs']\n```\nThis will create a nested dictionary with the structure you provided in the YAML file. The 'subs' key will be mapped to a dictionary that contains the nested objects within it. You can then access these objects using dot notation, such as `nested_dict['o']['Y']` to get the value 'a'."
