This object in turn has a \"Y\" property, which points to an object with an id of \"a\" and a \"subs\" property. This \"subs\" property also points to an object with an id of \"x\", and it also has a nested object \"X\" with an id of \"zy\" and a \"subs\" property that is empty.\n\nSo, if you are asking for the first object's id that has a direct \"subs\" property, then the answer would be \"w\".
