The nested objects in \"subs\" do not have their own id, but rather reference the id of their parent object.\n\nThe nested object \"k\" in the root object \"id: \\\"j\\\"\" has a reference to its parent object \"j\" in its \"id\" field, which is also \"j\". The nested object \"l\" in \"k\" refers to its parent object \"k\", which is also \"j\". However, there is no direct reference from the nested object \"l\" to its parent object in the next level, so it has no id.\n\nIf you are looking for a reference that does not require parent-child relationship or key-value pairings, then it is best to have an additional property like 'objectId' in the structure, where you can map all the ids explicitly. This way you can track any relationship that you need between different objects."
