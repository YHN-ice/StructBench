Since JSON doesn't have a direct concept of \"first object\", I'm not sure what you mean by this question. However, if you want to access the first item in a list or array, you can use Python's indexing notation, such as `my_list[0]` for accessing the first item in a list `my_list`. In this case, the first item in the \"subs\" list would be an object with an id of \"x\". If you provide more context for this question, I might be able to provide a more specific answer."
