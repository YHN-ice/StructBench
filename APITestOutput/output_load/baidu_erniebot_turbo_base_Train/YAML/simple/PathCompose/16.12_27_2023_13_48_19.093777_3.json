        "To access the value \"k\" in the nested JSON structure, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Start with the root object, which is the object with id: \"g\".\n2. Find the \"subs\" property in the \"g\" object.\n3. Inside the \"subs\" property, find the nested object with id: \"h\".\n4. Inside the \"h\" object, find the \"subs\" property again.\n5. Inside the \"subs\" property of the \"h\" object, find the nested object with id: \"i\".\n6.

It first converts the JSON string to a Python dictionary using `json.loads()` and then accesses the value \"k\" using the provided steps."
