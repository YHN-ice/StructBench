Then, you need to navigate to the `subs` array in the `id` of \"t\".\n3. Inside the `subs` array, you need to find the object with an `id` of \"u\".\n4. Inside that object, you will find an `X` value, which will be \"p\".\n\nTo perform these steps, you can use a programming language such as Python, JavaScript, or Go with libraries such as jsonpath or JSON Pointer.\n\nHere's an example using Python with jsonpath-ng:\n\n\n```python\nimport jsonpath\n\njson_str = '''\n{\n  \"id\": \"s\",\n  \"Z\": \"r\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"t\",\n      \"Y\": \"q\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"u\",\n          \"X\": \"p\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n'''\n\nobj = jsonpath.parse(json_str)\nresult = obj.path(\"$.subs[0].subs[0].X\")\nprint(result.value)  # Output: p\n```\nThis code uses jsonpath-ng to navigate the JSON structure and returns the value \"p\". You can replace the `path` function with your desired path expression to access different values in the JSON structure."
