        "In the provided input, you can access the value \"d\" through a recursive depth-first traversal. Assuming you are accessing it using a dictionary object like in your question, you can do the following:\n\n1. Get the first level dictionary\n2. Iterate over each element of the first level dictionary\n3. For each element, if it's a dictionary, get the next level dictionary and repeat the process.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Python:\n\n\n```python\ndef get_value(obj, keys):\n    if keys:\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            if keys[0] in obj:\n                return get_value(obj[keys[0]], keys[1:])\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):\n            for i in range(len(obj)):\n                if get_value(obj[i], keys):\n                    return True\n    return False\n\nobj = {\n    \"id\": \"e\",\n    \"Z\": \"f\",\n    \"subs\": {\n        \"id\": \"f\",\n        \"Y\": \"e\",\n        \"subs\": {\n            \"id\": \"g\",\n            \"X\": \"d\",\n            \"subs\": []\n        }\n    }\n}\nkeys = [\"subs\", \"id\", \"X\"]  # The keys you want to access\nprint(get_value(obj, keys))  # Prints: d\n```\nIn this example, `get_value` function recursively traverses the object until it finds the specified key or returns False. It starts with the first level of the object and moves to the next level until it reaches the desired key. The keys you want to access are specified in the `keys` variable. This implementation assumes that your object follows the structure you provided. If your object structure changes, you may need to adjust the function accordingly."
