For example, if you wanted to access \"g\", you would do obj[\"j\"][\"Z\"][\"subs\"][0][\"id\"] which would give you \"k\". Then you would follow the same pattern again to get to \"g\" like obj[\"k\"][\"Y\"][\"subs\"][0][\"id\"] which would give you \"l\".\n\nYou can continue this process until you reach the desired value.
