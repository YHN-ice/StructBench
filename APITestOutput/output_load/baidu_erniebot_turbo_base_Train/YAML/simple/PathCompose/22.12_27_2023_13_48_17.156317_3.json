        "To access the value \"c\" in the given JSON structure, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the root object, which has an `id` of \"l\" and a `subs` array.\n2. Inside the `subs` array, find the object with an `id` of \"m\".\n3. Inside that object, find the `subs` array again and access the first item in it, which has an `id` of \"n\".\n4. Inside that `subs` array, you will find an object with an `X` key whose value is \"b\".\n5. Finally, you want to access the value \"c\" which is located inside the `Y` key of the previous object.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_string = '''\n{\n    \"id\": \"l\",\n    \"Z\": \"d\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"m\",\n            \"Y\": \"c\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"n\",\n                    \"X\": \"b\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n'''\n\n# Convert JSON string to Python dictionary\njson_dict = json.loads(json_string)\n\n# Access the value 'c' using path-based access (similar to accessing a nested dictionary)\nvalue_c = json_dict['subs'][0]['subs'][0]['subs'][0]['Y']\nprint(value_c)  # Output: c\n```\nThis code will print the value \"c\". Note that it uses a path-based access similar to accessing a nested dictionary in Python. This allows you to navigate through nested JSON structures and access specific values without having to loop through each level of the structure."
