        "To access the value \"t\" in the provided input, you can follow the given pattern by using the obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]... approach.\n\nIn your case, you have an object with nested objects and you want to access \"t\" value in the deepest nested object (\"subs\").\n\nTo do this, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Extract the relevant keys and indexes from the input using a programming language-specific method. For example, in JavaScript, you can use the split() method and string indexing to extract the keys.\n2. Use the extracted keys and indexes to access the desired value \"t\" in the nested object.\n\nHere's an example in JavaScript:\n\n\n```javascript\nlet obj = {\n  id: \"v\",\n  Z: \"t\",\n  subs: [\n    {\n      id: \"w\",\n      Y: \"s\",\n      subs: [\n        {\n          id: \"x\",\n          X: \"r\",\n          subs: []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\n// Extract the keys and indexes from input\nlet keys = [\"subs\", 1, \"id\", \"X\"]; // Example keys extracted from input above\nlet value = obj[keys[0]][keys[1]][keys[2]]; // Access desired value using extracted keys and indexes\nconsole.log(value); // Output: \"r\"\n```\nIn this example, we used the extracted keys [\"subs\", 1, \"id\", \"X\"] to access the value \"r\" from the nested object. You can adjust the keys based on your actual input structure."
