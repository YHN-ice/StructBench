        "To access the value \"k\" in the nested JSON structure, you can follow the given pattern and use the keys to traverse through the structure.

We access the value \"k\" by following the path `\"subs\"` -> `[0]` -> `\"subs\"` -> `[1]` -> `\"Y\"`. Please note that this assumes that the structure is always the same and that there are no missing keys or unexpected nested structures. If your JSON structure is more complex or contains unexpected values, you may need to adjust the path accordingly."
