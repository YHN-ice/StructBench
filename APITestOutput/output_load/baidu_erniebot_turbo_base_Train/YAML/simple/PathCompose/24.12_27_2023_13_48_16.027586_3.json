        "Question: How to access value \"g\"? Answer should be like obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]...\n\nInput: \nid: \"n\"\nZ: g,\nsubs: \n- id: \"o\"\n  Y: f,\n  subs: \n  - id: \"p\"\n    X: e,\n    subs: []\n\n\n",
        "Based on your input, the value \"g\" can be accessed by using the following path:\n\nobj[\"n\"][\"Z\"][\"g\"]\n\nIf you have other keys or indexes you want to access \"g\" with, you can use a similar approach. For example, if you want to access \"g\" using index 1, you would use obj[1][\"n\"][\"Z\"][\"g\"]. You can continue this process for any number of keys or indexes you want to use.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to access \"g\" using multiple keys and indexes:\n\n\n```python\n# Define your object\nobj = {\n    \"id\": \"n\",\n    \"Z\": \"g\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"o\",\n            \"Y\": \"f\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"p\",\n                    \"X\": \"e\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n# Access \"g\" using multiple keys and indexes\nvalue = obj[\"id\"]                       # Get the id value\nid_obj = obj[value]                     # Get the object with id value\nZ_obj = id_obj[\"Z\"]                    # Get the object with Z key value\ng_value = Z_obj[\"g\"]                    # Access the value \"g\"\nprint(g_value)  # Output: g\n```\nIn this example, we start by getting the \"id\" value from the object using obj[\"id\"]. Then, we use this value to get the object with the corresponding id from the \"subs\" list. We continue this process until we reach the object with the desired key (\"Z\") and then access the value \"g\"."
