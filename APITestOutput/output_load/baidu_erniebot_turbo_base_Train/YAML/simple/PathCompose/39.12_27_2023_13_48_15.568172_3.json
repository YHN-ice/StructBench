        "To access the value \"s\" in the nested structure, you can follow the given pattern:\n\n\n```python\nobj = {\n    \"id\": \"d\",\n    \"Z\": \"t\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"e\",\n            \"Y\": \"s\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"f\",\n                    \"X\": \"r\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nkey_path = [\"subs\", 0, \"subs\", 1, \"Y\"]\nvalue = obj[key_path[0]][key_path[1]][key_path[2]]\nprint(value)  # Output: s\n```\nHere's what the code is doing:\n\n* First, it defines the `obj` variable containing the nested structure.\n* Then, it defines a `key_path` variable containing the sequence of keys to traverse to reach the desired value. The `key_path` here is `[\"subs\", 0, \"subs\", 1, \"Y\"]` because it needs to start with the outer level key (\"subs\"), then index 0 of that list, then index 1 of the inner level key (\"subs\"), and finally index 1 of that inner list's key (\"Y\").\n* Finally, it uses this `key_path` to access the value \"s\" using `obj[key_path[0]][key_path[1]][key_path[2]]`. This will return the value \"s\".\n\nRemember that if you're dealing with large or complex nested structures, it's important to have a clear understanding of how the data is organized and how you're accessing it. If you have more complex needs or want to access multiple values, you might want to consider using a data structure library like Pandas in Python."
