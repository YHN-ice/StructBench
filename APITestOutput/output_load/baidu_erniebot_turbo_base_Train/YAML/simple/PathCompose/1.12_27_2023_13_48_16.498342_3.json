        "To access the value \"p\" in the given JSON structure, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Start with the root object, which has an `id` of \"o\" and a `subs` array.\n2. Iterate through the `subs` array until you find an object with an `id` of \"p\".\n3. Inside the object with `id` of \"p\", you will find an `Y` key with a value of \"p\" and a `subs` array.\n4.
