        "If you have an object like the one you provided, where the values you are interested in (here \"u\") are nested in sub-objects, you can access them using the syntax you provided. You need to know the key path to follow, starting from the object itself, until you reach the value you are looking for.\n\nFor your specific example, the path would be `obj[\"subs\"][1][\"subs\"][-1][\"X\"]` which would give you \"u\".\n\nIf you don't know the exact key path beforehand, you can use a recursive function to navigate through the object. Here's an example:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction accessValue(obj, path) {\n    let keys = path.split(\".\");\n    let value = obj;\n    for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {\n        if (value[keys[i]] !== undefined) {\n            value = value[keys[i]];\n        } else {\n            return undefined; // or throw an error if you want\n        }\n    }\n    return value;\n}\n```\nYou can use this function like this: `accessValue(obj, \"subs[1].subs[-1].X\")` which would give you \"u\".\n\nRemember that this assumes your object structure is always the same and that you know the exact path to your value. If your object structure changes or if you don't know the exact path, you might need a different approach."
