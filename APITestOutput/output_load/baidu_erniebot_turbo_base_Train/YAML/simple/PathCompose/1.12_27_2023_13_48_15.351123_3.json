        "To access the value \"p\" in the given JSON structure, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Start by identifying the root object in the JSON structure. In this case, it's \"subs\".\n2. Iterate through each nested object in the root object (\"subs\") until you find the one with the id \"j\".\n3. Inside that nested object, you'll find an attribute named \"X\" with a value of \"o\". The value you're looking for is \"p\", which is inside the attribute named \"Y\".\n\nIn Python, you can achieve this with the following code:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_string = \"\"\"\n{\n  \"id\": \"h\",\n  \"Z\": \"q\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"i\",\n      \"Y\": \"p\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"j\",\n          \"X\": \"o\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Convert JSON string to Python dictionary\njson_data = json.loads(json_string)\n\n# Find the nested object with id \"j\" and access its \"Y\" attribute\nvalue_p = next((item for item in json_data['subs'] if item['id'] == 'j'), None)[0]['Y']\nprint(value_p)  # Output: p\n```\nIn this code, `json.loads()` converts the JSON string to a Python dictionary. Then, we use a list comprehension with a `next()` function to find the nested object with id \"j\" and access its \"Y\" attribute. Finally, we print the value of \"p\"."
