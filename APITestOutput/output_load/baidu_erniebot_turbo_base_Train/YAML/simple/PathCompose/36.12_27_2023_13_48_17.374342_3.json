        "To access the value \"e\" in the nested structure, you can follow the given pattern to traverse through the keys or indices.

Then, we traverse through the `subs` key to access the nested structure. We use `obj[\"subs\"][0]` to access the first level of sub-objects, and then use `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"]` to access the second level of sub-objects. Finally, we use `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][-1]` to access the last level of sub-objects with the key `X`. The value of interest is stored in `value`.\n\nMake sure to adjust the indices or keys based on the actual structure of your data."
