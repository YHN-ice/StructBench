You want to access this value \"k\".\n\nTo access this value, you can use a combination of index and key based access in the nested object. You can use the `id` of \"j\" as the key to access the `subs` object, and then use the `X` key to access the value \"k\".\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n\n```javascript\nlet obj = {\n  id: \"h\",\n  Z: m,\n  subs: {\n    id: \"i\",\n    Y: l,\n    subs: [{\n      id: \"j\",\n      X: \"k\",\n      subs: []\n    }]\n  }\n};\n\nlet value = obj.subs[2]['subs'][0]['X']; // Assuming 'subs' has only 3 levels\nconsole.log(value); // Outputs: k\n```\nNote that the `obj.subs[2]['subs'][0]['X']` is used here because the structure has 3 levels (root -> subs -> X). You can adjust this according to your actual structure. If you have more levels, you'll need to adjust the indices accordingly."
