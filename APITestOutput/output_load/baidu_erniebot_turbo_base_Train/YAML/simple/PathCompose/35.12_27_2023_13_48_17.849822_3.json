Assuming you want to access \"y\" through \"id\" = \"u\", \"id\" = \"v\", and \"id\" = \"w\", you can do the following:\n\n1. First, get the array `subs` for `id` = \"u\".\n2. Then, get the array `subs` for `id` = \"v\" from the previous array.\n3. Finally, get the value \"y\" from the `subs` array for `id` = \"w\".\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this in JavaScript:\n\n\n```javascript\nlet obj = {\n  id: \"u\",\n  Z: \"y\",\n  subs: [\n    {\n      id: \"v\",\n      Y: \"x\",\n      subs: [\n        {\n          id: \"w\",\n          X: \"w\",\n          subs: []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\nlet index1 = 0; // index of 'id' = 'u' in the 'subs' array\nlet index2 = 1; // index of 'id' = 'v' in the previous array\nlet value = obj.subs[index2].subs[index1].Z; // Accessing 'y'\nconsole.log(value); // logs \"y\"\n```\nPlease note that the indexes might not be exactly what you expect based on your input.
