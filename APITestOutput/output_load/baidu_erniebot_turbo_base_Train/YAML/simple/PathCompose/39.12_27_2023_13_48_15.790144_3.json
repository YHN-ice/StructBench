Then, we access the value \"a\" from the nested \"subs\" array using the index 0 again. The final result is the value \"a\". You can follow similar steps to access other values as well.

If there might be missing keys or indices, you might want to use a more robust approach like checking for the existence of keys or indices before accessing them."
