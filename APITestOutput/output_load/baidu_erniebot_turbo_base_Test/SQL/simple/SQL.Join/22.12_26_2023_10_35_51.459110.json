For example, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE company = 'NY' AND height > 158\n```\n\nThis query will return the number of employees who work in New York and are taller than 158 cm.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that this query assumes that the database contains a table called \"employees\" with the columns mentioned in your question.
