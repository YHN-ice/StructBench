        "In order to answer this question, you need to gather some information about people who work in TX. You can refer to the employee table and the location table. You can use the employee table to get the information of TX workers and the location table to get the information of TX.\n\nThe answer depends on how tall is 158, and whether there are any tall people in TX. If 158 is a standard height, then there are 3 people who work in TX who are taller than 158. If 158 is a tall height, then there are no people who work in TX who are taller than 158.\n\nIf you want to know how many people who work in TX are taller than a certain height, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee WHERE location = 'TX' AND height > 158;\n```\n\nThis query will return the number of people who work in TX and are taller than 158. If you want to know how many people who work in TX are taller than a certain height, you can replace 'height > 158' with 'height > your_height' and replace 'your_height' with the height you want to compare.\n\nHowever, this question seems to be very vague and there is no specific information about what height is being compared. If you can provide more specific information, I will be able to provide a more accurate answer."
