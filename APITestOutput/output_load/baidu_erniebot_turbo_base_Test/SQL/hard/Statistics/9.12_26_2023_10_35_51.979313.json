        "The salary information you provided is in a table format. To answer your question, you need to count the number of people who have a salary greater than 196703.\n\nTo do this, you can use a query in your database management system (DBMS) to retrieve the salary information and filter out those with a salary greater than 196703. Here's an example query in SQL:\n\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCount\nFROM salary_table\nWHERE salary > 196703;\n```\nIn this query, the `salary_table` is the name of your salary table, and `WHERE salary > 196703` is the condition to filter out the rows with a salary greater than 196703. The `COUNT(*)` function will return the number of rows that meet this condition, and the `AS TotalCount` is used to give the result a meaningful name.\n\nYou can replace `salary_table` with the actual name of your salary table in your DBMS. If you're using a different DBMS, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.\n\nAfter running the query, you will get the number of people who have a salary greater than 196703."
