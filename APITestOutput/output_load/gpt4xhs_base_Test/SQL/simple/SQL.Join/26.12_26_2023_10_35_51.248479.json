The person's height must be greater than 171 cm.\n2. The person must be employed, implying they have a job and a location listed.\n\nLet's analyze the data:\n\n- **a**: Height is 184 cm, but status is retired, so not currently working.\n- **b**: Height is 144 cm, employed, but works in WA, not IL.\n- **c**: Height is 127 cm, unemployed, so not working.\n- **d**: Height is 197 cm, but status is retired, so not currently working.\n- **e**: Height is 197 cm, employed, but works in GA, not IL.\n- **f**: Height is 207 cm, but status is retired, so not currently working.\n- **g**: Height is 184 cm, but status is retired, so not currently working.\n- **h**: Height is 191 cm, but status is retired, so not currently working.\n\nAccording to the data provided, there are no people who are both taller than 171 cm and currently employed in Illinois (IL), as there are no employees listed with a company location in IL. Therefore, the answer is zero."
