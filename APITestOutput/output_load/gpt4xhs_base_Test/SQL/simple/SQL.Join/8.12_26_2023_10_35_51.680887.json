        "To determine how many people who work in IL are taller than 168 cm, we need to look at the \"height\" and \"location\" columns and count the number of entries that meet the criteria.\n\nFrom the provided input:\n\n- The person with primeKey `f` is male, 21 years old, named `r`, with a height of 157 cm, and works at Microsoft in IL. This person does not meet the height criterion, as 157 cm is less than 168 cm.\n- The person with primeKey `g` is female, 40 years old, named `s`, with a height of 217 cm, and is unemployed but is associated with Meta in IL. This person meets the height criterion, as 217 cm is greater than 168 cm.\n\nTherefore, among the people listed, only one person (primeKey `g`) is taller than 168 cm and is associated with a company in IL. However, please note that this person is not employed (unemployed), so if we consider only employed individuals, then the count would be zero. If we consider unemployed individuals as well who are associated with a company in IL, the count is one."
