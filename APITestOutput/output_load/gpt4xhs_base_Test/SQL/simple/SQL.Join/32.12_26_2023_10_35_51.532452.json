Instead, it lists individuals with the locations \"HI\", \"CA\", \"NY\", and \"WA\", which correspond to the states of Hawaii, California, New York, and Washington, respectively.\n\nBased on the given data:\n\n- Person with primeKey 'a' is located in HI.\n- Person with primeKey 'b' is located in CA.\n- Person with primeKey 'c' is located in NY.\n- Person with primeKey 'd' is located in WA.\n\nWithout any individuals listed as being in Georgia (GA), we cannot determine how many people work in GA and are taller than 180 cm from this dataset. If you meant to refer to the company \"Google\" as \"GA,\" then none of the people listed work for a company with the abbreviation \"GA.\" However, if there's a different interpretation of \"GA\" that matches an individual's data here, please clarify, and I will provide an updated answer."
