        "According to the input data provided, there are two people who work in WA (Washington state) and are taller than 153 centimeters. These are:\n\n1. Person with primeKey 'b' (male, age 68, height 195 cm) - employed at Meta in TX (assuming TX stands for Texas, not Washington state, this person does not actually work in WA).\n2. Person with primeKey 'c' (female, age 53, height 187 cm) - employed at OPENAI in HI (assuming HI stands for Hawaii, not Washington state, this person does not actually work in WA either).\n\nHowever, there seems to be a misunderstanding. The locations provided in the input data are NY (New York), TX (Texas), and HI (Hawaii), not WA (Washington). Therefore, none of the individuals listed in the input data work in WA.\n\nIf we overlook the requirement that they need to work in WA and just focus on height, then two individuals are taller than 153 centimeters and are employed:\n\n1. Person 'b' with a height of 195 cm.\n2. Person 'c' with a height of 187 cm.\n\nPerson 'd' is shorter than 153 cm and thus does not meet the height criterion. However, if you meant the question to include all individuals taller than 153 cm regardless of their employment status or location, then three individuals—persons 'a', 'b', and 'c'—are taller than 153 cm."
