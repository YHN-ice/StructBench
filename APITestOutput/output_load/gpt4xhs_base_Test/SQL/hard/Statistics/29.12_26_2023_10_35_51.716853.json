        "To determine how many people work with a salary of more than $75,033, we need to look at the \"salary\" column in the second part of your input table and count the number of individuals whose salary is higher than $75,033.\n\nBased on the provided data, we can see the salaries listed for each individual with a 'primeKey':\n\n- a: $725,109\n- b: $178,956\n- c: $634,242\n- d: $677,093\n- e: $831,021 (Note: This individual is unemployed, however, they still have a listed salary. Assuming this might be a mistake or past salary before unemployment. Whether to count this depends on the specific criteria for the question, which isn't stated here.)\n- f: $48,071\n- g: $37,742 (Note: This individual is unemployed.)\n- h: $714,075\n- i: $240,786\n- j: $322,484\n- k: $395,386\n- l: $317,424\n\nCounting the individuals with salaries above $75,033 and excluding those who are unemployed or retired:\n\n1. a - Employed, salary is above $75,033.\n2. b - Employed, salary is above $75,033.\n3. c - Employed, salary is above $75,033.\n4. d - Employed, salary is above $75,033.\n5. h - Retired (may not be considered \"working\" depending on the context of the question).\n6. i - Employed, salary is above $75,033.\n7. j - Employed, salary is above $75,033.\n8. k - Employed, salary is above $75,033.\n9. l - Employed, salary is above $75,033.\n\nSo there are 8 people who are employed and have a salary more than $75,033.
