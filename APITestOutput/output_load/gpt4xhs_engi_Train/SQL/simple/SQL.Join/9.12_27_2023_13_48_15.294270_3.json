        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in IL are taller than 176?\", we will need to parse the datatable and filter the entries based on the following criteria:\n\n1. The `location` must be 'IL' (Illinois) to ensure that we are only considering people who work in Illinois.\n2. The `height` must be greater than 176 to meet the specified height requirement.\n\nBased on the input provided, let's match the records:\n\n1. The `primeKey` links personal information with employment information.\n2. We are interested in the `height` and `location` fields, specifically those with a height greater than 176 and a location of 'IL'.\n\nLet's apply these criteria to each of the given records:\n\n- Record a: height = 178, location = IL (meets both criteria)\n- Record b: height = 146, location = WA (does not meet either criterion)\n- Record c: height = 204, location = NY (does not meet location criterion)\n- Record d: height = 202, location = NY (does not meet location criterion)\n- Record e: height = 220, location = GA (does not meet location criterion)\n- Record f: height = 150, location = GA (does not meet either criterion)\n\nAfter applying the filters for both height and location, only one person (record a) meets both criteria: employed in IL and taller than 176.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there is 1 person who works in IL and is taller than 176 centimeters."
