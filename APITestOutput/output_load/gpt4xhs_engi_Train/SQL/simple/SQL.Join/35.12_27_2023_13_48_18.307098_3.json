Optimizing queries or using tools to handle large datasets efficiently will be essential.\n\n7. **Unit Consistency**: Height could be recorded in different units (e.g., centimeters vs. inches).

        "Given the data tables and the task at hand, the primary challenge is to determine the number of employed individuals in the dataset who are taller than 178 cm, and who work in the state of Georgia (abbreviated as GA). However, based on the information provided, there are a few notable issues:\n\n- There is no clear indication that any of these individuals work in Georgia. The \"location\" column includes abbreviations such as \"HI,\" \"NY,\" and \"CA,\" which correspond to Hawaii, New York, and California, respectively. There is no mention of \"GA\" in the location data provided.\n- Height is provided in centimeters, so we can directly compare it to the value of 178 cm.\n- The \"status\" column indicates whether an individual is employed or unemployed. We only need to consider individuals who are employed.\n- The dataset provided is too small to assess issues related to large data volumes or multiple entries per individual.\n\nGiven these observations, we can proceed to count the number of employed individuals taller than 178 cm. However, since no one is listed as working in GA, and the only employed individual (primeKey 'a') works in HI (Hawaii), the answer to the question is:\n\n**Zero**, based on the dataset provided, because there are no records of employed persons working in Georgia (GA). \n\nIf you intended to ask about Hawaii (HI) or there was a typo in your question, then we would need to consider the height of person 'a' who is employed and works in HI.
