Here are some obstacles that could be encountered when attempting to determine how many people who work in GA are taller than 153:\n\n1. Multiple Tables: If the data is split across multiple tables with a common primeKey, correlating the height information with the state of employment would be necessary.\n\n2. Data Consistency: Heights could be recorded in different units (centimeters, meters, feet, inches), requiring normalization to a single unit for comparison.\n\n3. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows might not have complete information regarding height or state of employment, making it difficult to include or exclude them from the count accurately.\n\n4. Data Format: The height data might be in a format that is not directly comparable to the number 153 (for example, as a string with units attached). Parsing and converting to a numeric value would be necessary.\n\n5. Errors and Outliers: The dataset may contain errors or outliers which need to be identified and handled appropriately.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: The state codes might be case-sensitive, and the table could have inconsistent casing (e.g., 'GA' vs 'ga'), requiring case normalization for accurate comparison.\n\n7. Duplicate Entries: There may be duplicates or multiple entries for the same person (same primeKey) that should only be counted once.\n\n8. Performance Issues: If the dataset is very large, there may be performance considerations that affect how quickly and efficiently the data can be processed.\n\n9. Ambiguous Column Names: If column names are not clear or standardized across tables (e.g., 'height' vs 'tall'), identifying the correct data to use might be challenging.\n\n10. Logical Errors: Incorrect interpretation of conditions (e.g., misunderstanding \"taller than 153\" to include 153) can lead to incorrect counts.\n\nUnderstanding and overcoming these obstacles is crucial for accurately parsing the datatables and providing the correct answer."

        "To tackle the problem, we should begin by correlating the height information with the employment location using the common primeKey in both tables.
