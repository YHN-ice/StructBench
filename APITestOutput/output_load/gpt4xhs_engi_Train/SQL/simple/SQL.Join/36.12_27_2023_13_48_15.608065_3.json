Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to determine how many people who work in the state of Hawaii (HI) are taller than 151 units:\n\n1. **Data Format and Consistency**: The data might come in a variety of formats, and ensuring that the height is consistently measured in the same unit (e.g., centimeters, inches) across all entries is essential. If there are inconsistencies in measurement units, they need to be standardized.\n\n2. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: There may be missing or incomplete records for some individuals, with either their height or work location not specified. Determining how to handle these cases will affect the accuracy of the final count.\n\n3. **Data Parsing Errors**: When parsing large datasets, there's always a risk of encountering parsing errors due to irregularities or unexpected data entries that don't match the general pattern.\n\n4. **PrimeKey Duplication**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, it is necessary to ensure that each person is only counted once. Care must be taken to avoid duplicate counting of individuals who appear in multiple rows.\n\n5. **Filtering by Multiple Criteria**: The task requires filtering the dataset based on two criteria—work location (HI) and a height threshold. Ensuring that the filtering logic correctly applies both conditions is crucial.\n\n6. **Data Volume**: Depending on the size of the dataset, it could be computationally intensive to process, especially if the dataset does not fit into memory and has to be processed in chunks or with the help of a database.\n\n7. **Variability in State Representation**: The state could be represented in various ways, such as 'HI', 'Hawaii', or 'hi'. It's important to account for all possible variations to correctly filter for those who work in Hawaii.\n\n8. **Non-standardized Height Entries**: Height might be entered in different formats, such as '151', '151cm', '5ft 1in', etc. Standardizing these formats would be necessary to make accurate comparisons.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we can better assess which of these potential difficulties we actually face and come up with strategies to address them."
