Inconsistent Data: There could be inconsistencies in the way data is recorded across different rows for the same person. For instance, if the height is recorded in different units (centimeters vs. inches) or if there are typographical errors.\n\n2. Duplicate Records: The same person might have more than one record, and without careful parsing, they could be counted twice.\n\n3. Missing Data: Some records might have missing data for the height or work location, making it difficult to determine if they meet the criteria.\n\n4. Ambiguous Location Data: The abbreviation \"WA\" could refer to Washington state in the USA or Western Australia in Australia, among others. Without clear context, it's hard to be certain which \"WA\" is meant.\n\n5. Data Format: The structure of the datatable needs to be understood correctly. For example, if there are multiple tables with different formats, or if the height and work location are not clearly labeled and easily distinguishable.\n\n6. Sorting and Filtering: Depending on the size of the datatable, sorting and filtering to isolate the relevant individuals (those working in WA and taller than 179) might be challenging and require careful application of conditions.\n\n7. Conversion of Units: If heights are not all in centimeters, there may be a need to convert from different units to ensure a fair comparison.\n\n8. PrimeKey Mappings: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, it's important that these are properly mapped to ensure accurate counting of individuals.\n\n9. Data Parsing Complexity: The structure of the data might be complex requiring advanced parsing techniques to accurately extract and correlate relevant information.\n\n10. Technical Limitations: The tools or software used for parsing might have limitations in handling large datasets or complex queries.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that could be faced when trying to answer the question using a datatable.
