Data Integration: If the data regarding location (TX) and height (taller than 180) are spread across different tables or files, accurately linking this information based on a common key (primeKey) would be essential.\n\n2. Inconsistencies in Data: There might be inconsistencies or errors in the data entries, such as variations in how Texas is represented (e.g., TX, Texas, Tex.). Similarly, heights might be recorded in different units or formats, complicating the comparison.\n\n3. Missing Data: Some rows might have missing information for the location or height, which would require a strategy to handle such cases.\n\n4. Data Formatting: The data might be formatted inconsistently, requiring normalization. For example, heights might be provided in meters instead of centimeters, or there could be typos.\n\n5.
