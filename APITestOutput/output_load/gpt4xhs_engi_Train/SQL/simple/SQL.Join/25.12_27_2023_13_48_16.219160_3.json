        "To determine how many people who work in Georgia (GA) are taller than 158, we need to cross-reference the height information with the location of employment. From the provided data, we see that the relevant columns are 'height' from the first table and 'location' from the second table. Also, both tables can be joined using the 'primeKey' column.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process to find the answer:\n\n1. Identify the individuals who work in GA. From the second table, that would be primeKey 'd'.\n\n2. Check the height of the individual with primeKey 'd' in the first table to see if it is greater than 158. The height for 'd' is 156.\n\nSince the employee with primeKey 'd' working in GA is 156 cm tall, which is less than 158 cm, we conclude that:\n\n**No people** who work in GA are taller than 158 cm based on the provided dataset.\n\nIt's important to note that we only consider individuals with a location of 'GA' and then check their corresponding height from the first table. In this case, there was only one person working in GA, and their height was below the specified threshold."
