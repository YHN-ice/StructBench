Filter the joined table to only include rows where the 'location' is NY.\n3. Further filter the results to only include individuals with 'height' greater than 156.\n4. Count the number of individuals that meet both criteria.\n\nLet's analyze the data provided:\n\n- Looking at the first table, we have heights for all individuals (column 'height').\n- In the second table, we have work locations (column 'location') for all individuals.\n\nJoining the tables on 'primeKey' and filtering by location and height:\n\n1.
