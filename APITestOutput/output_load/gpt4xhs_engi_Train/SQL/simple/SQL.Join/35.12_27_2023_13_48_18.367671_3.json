We'll need to ensure our parsing logic correctly applies both filters.\n\n6. **Data Size and Performance**: Depending on the size of the dataset, performance could be an issue. A large dataset might require efficient parsing and querying techniques to provide a quick response.\n\n7. **Understanding Units**: If the height is not provided in the same unit as the one mentioned in the question (e.g., inches instead of centimeters), we will need to convert all height measurements to the same unit for accurate comparison.\n\n8. **Ambiguities in Location Data**: The definition of \"work in TX\" might vary if there's no standardized format for work location (e.g., TX vs Texas vs abbreviations that may stand for other things).\n\nOnce these potential difficulties are accounted for, we can proceed with extracting and parsing the relevant data from the input file to answer the question accurately."

Therefore, according to this dataset, there are no people who work in TX who are taller than 178.\n\nTo perform this analysis, we first match the 'primeKey' to associate each individual's personal information with their employment details.
