When parsing data tables to answer the question \"How many people who work in IL are taller than 151?\", we could run into several potential difficulties and obstacles, including:\n\n1. Inconsistent Data Formats: The height data may be in different units or formats (e.g., centimeters, meters, feet and inches) requiring standardization before comparison.\n\n2. Missing Values: There may be missing or null entries for height or location, which would require decisions on how to handle these cases (e.g., exclude from count, impute values, etc.).\n\n3. Data Accuracy: The data provided might contain errors or inaccuracies that could affect the count (e.g., typos in the height or location fields).\n\n4. Data Volume: If the data set is very large, it may be computationally challenging to process the information quickly and efficiently.\n\n5. Ambiguous Location Identifiers: The abbreviation \"IL\" typically refers to Illinois, but if global data is included without clear identifiers, it might be confused with other places.\n\n6. Duplicate Entries: If the data table contains duplicate rows for the same person (same primeKey), it could lead to overcounting unless duplicates are properly managed.\n\n7. Variations in PrimeKey Representation: The primeKey which identifies a person should be consistent, but variations in its representation (e.g., different formats or leading zeroes) could complicate the identification of unique individuals.\n\n8. Multiple Rows for the Same Individual: If individuals are represented across multiple rows with the same primeKey but contain varying information, it will be necessary to consolidate this information correctly.\n\n9. Data Split Across Columns: Relevant information such as height or location might be split across multiple columns, requiring a join or merge operation to compile necessary details.\n\n10. Complex Filtering Logic: Depending on how the data is structured, extracting the subset of data for people working in IL and filtering those taller than 151 could involve complex query logic.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a careful approach to data parsing and cleaning will be essential for an accurate count.
