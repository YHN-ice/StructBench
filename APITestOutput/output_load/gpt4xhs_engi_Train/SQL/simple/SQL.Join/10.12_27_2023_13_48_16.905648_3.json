Inconsistent Data Formats: If the data concerning height or location of work is not consistently formatted, it could be challenging to parse and compare the necessary information.\n\n2. Missing Data: If any of the entries are missing information about the person's workplace or height, it might complicate the process of filtering out the relevant individuals.\n\n3. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If information about the same person is spread across multiple rows (as indicated by the primeKey), we need to ensure that we correctly aggregate this information to avoid double-counting individuals.\n\n4. Non-numeric Height Values: If height data includes units (like 'cm' or 'inches') or non-numeric characters, it would require additional parsing to extract numerical values for comparison.\n\n5. Ambiguities in Location Data: The abbreviation 'NY' may refer to New York City, New York State, or perhaps a different entity entirely. We need to make sure that 'NY' refers to the correct region and that we interpret it consistently.\n\n6. Multiple Entries for the Same Person: If a person is listed more than once with different heights or workplaces, it may be challenging to determine which entry is correct.\n\n7. Inaccurate Data: Any errors or inaccuracies in the data could lead to an incorrect count.\n\n8. Data Sorting and Filtering: Depending on the size and structure of the datatable, efficient sorting and filtering mechanisms may be needed to process the data quickly and accurately.\n\nOnce we review the datatable, we can devise strategies to overcome these obstacles and accurately answer the question."
