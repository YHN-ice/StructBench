        "Based on the input provided, we can analyze the data to determine how many people who work in NY are taller than 173 cm. From the data given, we have two individuals with `location` as NY:\n\n1. `primeKey` a: male, height 192 cm, retired, works at Twitter in NY.\n2. `primeKey` b: female, height 143 cm, unemployed, works at Apple in NY.\n\nWe are interested in individuals who work in NY and are taller than 173 cm. Looking at the heights, we can determine that:\n\n- `primeKey` a: Is taller than 173 cm (192 cm > 173 cm) and works in NY.\n- `primeKey` b: Is not taller than 173 cm (143 cm < 173 cm) and works in NY.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who work in NY and are taller than 173 cm is:\n\n**1 person** (the individual with `primeKey` a)."
