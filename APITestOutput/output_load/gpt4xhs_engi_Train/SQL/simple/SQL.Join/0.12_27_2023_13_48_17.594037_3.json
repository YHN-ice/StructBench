Missing Data: Some records might have missing information for height or state, which would require a decision on how to handle these incomplete entries.\n\n3. Multiple Records: Since the same primeKey indicates the same person, there could be multiple records for a single person. Care must be taken not to double-count individuals.\n\n4. Data Accuracy: The data provided could contain inaccuracies or typos that would lead to incorrect tallies—especially relevant if someone's height is right around the 151 cutoff.\n\n5. Data Volume: If the dataset is very large, performance considerations might come into play, requiring efficient parsing and querying methods.\n\n6. Ambiguity in Height Measurement: The provided height may not specify units, necessitating an assumption that all heights are in the same unit or a conversion if units are mixed.\n\n7. Diverse Formats of State Representation: The state may be represented by full names, abbreviations, or even misspellings, requiring standardization for accurate comparison.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these potential obstacles is crucial for accurately parsing the datatable and providing the correct number of people working in WA who are taller than 151."
