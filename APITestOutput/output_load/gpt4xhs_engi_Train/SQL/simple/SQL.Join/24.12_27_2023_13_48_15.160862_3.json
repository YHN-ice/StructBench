        "The given input consists of two linked tables with a common `primeKey`. The task is to determine how many employed people work in the state of Hawaii (HI) and are taller than 180 units (assumed to be centimeters). \n\nGiven that no state abbreviation \"HI\" is present in the `location` column of the second table and we don't have a clear indication that any of those locations abbreviate to Hawaii, there are no individuals listed as working in Hawaii. Therefore, based on the provided dataset, there are zero people who work in Hawaii and are taller than 180 cm. \n\nTo clarify, assuming that the heights listed are in centimeters (which seems to be the case since they would be implausibly short for adults if measured in inches), we can see that only one person (with primeKey 'e') has a height greater than 180 cm. However, this individual is unemployed according to the second table, so they do not meet all criteria of the question.\n\nPlease note that without an actual entry for Hawaii (HI), we cannot directly answer the question as intended. Additionally, if there were individuals working in Hawaii, we would also need to ensure that there are no duplicate counts for individuals with multiple entries."
