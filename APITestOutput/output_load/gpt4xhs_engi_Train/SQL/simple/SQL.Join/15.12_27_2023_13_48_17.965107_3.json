The `height` of the individuals: We need to identify those who have a height greater than 155.\n2. The `location` where they work: We need to ensure that they work in NY (New York).\n\nHaving isolated those two criteria in the input data, we can see that there is only one person listed with both a height greater than 155 and a location of work in NY:\n\n- Individual i (female, age 66, name t) has a height of 179 and is listed as unemployed with OPENAI in NY.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, there is 1 person who works in NY and is taller than 155. However, it's important to note that individual i is marked as \"unemployed,\" which suggests that they may not actually be working despite being associated with OPENAI in NY. If we strictly consider individuals who are employed, then the answer would be zero since individual i is not employed."
