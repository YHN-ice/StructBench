For example, is the location data just \"NY\" or is it \"New York\", or does it include full addresses that need to be parsed?\n\n5. **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring that the data is accurate is critical.

        "Based on the provided input and the structure of the datatable, we can determine how many people who work in NY are taller than 176 cm by following these steps:\n\n1. Combine the data based on the `primeKey` so that each person's work location and height are in the same record.\n   \n2. Filter the combined records to include only those whose `location` is NY.\n   \n3. Count the number of records where the `height` is greater than 176.\n\nFrom the given input tables, we can construct the following combined table:\n\n```\nprimeKey | gender | age | name | height | weight | color | status     | salary | company   | location\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na        | male   | 25  | w    | 128    | 82     | brown | retired    | 475697 | Microsoft | HI\nb        | male   | 31  | x    | 195    | 141    | brown | retired    | 389484 | OPENAI    | CA\nc        | female | 17  | y    | 188    | 150    | swarthy| unemployed| 647150 | Meta      | CA\nd        | female | 17  | z    | 201    | 134    | mulatto| retired   | 994647 | OPENAI    | CA\ne        | male   | 15  | ab   | 167    | 81     | white  | employed  | 414937 | Twitter   | CA\nf        | female | 33  | bb   | 139    | 135    | brown  | retired   | 38447  | OPENAI    | NY\ng        | male   | 53  | cb   | 157    | 103    | white  | retired   | 841222 | Twitter   | GA\n```\n\nFiltering for NY location:\n\n```\nprimeKey | gender | age | name | height | weight | color | status     | salary | company   | location\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nf        | female | 33  | bb   | 139    | 135    | brown  | retired   | 38447  | OPENAI    | NY\n```\n\nNow, from the filtered data for NY location, we can see that there is only one person (with primeKey f) who works in NY, and her height is"
