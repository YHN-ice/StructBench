Inconsistent Data Formats: The height data might be in various units (e.g., inches, centimeters) or formats (e.g., as a string with text, such as \"155 cm\"). This would require conversion or parsing to ensure accurate comparison.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some rows could have missing height or location (NY) data, which would need to be accounted for or handled appropriately.\n\n3. Data Spanning Multiple Tables: If the data is in multiple tables, we may need to join these tables on a common key (primeKey) to get a complete picture of each person's attributes.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: There could be duplicate entries for the same person (same primeKey) with conflicting data, which would require deduplication or reconciliation of the data.\n\n5. Ambiguous Location Data: The abbreviation \"NY\" could refer to New York City or New York State. If location data is not standardized, it might take additional effort to ensure that we're only considering people who work specifically in the area referred to by \"NY.\"\n\n6. Differentiating Between Current and Past Work Locations: If the dataset includes historical work locations, we may need to determine which location is the current one.\n\n7. Data Errors: There could be errors in the dataset, such as typos or incorrect entries, which might lead to inaccurate counts if not identified and corrected.\n\n8. Data Access and Permissions: Depending on the system storing the data, we may need appropriate access rights to query or process the information.\n\n9. Performance and Efficiency: If the dataset is very large, querying and processing it to find the count of people might require efficient algorithms and possibly optimizations to run within acceptable time frames.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles can help in developing a strategy to accurately parse and analyze the datatable information, ensuring a correct answer is provided."
