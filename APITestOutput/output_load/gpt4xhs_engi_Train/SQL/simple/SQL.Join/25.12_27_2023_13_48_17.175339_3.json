However, there are a few issues:\n\n1. The datatable does not include the state \"HI\" for any of the company locations; it includes \"NY\" and \"WA\" locations instead.\n2. The height criteria can be assessed, but without the correct location data (specifically for Hawaii), we cannot accurately answer the question as it is stated.\n\nConsidering the information given, we can still identify the number of people who are taller than 159 cm; however, none of them are listed as working in Hawaii based on the provided data.\n\nHere's how we can process the given data:\n\n1. We look at the 'height' column and count all the entries with a height greater than 159 cm.\n2. We then cross-reference these entries with their 'location' to check if any are in Hawaii.\n\nAccording to the data provided:\n\n- Person a: Height is 174 cm, but location is NY.\n- Person b: Height is 183 cm, but location is WA.\n- Person c: Height is 210 cm, but location is NY.\n- Person d: Height is 201 cm, but location is WA.\n- Person e: Height is 147 cm, which does not meet the height criteria.\n- Person f: Height is 202 cm, but location is NY.\n\nBased on the above, we can determine that there are 4 people (Person a, b, c, and d) who are taller than 159 cm, but none of them work in HI based on the location data provided.
