We would need to normalize these to ensure we correctly identify all individuals working in NY.\n\n5. **Data Spread Across Rows**: If relevant information about an individual (such as height and work location) is spread across multiple rows with the same primeKey, we’d have to piece together this information for each individual before we can determine if they meet the criteria.\n\n6. **Potential for Ambiguous Location**: The workplace location may not always directly indicate 'NY' as it could be an area code, a district name, or an abbreviated company address that implies the individual works in NY.\n\n7. **Data Volume and Performance**: If the datatable is very large, the performance of parsing and filtering operations could become an issue, necessitating efficient data processing techniques to handle the dataset effectively.\n\n8. **Error-Prone Data Entry**: Typos, misspellings, or inconsistent capitalization in the datatable entries could complicate the identification process.\n\n9. **Merged Cells or Complex Structures**: Depending on how the datatable is formatted (e.g., merged cells or hierarchical structures), extracting the necessary information could require additional parsing logic.\n\n10. **Privacy Constraints**: There may be privacy rules that restrict the use of personal data such as height and work location, though this is less of a technical difficulty and more of a legal/ethical consideration when handling real datasets.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these challenges will be crucial to providing an accurate count of individuals who meet both criteria: working in NY and being taller than 176"
