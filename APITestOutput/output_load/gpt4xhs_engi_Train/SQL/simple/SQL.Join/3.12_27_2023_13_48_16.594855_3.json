For example, TX might be written as Texas or Tx, which would require normalization to ensure all relevant data is considered.\n\n4. **Duplicate Entries**: If the same person (with the same primeKey) has multiple entries with different information, it’s important to determine which entry is correct or if they need to be combined.\n\n5. **Data Volume**: A large dataset could pose performance issues depending on the method or tool used for parsing and analyzing the data.\n\n6. **Parsing Errors**: There could be errors in parsing the datatable due to irregularities or unexpected formats within the data.\n\n7. **Variations in Height Measurement**: Heights might be listed in centimeters or meters, and a conversion might be necessary to ensure all heights are compared using the same unit of measurement.\n\n8. **Filtering Complexity**: The criteria involve two filters – location and height.
