        "Based on the provided input and focusing on the relevant factors mentioned, we can determine how many people who work in Illinois (IL) are taller than 164 cm. To do this, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Match the `primeKey` with the corresponding `location` to find all individuals who work in IL.\n2. From the matched individuals, check their `height` to see if it is greater than 164.\n3. Count the number of individuals who satisfy both conditions.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given data:\n\n1. Individuals working in IL: b, h\n   - Using primeKey `b` and `h`, we match them to their other attributes.\n   \n| primeKey | gender | age | name | height | weight | color  |\n|----------|--------|-----|------|--------|--------|--------|\n| b        | male   | 18  | n    | 171    | 118    | mulatto |\n| h        | male   | 65  | t    | 159    | 90     | olive   |\n\n2.
