        "I understand the potential issues that could arise from parsing and analyzing the data. Based on the information provided, we can proceed with the assumption that all heights are in the same unit, the data is well-formatted, there are no missing records for height, the data is free from input errors, there are no duplicate records, and that \"HI\" is not a relevant location code but rather part of the question asking how many people working in any state are taller than 167 units (presumably centimeters).\n\nThe dataset is split into two parts based on the provided input.
