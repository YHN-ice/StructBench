        "To answer the question, we need to focus on two key pieces of information: the individuals' heights and their work location. From the dataset provided, we can see that it is split across two tables, which are linked by the 'primeKey' column.

Merge the two tables on the 'primeKey' so that we have a single table with all required information per individual.\n\n2. Filter the merged table to include only entries with 'location' as 'HI' to isolate those who work in Hawaii (HI).\n\n3. From the filtered entries, count how many have a 'height' greater than 177.\n\nBased on the input data you've given, let's perform these steps:\n\n1. Merge:\n   We combine the two tables using the 'primeKey', resulting in a table where each person's employment information is aligned with their personal characteristics.\n\n2. Filter for HI location:\n   From the combined table, we select only those rows where the 'location' column is 'HI'.\n\n3. Count height > 177:\n   From the filtered data, we count entries where the 'height' column has a value greater than 177.\n\nLooking at the provided data and filtering for those who work in HI, we have:\n\nb (unemployed, OPENAI, HI) with a height of 138\ng (employed, Apple, HI) with a height of 130\ni (unemployed, OPENAI, HI) with a height of 188\n\nAmong these individuals, only 'i' has a height greater than 177.
