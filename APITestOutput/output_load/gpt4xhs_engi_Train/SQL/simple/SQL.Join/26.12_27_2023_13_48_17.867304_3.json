We need to clarify whether people who are exactly 156 cm tall should be included in the count.\n\n6. **Identification of Relevant Columns:** The datatable needs to be parsed to correctly identify which columns correspond to the location (CA for California) and height.\n\n7. **Data Volume:** If the datatable is very large, it may present computational challenges in processing the data efficiently.\n\n8. **Data Type Conversion:** Heights may need to be converted into a numeric format if they aren't already, which could be complicated by mixed formats within the data.\n\nOnce provided with the datatable, these potential difficulties will need to be addressed to ensure a correct and efficient parsing process to answer the question accurately."
