If the units are not consistent, they will need to be converted to a common unit before making comparisons.\n\n4. **Matching primeKey**: Since the same `primeKey` refers to the same person, information could be spread across multiple rows. This will require consolidating information by `primeKey` to ensure we have complete information for each individual.\n\n5. **Data Size**: If the dataset is very large, it could be computationally intensive to process and filter the data to identify individuals who meet the criteria.\n\n6. **Ambiguous State Abbreviations**: There might be confusion with state abbreviations if they are not standardized (e.g., IL could stand for Illinois or could be a typo for another state abbreviation).\n\n7. **Data Format**: The file format of the input data can pose challenges if it's not in a format that is easily readable or parseable.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: The data might contain errors or outliers that don't make sense (such as a height of 1500 cm), which would need to be handled appropriately.\n\n9. **Case Sensitivity**: The state information could be case-sensitive. For example, 'il' and 'IL' should be treated as the same state.\n\n10. **Partial Records**: If some records are partial or split across multiple lines, it would require additional logic to assemble them correctly before analysis.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these potential issues is crucial in preparing to parse the datatables accurately."
