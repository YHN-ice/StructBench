        "Given the provided data and the task to count the number of people who work in WA and are taller than 168 cm, we will need to first filter the data based on the 'location' and 'height' criteria. We must consider only those records that have a 'location' value of 'WA' and a 'height' value greater than 168.\n\nFrom the given input, we see two tables with associated keys. To determine who works in WA, we need to look at the second table with the 'location' column. Once we identify those individuals, we can cross-reference their 'primeKey' with the first table to check their heights.\n\nLet's evaluate the 'location' and 'height' for each applicable individual:\n\n1. Row with primeKey 'a':\n   - Location: GA\n   - Height: 181\n   - Not counted because the location is not WA.\n\n2. Row with primeKey 'b':\n   - Location: CA\n   - Height: 169\n   - Not counted because the location is not WA.\n\n3. Row with primeKey 'c':\n   - Location: HI\n   - Height: 210\n   - Not counted because the location is not WA.\n\n4. Row with primeKey 'd':\n   - Location: WA\n   - Height: 142\n   - Not counted because although the location is WA, the height is less than 168.\n\n5. Row with primeKey 'e':\n   - Location: TX\n   - Height: 218\n   - Not counted because the location is not WA.\n\n6. Row with primeKey 'f':\n   - Location: GA\n   - Height: 146\n   - Not counted because the location is not WA.\n\n7. Row with primeKey 'g':\n   - Location: TX\n   - Height: 152\n   - Not counted because the location is not WA.\n\n8. Row with primeKey 'h':\n   - Location: HI\n   - Height: 183\n   - Not counted because the location is not WA.\n\n9. Row with primeKey 'i':\n   - Location: WA\n   - Height: 191\n   - Counted because both the location is WA, and the height is greater than 168.\n\nBased on these checks, there is only one person (with primeKey 'i') who works in WA and is taller than 168 cm. Therefore, the answer is one person."
