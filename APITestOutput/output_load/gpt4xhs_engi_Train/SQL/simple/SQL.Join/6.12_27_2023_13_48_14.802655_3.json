Matching Prime Keys: Since the same prime key refers to the same person, the parser must correctly associate data across rows that may be non-adjacent in the dataset.\n\n4. Unit Differences: Height could be recorded in different units (e.g., centimeters vs. inches). If not standardized, converting to a common unit will be necessary.\n\n5. Ambiguous Location Identifiers: The abbreviation \"GA\" must be unambiguously identified as the state of Georgia.

        "Based on the input provided, it looks like we're dealing with two separate tables that are linked by a common 'primeKey'.

Filter the remaining data for 'height' greater than 169.\n\nUsing this approach on the dataset given:\n\n- Only one person ('c') has a height greater than 169.\n- This person ('c') is listed as retired in TX.\n\nTherefore, if the question were about Texas, the answer would be one person who is retired and meets the height criteria.
