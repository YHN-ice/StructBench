Personal information including `primeKey`, `gender`, `age`, `name`, `height`, `weight`, `color`.\n2. Employment information including `primeKey`, `status`, `salary`, `company`, `location`.\n\nFirst, let's identify the individuals who are taller than 156:\n- Person with primeKey 'a': height 160\n- Person with primeKey 'c': height 207\n- Person with primeKey 'd': height 164\n\nNow, let's match these individuals with their employment information using the `primeKey`:\n- Person 'a' works for NVIDIA in TX.\n- Person 'c' is unemployed.\n- Person 'd' works for Google in NY.\n\nGiven that none of these employees work in HI (Hawaii), the result is that there are 0 people who work in HI and are taller than 156, based on the provided data."
