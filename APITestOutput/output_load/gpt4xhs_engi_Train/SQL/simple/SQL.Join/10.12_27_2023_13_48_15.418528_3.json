Multiple Entries for Individuals: If the same person has multiple rows with different information, we need to ensure that each individual is only counted once.\n\n3. Unstructured Data: If the data is not formatted in a consistent and structured manner, it might require additional processing to extract relevant information.\n\n4. Complex File Formats: If the data is within a complex file format that requires specific software or libraries to parse, it might be necessary to use specialized tools.\n\n5. Ambiguous Height Measurement: If the height is not clearly specified as being in centimeters, we must confirm the unit of measurement to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. Misinterpretation of \"HI\": We must ensure that \"HI\" refers to the state of Hawaii and not another entity (like a company or organization with the initials \"HI\").\n\n7. Potential Errors in Data: Typos, erroneous values, or formatting issues could lead to incorrect assessments.\n\n8. Performance Considerations: Depending on the size of the dataset, we may need efficient parsing algorithms to handle large amounts of data without significant delays or resource consumption.\n\n9.

Check the height of those employees to see who is taller than 150 cm.\n\nHowever, after matching the `primeKey` with the locations and examining the dataset provided, we see that none of the employees work in Hawaii (HI); we have only TX and GA as locations. Therefore, there is no data to answer the question since no one is listed as working in Hawaii.\n\nIf we were to disregard the location and simply look at who is taller than 150 cm in the data provided, we have two individuals based on the height column:\n- Individual with `primeKey` a has a height of 215.\n- Individual with `primeKey` b has a height of 151.\n\nBoth of these individuals are taller than 150 cm. However, since none of these entries are for employees in Hawaii (HI), according to the location requirement of your question, the answer would be zero.
