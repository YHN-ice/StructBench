We must make sure that for each person's primary key ('primeKey'), we only count them once.\n\nFrom the input data, we have one person with the location 'IL', which is person 'h'. Now, we need to check if person 'h's height is greater than 170 cm.\n\nPerson 'h' is 181 cm tall, which is greater than 170 cm.
