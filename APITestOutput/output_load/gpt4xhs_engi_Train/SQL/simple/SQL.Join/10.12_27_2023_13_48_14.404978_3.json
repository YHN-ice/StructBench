This would require conversion to a consistent unit for comparison.\n\n2. Missing Data: There may be missing height data for some individuals, which could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n3. Data Spread Across Multiple Tables: If the data about where people work and their heights are spread across different tables, they must be accurately joined using the primeKey (assuming it's the unique identifier) to ensure that we are correlating the correct information for each individual.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: It is possible that there are duplicate entries for some individuals (same primeKey), which could lead to counting some people more than once if not handled properly.\n\n5. Error in Data: Typos or incorrect data entry can lead to inaccuracies in height measurements or work locations.\n\n6. Ambiguous Location Names: \"NY\" could refer to New York City, New York State, or even potentially be a typo for another abbreviation. We need to make sure we understand the context correctly.\n\n7.

Check location ('NY') and employment status (to ensure they are not 'unemployed' or 'retired').\n2. Check height (must be greater than '179').\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given input data:\n\n- Person with primeKey 'a' is unemployed, so they don't count.\n- Person with primeKey 'b' is unemployed in NY, but their height is only '133', so they don't count.\n- Person with primeKey 'c' is unemployed in GA, so they don't count.\n- Person with primeKey 'd' is retired in GA, so they don't count.\n- Person with primeKey 'e' is employed but in CA, so they don't count.\n- Person with primeKey 'f' is employed in GA, so they don't count.\n- Person with primeKey 'g' is employed in TX, so they don't count.\n- Person with primeKey 'h' is employed in WA, so they don't count.\n- Person with primeKey 'i' is retired in NY and their height is '189', which is greater than '179'.\n\nBased on the criteria, there is only 1 person (with primeKey 'i') who works in NY and is taller than 179 cm."
