We need to confirm that the heights are in a consistent unit and convert them if necessary to compare against the 179-unit threshold.\n\n4.

Merging Data from Different Tables: If the information about height and work location is spread across different tables linked by a primeKey, we will need to join these tables accurately by primeKey to assess both criteria for each individual.\n\n6.
