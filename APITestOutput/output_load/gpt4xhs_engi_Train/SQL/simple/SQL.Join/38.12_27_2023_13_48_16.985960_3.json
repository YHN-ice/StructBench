Missing Data: Some rows might have missing data for the work location (TX) or height, which would require careful handling to avoid counting inaccuracies.\n\n3. Data Spread Across Rows: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, height information and work location might be on separate rows. We would need to correctly associate these rows with each other to get accurate data for each individual.\n\n4. Data Integrity Issues: There may be errors or inconsistencies in the data itself, such as typos or incorrect values, which could lead to incorrect tallies.\n\n5. Duplicates: The dataset might contain duplicate records for some individuals that would need to be identified and removed to prevent overcounting.\n\n6. Large Dataset: If the datatable is very large, it could pose performance issues, requiring efficient parsing and querying techniques to handle the data effectively.\n\n7. Non-standard Units: Heights could be recorded in various units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches), necessitating a conversion to a common unit for comparison.\n\n8.
