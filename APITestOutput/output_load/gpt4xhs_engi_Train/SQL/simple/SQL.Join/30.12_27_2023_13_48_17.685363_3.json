However, without seeing the actual data, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might occur:\n\n1. **Data Format Consistency**: If the data regarding height is not consistently formatted (e.g., some entries in centimeters and others in inches), this could cause inaccuracies in determining who is taller than 170.\n\n2. **Missing Data**: If some rows are missing key pieces of information, such as the work location or height, it will be challenging to accurately count the number of people who meet both criteria.\n\n3. **Data Entry Errors**: Typos or incorrect data entries could lead to misclassifying individuals either in terms of their work location or their height.\n\n4. **Non-unique primeKey**: If the primeKey is not unique and does not reliably identify individuals, there may be duplicate data or confusion about how many distinct individuals are present in the dataset.\n\n5. **Complex Data Structures**: If the data is spread across multiple tables or files and needs to be joined using the primeKey, this could complicate the parsing process.\n\n6. **Data Parsing and Processing Limitations**: Depending on the size of the dataset and the capabilities of the parser (e.g., processing power, memory limits), handling a large amount of data could pose technical challenges.\n\n7. **Ambiguities in Location Codes**: The abbreviation \"HI\" must clearly refer to Hawaii for accurate counting. If there are ambiguities in location codes or multiple locations with similar codes, this could lead to errors.\n\n8. **Handling Multiple Data Types**: The dataset might contain numerical data (for height) as well as categorical data (for work location). Ensuring correct operations on each type is essential for accurate results.\n\nUnderstanding how these potential difficulties could impact the parsing process will help in preparing to mitigate them when analyzing the actual datatable."
