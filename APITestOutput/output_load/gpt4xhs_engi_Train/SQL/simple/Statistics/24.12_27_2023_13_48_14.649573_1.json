Incorrect or missing salary data could lead to an inaccurate count of the number of people earning above the specified threshold.\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries:** If the data table has duplicate entries for the same person, we need to ensure that each individual is only counted once, regardless of how many times their information appears.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues:** Salaries need to be in a numerical format that allows for comparison operations. If salaries are provided as strings or contain non-numeric characters, additional parsing might be required to convert them into a comparable numerical form.\n\n5. **Large Datasets:** Handling a very large dataset might result in performance issues, depending on the resources available and the efficiency of the parsing algorithm.\n\n6. **PrimeKey Identification:** The rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, so it's important to correctly identify and use the primeKey to avoid inaccuracies in the count.\n\n7. **Salary Threshold Precision:** Ensuring that the comparison operation against the salary value of 921894 is precise and accurate to avoid any off-by-one errors or rounding issues. \n\nOnce provided with the input file, these potential difficulties would need to be addressed to accurately determine the number of people with salaries greater than the specified amount."
