        "Based on the input provided, we need to analyze the data and count the number of people who have a salary greater than 890775.

It's important to ensure that the rows from both sections correspond to each other via the `primeKey`.\n\nNow, let's count the number of people with a salary greater than 890775:\n\n1. Person with primeKey 'a': Salary is 789205, which is less than 890775.\n2. Person with primeKey 'b': Salary is 329660, which is less than 890775.\n3.
