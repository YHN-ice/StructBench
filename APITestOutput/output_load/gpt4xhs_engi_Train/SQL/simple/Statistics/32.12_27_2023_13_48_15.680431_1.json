If salaries are recorded in different currencies or formats, it may be necessary to normalize them to be able to compare the values accurately.\n\n3. **Data Type Issues**: Salaries should be stored as numerical values. However, if they are stored as strings or contain formatting characters (such as commas, currency symbols, etc.), they will need to be cleaned and converted to numerical types before comparisons can be made.\n\n4. **Missing or Incorrect Data**: There may be missing or incorrect salary data in the dataset, which would affect the accuracy of the count.\n\n5. **Large Datasets**: If the dataset is very large, there may be performance concerns when processing the data to count the number of people with salaries above the specified amount.\n\n6. **Sorting and Filtering**: It may be necessary to sort and filter the data effectively to isolate only those rows that match the salary condition specified.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: The parser must be robust enough to handle any anomalies or errors in the data without crashing or providing incorrect counts.\n\n8. **Data Privacy and Security**: When dealing with sensitive information such as salaries, it is important to ensure that data privacy and security protocols are followed.\n\nOnce I view the input file, I can address these issues specifically based on the actual content and structure of the provided datatable."
