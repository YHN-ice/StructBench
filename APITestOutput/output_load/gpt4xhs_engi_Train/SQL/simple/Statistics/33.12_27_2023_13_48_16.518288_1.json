        "Based on the input provided, we must determine the number of people who have a salary greater than 358,691. To do so, we will consider only those individuals who are marked as 'employed,' 'retired,' or have any other status indicating that they receive a salary, while ignoring those labeled as 'unemployed' since they do not have a salary.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Create a mapping of `primeKey` to `salary` from the second table for individuals with a status other than 'unemployed'.\n2. Filter out the salaries from this mapping that are greater than 358,691.\n3. Count the number of such instances.\n\nBased on the data provided in the input, let's do this step by step:\n\nFrom the second table, we extract the following key-salary pairs (excluding those who are unemployed):\n\n- b: 659355\n- c: 306453\n- d: 693863\n- f: 428257\n- g: 370692\n- h: 275472\n\nNow let's count the salaries greater than 358,691:\n\n- b: 659355 (greater than 358,691)\n- d: 693863 (greater than 358,691)\n- f: 428257 (greater than 358,691)\n- g: 370692 (greater than 358,691)\n\nThe salaries for c and h are not greater than 358,691, so we do not count them.\n\nCounting the ones that are greater gives us a total of 4 people who have a salary more than 358,691."
