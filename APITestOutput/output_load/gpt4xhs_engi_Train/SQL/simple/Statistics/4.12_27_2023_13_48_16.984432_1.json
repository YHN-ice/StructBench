        "To answer the question, we need to count the number of people who have a salary greater than 22648. From the given input data, we can see that each person is represented by a unique `primeKey`, and their salary is listed in the second part of the input table.\n\nTo simplify the process and avoid potential difficulties and obstacles, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Review the data to ensure that each `primeKey` is unique and there are no multiple entries for the same individual.\n2. Check that the salary is represented in a consistent numerical format without currency symbols or commas.\n3. Make sure there are no missing or incomplete salary data entries for any individuals.\n4. Count the number of people whose salary exceeds 22648.\n\nBased on the provided data snippet, we'll count the number of salaries above 22648:\n\n- primeKey 'a' has a salary of 362271, which is more than 22648.\n- primeKey 'b' has a salary of 269131, which is more than 22648.\n- primeKey 'c' has a salary of 419694, which is more than 22648.\n- primeKey 'd' has a salary of 509156, which is more than 22648.\n- primeKey 'e' has a salary of 470174, which is more than 22648.\n- primeKey 'f' has a salary of 548570, which is more than 22648.\n- primeKey 'g' has a salary of 171673, which is more than 22648.\n- primeKey 'h' has a salary of 72850, which is less than 22648, so we do not count it.\n- primeKey 'i' has a salary of 338629, which is more than 22648.\n- primeKey 'j' has a salary of 35290, which is more than 22648.\n\nNow counting the number of people with salaries above 22648, we get: 9 individuals.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 people with salaries greater than 22648."
