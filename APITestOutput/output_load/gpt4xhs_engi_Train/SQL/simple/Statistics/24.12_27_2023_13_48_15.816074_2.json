Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, duplicates must be identified and counted only once.\n\n4. **Ambiguous Gender Indicators:** There might be ambiguous indicators of gender that are not clearly male or female, such as initials or non-binary gender representations.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity:** Gender data might be case-sensitive, with entries like \"female,\" \"Female,\" and \"FEMALE\" all referring to the same gender but needing to be accounted for without causing discrepancies.\n\n6. **Data Errors:** The dataset may contain errors or typos in the gender field that could lead to incorrect classification if not properly cleaned or accounted for.\n\n7. **Language Variations:** The dataset might include gender representations in different languages, which would require additional logic to interpret correctly.\n\n8. **Non-Standard Columns:** If the dataset does not have a dedicated gender column or has it labeled in a non-standard way, identifying the correct column to parse could be an issue.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization of gender representations, deduplication based on primeKey, and careful handling of missing or ambiguous data would be necessary before accurately counting the number of females in the dataset."
