We need to ensure we count each person only once.\n\n3. **Data Types**: The data might not be in a numeric format that allows for easy comparison.

Efficient parsing and comparison methods might be necessary.\n\n5. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: There may be rows with missing or incomplete salary data, which would need to be handled correctly to avoid counting errors.\n\n6. **Erroneous Data**: There could be errors in the data (e.g., unrealistically high or low salaries) that could skew the results if not handled properly.\n\n7. **Data Access**: Depending on the format of the input (e.g., a file on disk, a database, an API response), accessing the data might present its own challenges.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can proceed to identify and address these challenges to accurately count the number of people with a salary greater than 575297."
