Data formatting: Salaries might be expressed in different formats. For instance, some may include commas, currency symbols, or even be in a different currency, which requires standardization for proper comparison.\n\n3. Incomplete data: Some rows might have missing data for salaries, which would require a decision on how to handle such cases—whether to exclude them from the count or make an assumption based on available information.\n\n4.

Large dataset: If the dataset is very large, efficient parsing and filtering methods will be needed to handle the data without running into performance issues.\n\n6. Data accuracy: The dataset might contain errors or inaccuracies which can mislead the analysis. It's important to ensure that salary data is reliable.\n\n7.
