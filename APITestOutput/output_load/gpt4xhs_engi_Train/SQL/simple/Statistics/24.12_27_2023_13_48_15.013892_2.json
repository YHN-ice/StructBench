Missing Data: Some rows might have missing gender information, leading to an undercount if not handled properly.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: The same individual might be listed multiple times in the datatable. Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, it's important to ensure that each individual is only counted once regardless of how many times they appear.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: If the data uses ambiguous or non-traditional indicators for gender, it might be challenging to categorize individuals correctly.\n\n5. Data Size and Performance: If the datatable is very large, performance could be a concern, and efficient parsing methods would be needed to count the number of females.\n\n6. Data Errors: There could be typographical or data entry errors in the gender field that could lead to misclassification.\n\n7. Multiple Data Tables: If the information is spread across multiple tables, ensuring all relevant data is considered when counting may be challenging.\n\n8. Variation in PrimeKey: If the primeKey field itself has inconsistencies (e.g., leading zeros or different formats), it might be challenging to correctly identify unique individuals.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to implement strategies such as data cleaning, deduplication based on primeKey, and standardization of gender identifiers before we could accurately determine the number of females in the dataset."
