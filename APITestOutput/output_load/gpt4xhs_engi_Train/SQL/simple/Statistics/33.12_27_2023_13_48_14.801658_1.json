Additionally, if the file contains corrupted or inconsistent data, it may lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **Distinguishing Unique Individuals:** If the datatable contains multiple rows for the same individual (as indicated by a primeKey), we need to ensure that we only count each person once, even if their information is spread across multiple rows.\n\n3. **Data Type Issues:** Ensuring that the salary values are interpreted as numerical data rather than strings is crucial. If not handled correctly, we may end up comparing strings instead of numbers, which will lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Large Dataset Handling:** If the dataset is exceptionally large, it may require efficient parsing techniques to process the data without running into performance issues.\n\n5. **Salary Data Accessibility:** The data table needs to have a clear and consistent column where salary information is stored. If the salary data is not clearly labeled or if it's stored in an unconventional format, it might be more difficult to extract and compare.\n\n6. **Data Filtering:** We need to implement a filtering mechanism to identify individuals with salaries above the specified threshold.\n\n7. **Missing or Incomplete Data:** There might be missing values or incomplete records for salaries. We need to decide how to handle such cases – whether to ignore them or treat them as below the threshold.\n\n8. **Formatting Variance:** Salaries might be formatted differently (e.g., including currency symbols, commas, decimal points) which will require normalization before comparison.\n\nOnce we understand the input file structure and content, we can address these challenges accordingly to provide an accurate count of people with salaries above 100289."
