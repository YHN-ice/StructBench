If salaries are represented in various currencies or include non-numeric characters, it might require preprocessing.\n\n4. **Missing Data**: If there are missing or null values in the salary column, a method to handle these entries must be decided upon.\n\n5. **Large Datasets**: If the datatable is very large, efficiency may become an issue and could require optimized parsing techniques.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structures**: If the datatable is provided in a complex or nested data structure, additional steps may be needed to extract the relevant information.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I can apply the necessary parsing logic while keeping these potential challenges in mind."

        "Based on the provided input data, which seems to be a structured table with two sections, we want to identify the number of people who have a salary greater than 341731. The input seems to be a combination of personal details and employment details, connected by a 'primeKey'.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to focus on the second section of the provided table which contains the 'salary' information. Here's a breakdown of the relevant entries:\n\n- Person 'a' has a salary of 6593 (unemployed, but still a recorded salary, possibly a mistake or past salary).\n- Person 'b' has a salary of 8683 (employed).\n- Person 'c' has a salary of 878698 (retired).\n- Person 'd' has a salary of 750141 (retired).\n\nNow let's count the number of people with a salary greater than 341731:\n\n- Person 'c' has a salary of 878698, which is greater than 341731.\n- Person 'd' has a salary of 750141, which is also greater than 341731.\n\nSo, there are two people (person 'c' and person 'd') who have a salary greater than 341731.\n\nAnswer: 2 people work with a salary more than 341731."
