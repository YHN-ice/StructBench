Different representations will require normalization for accurate counting.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some rows may have missing gender information, making it uncertain whether the person is male, female, or another gender.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: The same person might be represented multiple times in the datatable. If the primeKey is not used correctly to identify unique individuals, duplicates could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: Some entries might use non-standard or ambiguous terms to indicate gender, which would need interpretation or additional context to classify correctly.\n\n5. Data Split Across Multiple Rows: If the datatable uses multiple rows to store information about the same person (as indicated by the primeKey), it's necessary to ensure that all rows associated with an individual are considered before determining their gender.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: The datatable may have case-sensitive entries, and if the parsing is not done in a case-insensitive manner, it might lead to miscounting.\n\n7. Large Datasets: If the dataset is particularly large, computational efficiency may become a concern, necessitating more efficient parsing and counting algorithms.\n\n8.
