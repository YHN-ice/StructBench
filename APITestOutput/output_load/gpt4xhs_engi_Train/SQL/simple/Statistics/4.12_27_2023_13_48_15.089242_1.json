So we will exclude primeKey c and primeKey e from this count because one is unemployed and the other is retired.\n\nNow, let's count the number of employed individuals with a salary above 135277:\n\n- primeKey a: 142684 (> 135277)\n- primeKey b: 238179 (> 135277)\n- primeKey d: 953819 (> 135277)\n\nTherefore, there are **3 people** who are employed with a salary more than 135277 according to the given data."
