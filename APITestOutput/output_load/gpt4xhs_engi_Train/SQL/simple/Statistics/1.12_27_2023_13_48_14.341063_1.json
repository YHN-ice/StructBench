Parsing this correctly to compare against a numerical threshold would be essential.\n\n6. **Sorting and Filtering Efficiency**: Depending on the size of the data and the computational resources available, sorting and filtering operations to isolate the relevant dataset (those earning more than 115435) might be resource-intensive.\n\n7. **Human Error**: Manual oversight in interpreting the data or coding errors in the script used for parsing could lead to incorrect answers.\n\n8. **Currency and Regional Differences**: If the salaries are provided in different currencies or if regional differences (such as tax codes or cost of living adjustments) need to be considered, converting them to a standard format could pose a challenge.\n\n9. **Confidentiality and Data Privacy**: Salaries are sensitive information.
