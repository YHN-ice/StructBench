For instance, salaries could be formatted with commas, periods, or even as text (e.g., \"nine hundred seventy thousand six hundred twenty\").\n\n3. **Data Splitting:** The relevant information about salaries may be split across multiple rows or columns, which means the parser needs to correctly reassemble this information for accurate analysis.\n\n4. **Duplicates or Errors:** The datatable might contain duplicate records for individuals or erroneous data that could lead to incorrect counts unless properly identified and handled.\n\n5. **Missing Data:** Some rows could have missing salary information, which would need to be accounted for when tallying the count.\n\n6. **Data Type Issues:** Salaries might not be stored as numerical values, requiring conversion or special handling to perform comparisons.\n\n7. **Multiple Currencies:** If the datatable includes international data, salaries could be in different currencies and would need conversion to a single standard for proper comparison.\n\n8. **Privacy Constraints:** Depending on the context, there might be privacy regulations that restrict how much salary data can be processed or shared.\n\n9. **Performance Efficiency:** The algorithm or method used to parse the datatable must be efficient to ensure a timely response, particularly if the dataset is large or if the question needs to be answered multiple times with different thresholds.\n\n10. **PrimeKey Matching:** Since the same primeKey refers to the same person, ensuring that salaries are not counted multiple times for individuals with multiple records is crucial.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these potential issues will be important in accurately parsing the datatable and providing the correct count of people with salaries above the specified threshold."
