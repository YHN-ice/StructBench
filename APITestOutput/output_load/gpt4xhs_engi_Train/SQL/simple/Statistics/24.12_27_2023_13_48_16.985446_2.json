Duplicate Records: The same person might be listed multiple times with different primeKeys due to data entry errors. This would require a method to identify and remove duplicates.\n\n4. Data Size: If the datatable is very large, it might be difficult to process all the information manually, and an automated method would be required.\n\n5. Ambiguous Gender Representation: The datatable might include non-binary or transgender individuals who do not identify strictly as female, which could complicate the categorization process.\n\n6. Privacy Settings: There might be privacy settings that restrict access to gender information, limiting the ability to count the number of females in the dataset.\n\n7.
