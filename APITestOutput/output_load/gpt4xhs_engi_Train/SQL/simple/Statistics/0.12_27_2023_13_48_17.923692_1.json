Data accuracy: The datatable might contain inaccuracies or inconsistencies (such as typing errors or outdated information) that could lead to incorrect results if not properly validated or cleaned.\n\n4. Multiple entries per person: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there might be multiple entries for individuals, which could complicate the process of determining unique salaries.\n\n5. Ambiguity in salary definition: The term \"salary\" might include various components such as base salary, bonuses, and other compensation. We need clarity on whether to consider total compensation or just the base salary.\n\n6. Data sorting and filtering: We will need to sort and filter data effectively to isolate those with salaries above the specified threshold.\n\n7. Data privacy and security: Depending on the sensitivity of the salary information, there might be privacy concerns that limit access to the data or require careful handling.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we'll need to carefully examine the input file's format, ensure data accuracy, account for multiple entries per person correctly, and use appropriate data processing techniques."
