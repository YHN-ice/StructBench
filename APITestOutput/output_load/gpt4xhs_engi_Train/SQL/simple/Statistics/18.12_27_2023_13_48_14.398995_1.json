        "Based on the input provided, we can see that the data is structured with the primeKey linking personal information (such as gender, age, name, height, weight, color) to employment information (including status, salary, company, location). To determine the number of people with a salary greater than 590824, we need to look at the salary column in the employment information section.\n\nHere are the salaries listed:\n\n- a: 427595 (unemployed, therefore not counted)\n- b: 270744 (unemployed, therefore not counted)\n- c: 702217\n- d: 904088 (retired, but since retirement is a status and not indicating absence of salary, this should be counted)\n- e: 648253\n- f: 555572 (employed, but salary is less than the threshold)\n- g: 359224 (employed, but salary is less than the threshold)\n- h: 577831\n- i: 127188 (retired, but salary is less than the threshold)\n\nThe individuals with salaries greater than 590824 are:\n- c\n- d\n- e\n- h\n\nTherefore, there are 4 people who work with a salary more than 590824.\n\nNote: In this context, \"unemployed\" and \"retired\" are considered statuses, but it's not clear if \"unemployed\" means not earning a salary. For the purpose of this answer, I included \"retired\" individuals if their salary met the threshold since retirement does not necessarily mean not having an income. However, \"unemployed\" individuals were not counted as working and hence their salaries were not considered. If different assumptions are needed (e.g., including high salaries for unemployed individuals or excluding retired individuals), the count may change accordingly."
