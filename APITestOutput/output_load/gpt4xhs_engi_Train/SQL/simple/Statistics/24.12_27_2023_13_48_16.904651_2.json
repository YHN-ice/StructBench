Large Dataset: If the dataset is quite large, performance considerations might come into play when parsing and analyzing the data.\n\n6. Complex Data Structures: The data might be structured in a complex manner that is not straightforward to parse, such as nested JSON objects, XML with multiple levels, or unconventional delimiters in a CSV file.\n\n7.
