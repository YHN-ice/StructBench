Inconsistent Data: The gender information might not be consistently labeled across the dataset. For example, some entries may use \"F\" for female, while others use \"female,\" \"woman,\" or other variations.\n\n2. Missing Data: There could be missing gender data for some of the entries, which would make it challenging to accurately count the number of females.\n\n3. Non-binary or Other Gender Classifications: The dataset might include non-binary or other gender classifications, which may complicate the process if the goal is to count strictly those who are identified as female.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: If the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we need to ensure we don't count the same individual more than once if they appear multiple times in the dataset.\n\n5. Data Spread Across Multiple Columns: Gender information might be spread across different columns and may require combining multiple fields to determine the gender of an individual.\n\n6. Data in Unstructured Format: If the data is not in a structured format (e.g., free text), it could be much more challenging to parse and interpret gender information.\n\n7. Incorrect Data Entries: There may be typos or incorrect entries for gender data, which could lead to inaccurate counts.\n\n8. Ambiguous Names or Titles: Relying on names or titles (such as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\") to infer gender could lead to inaccuracies, as these might not always correctly reflect an individual's gender identity.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it would be important to standardize and clean the dataset before attempting to count the number of females. This could involve data preprocessing steps such as normalizing text, handling missing values, deduplicating rows based on the primeKey, and developing a robust method for classifying gender when it is not explicitly provided."
