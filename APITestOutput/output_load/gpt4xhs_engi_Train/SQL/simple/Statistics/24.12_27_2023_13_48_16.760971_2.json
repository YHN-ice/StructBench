Duplication of data: If the same person is represented by multiple entries (rows with the same primeKey), we need to ensure that each individual is only counted once.\n\n4. Ambiguous or non-binary gender data: There may be entries that do not fit into traditional male/female gender categories, which could complicate counting if the task is strictly to count females.\n\n5. Case sensitivity: The dataset may contain entries with varying cases (e.g., 'female', 'Female', 'FEMALE'), requiring a case-insensitive approach to parsing the data.\n\n6. Formatting issues: The dataset may have irregularities in formatting that could obscure or confuse gender identification, such as leading/trailing spaces, typos, or inconsistent use of delimiters.\n\n7. Data spread across multiple columns: Gender information might not be confined to a single column, which would necessitate checking multiple fields to accurately assess gender.\n\n8. Large dataset size: If the dataset is significantly large, efficiency and computational resources could become a concern when parsing and analyzing the data.\n\n9.
