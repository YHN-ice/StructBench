Inconsistent Data: There may be inconsistencies or errors in the datatable such as missing values, duplicate entries, or incorrect data, which could affect the accuracy of our count.\n\n4. Complex Data Structure: The table could have a complex structure, with nested tables or multiple related tables that need to be joined using a primary key.\n\n5. Inconsistent Salary Format: Salaries could be represented in different formats or currencies, which would require normalization for accurate comparison.\n\n6. Ambiguity in PrimeKey: If the primeKey is not unique or not present for some entries, it could lead to an inaccurate count of individuals.\n\n7. Multiple Entries per Person: If the datatable includes multiple rows for the same person (identified by the same primeKey), we need to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\nTo give an accurate answer, we'll need to overcome these obstacles by ensuring we have a structured and consistent dataset, efficient processing capabilities, and clear rules for handling any inconsistencies or ambiguities.
