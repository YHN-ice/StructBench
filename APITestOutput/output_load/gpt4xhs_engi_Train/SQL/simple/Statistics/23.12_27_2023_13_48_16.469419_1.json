Inspect the information related to each individual's employment status and salary.\n2. Filter out individuals who are not employed (i.e., those who are 'unemployed' or 'retired').\n3. For the remaining individuals, count only those who have a salary greater than 557737.\n\nIn the given table, we have two relevant pieces of information for each individual:\n\n- The `status` column indicates whether the person is employed, retired, or unemployed.\n- The `salary` column provides their salary.\n\nTo find the number of people with a salary greater than 557737:\n\n1. Look at the `status` column and consider only those with an employment status other than 'unemployed' or 'retired'.\n2. Check the `salary` column for these individuals and count the number of salaries exceeding 557737.\n\nFrom the provided data table:\n\n- Individual b has a status of 'retired' but a salary of 737400.\n- Individual d has a status of 'unemployed' but a salary of 835543.\n- Individual f has a status of 'unemployed' but a salary of 963286.\n- Individual j has a status of 'retired' but a salary of 715231.\n\nSince all individuals with salaries greater than 557737 are either 'retired' or 'unemployed', none of them are currently working with such a salary.
