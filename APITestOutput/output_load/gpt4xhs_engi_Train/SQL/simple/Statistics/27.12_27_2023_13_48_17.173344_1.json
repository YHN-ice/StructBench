Therefore, based on the provided data, there are 4 people with a salary greater than 356006 (primeKey `b`, `d`, `e`, and `f`). \n\nNote: This assumes that the data provided is accurate, free of duplicates, and that the salary column contains no formatting issues that would require cleaning before comparison."
