        "Based on the provided data snippet, to determine the number of people with a salary greater than $90,973, we can directly scan and compare the salary values, assuming there are no aforementioned obstacles like data inconsistencies, missing data, or incorrect data types in the full dataset.\n\nGiven the provided dataset segment, we see the `salary` column in the second set of columns. Each row in this set corresponds to a person identified by their `primeKey`.
