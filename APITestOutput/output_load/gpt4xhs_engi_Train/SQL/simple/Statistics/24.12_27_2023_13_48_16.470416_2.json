Multiple Entries Per Person: If the same individual is listed multiple times in a data table (denoted by a primeKey), we need to ensure that each person is only counted once to avoid inflating the number of females.\n\n3. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: The data tables might use abbreviations or non-standard terms to indicate gender, which could lead to confusion if not standardized.\n\n4. Data Format Variations: The format of the data tables might vary, requiring different parsing methods or adaptations. For example, gender could be represented in different columns, or different tables could have different structures.\n\n5. Encoding Issues: If the data is encoded in a way that does not preserve character integrity (e.g., special characters for gender symbols), it may lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n6. Large Data Volumes: If the data set is vast, it may require efficient processing algorithms to parse through all the data without excessive computational time.\n\n7. Privacy Concerns: Depending on the source of the data, there may be privacy regulations restricting the analysis or requiring anonymization before processing.\n\n8.
