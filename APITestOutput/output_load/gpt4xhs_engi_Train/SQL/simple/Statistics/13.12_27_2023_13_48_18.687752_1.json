Data Consistency: If the datatable has multiple entries for some individuals (rows with the same primeKey), it's necessary to ensure that the salary information is consistent across these rows.

Efficient parsing and searching techniques would be needed to handle large datasets without significant delays.\n\n4. Data Type Conversion: Salaries may be represented as strings in the datatable. They would need to be converted to a numerical data type before any comparison with the numeric threshold.\n\n5. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows may have missing salary information, which would require handling for accurate counting.\n\n6. Ambiguous Data: There could be ambiguities in the data, such as whether the salary is annual, monthly, or weekly, which could affect whether the amount is indeed more than the specified threshold.\n\n7.
