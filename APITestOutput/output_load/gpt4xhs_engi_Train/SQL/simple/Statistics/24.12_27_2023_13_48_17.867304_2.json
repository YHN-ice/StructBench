Missing Data: Some rows might have missing gender information, which would require a decision on how to handle incomplete records.\n\n3. Data Ambiguity: If the dataset includes non-binary or other gender categories, it may not be clear how to classify these individuals if the question strictly asks for the number of females.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: If the same person is listed multiple times with the same or different primeKeys, it would be necessary to deduplicate the data to avoid counting the same female more than once.\n\n5. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If each person's data is spread across multiple rows (as per the mention of primeKey), one would need to ensure that all relevant rows are considered when counting a person's gender without double-counting.\n\n6. Data Errors: There could be errors or typos in the dataset that could misrepresent a person’s gender.\n\n7. Case Sensitivity: The parser will need to handle case sensitivity issues where gender identifiers might be in different cases (e.g., \"female\", \"Female\", \"FEMALE\").\n\n8.
