This includes handling any text-based entries or dealing with non-standard representations of numbers.\n\n6. **Sorting and Filtering**: The ability to filter out salaries that are less than or equal to $154,422 and count only those that exceed this amount is crucial. The algorithm or method used must correctly implement this filter.\n\n7. **Data Privacy and Security**: If the datatable contains sensitive information, such as real salary data, there might be privacy considerations that restrict how the data can be handled or displayed.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges can help in preparing to effectively parse the datatable and provide an accurate answer to the question asked."
