Missing Data: Some records may have missing gender information, leading to an undercount of females if not properly addressed.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: The dataset might contain duplicate rows for the same individuals, which could lead to double-counting if not properly managed using the primeKey.\n\n4. Ambiguous or Non-binary Gender Data: There might be entries with non-binary gender identifications or ambiguous terms that do not clearly categorize individuals as female.\n\n5. Mislabeling or Typos: Human error could lead to some individuals being mislabeled with the wrong gender, leading to inaccurate counts.\n\n6. Data Split Across Multiple Rows: If a person's information is split across multiple rows, it will be necessary to aggregate this data correctly to avoid miscounting.\n\n7. Case Sensitivity: The parsing process might be case-sensitive, so \"female\" and \"Female\" could be counted as different categories unless the parser accounts for such variations.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful data pre-processing, cleaning, consistency checks, de-duplication based on the primeKey, and normalization of gender data should be performed before counting the number of females in the dataset."
