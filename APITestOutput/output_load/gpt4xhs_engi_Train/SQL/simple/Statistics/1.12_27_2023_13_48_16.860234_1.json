        "Based on the provided input data and after considering the potential difficulties, we can count the number of people with a salary more than 960075 by examining the 'salary' column in the second part of the input data table. We need to make sure that we're only considering the 'status' as either employed, unemployed, or retired (since these are the ones who might have a salary), and ignore any potential duplicate or malformed entries.\n\nLet's count the number of people with a salary above 960075:\n\n- `a` has a salary of 997438 and is employed.\n- `b` has a salary of 995402 and is employed.\n- `c` has a salary of 264712 and is employed (less than 960075, so we don't count this).\n- `d` is unemployed but has a last known salary of 961199.\n- `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` all have salaries less than 960075 (so we don't count these).\n\nTherefore, there are **3** people with a salary more than 960075 (primeKey `a`, `b`, and `d`). While `d` is unemployed, the salary figure is still provided, indicating a last known salary above the threshold. If we were to count only currently employed individuals, then the answer would be 2."
