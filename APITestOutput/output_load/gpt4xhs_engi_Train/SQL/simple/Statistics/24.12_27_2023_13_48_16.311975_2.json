Multiple Entries for the Same Person: If the same person (with the same primeKey) has multiple entries, we need to ensure that they are only counted once to prevent overcounting.\n\n3.

Ambiguous Gender Information: The data may contain non-binary or undefined gender options which would require specific instructions on how to handle these cases.\n\n5. Case Sensitivity: Depending on how the data is structured, gender information might be case-sensitive, requiring the parser to be case-insensitive when counting female entries.\n\n6.
