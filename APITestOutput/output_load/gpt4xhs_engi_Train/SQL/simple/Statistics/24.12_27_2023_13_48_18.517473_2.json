Inconsistent Data Entries: If there are inconsistencies in the way gender is recorded (such as \"Female,\" \"F,\" \"fem,\" \"woman,\" etc.), this may require additional logic to interpret and count all variations that represent female.\n\n3. Missing or Null Values: Some rows might have missing or null values in the gender column, which would need to be handled or excluded from the count.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: If the datatable contains duplicate rows with the same primeKey, care must be taken to ensure that each individual is only counted once.\n\n5. Case Sensitivity: If the gender information is case-sensitive (e.g., \"Female\" vs. \"female\"), the parser will need to normalize the data before counting.\n\n6. Multiple Tables: If the information is spread across multiple tables, it may be necessary to join or cross-reference tables based on the primeKey to accurately determine gender.\n\n7.
