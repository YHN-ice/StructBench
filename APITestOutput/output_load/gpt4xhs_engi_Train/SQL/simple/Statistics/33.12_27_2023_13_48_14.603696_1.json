For example, some salaries might be entered with commas, decimal points, or currency symbols while others may not. This inconsistency would require normalization of data before performing comparisons.\n\n2. **Missing or Incorrect Data**: There might be missing or incorrect entries for salary amounts. Handling such situations requires a decision on whether to exclude such records or make assumptions to fill in the missing data.\n\n3. **Duplicate Records**: If rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there's a possibility of duplicate records that could skew the count. It's essential to ensure that each individual is counted only once.\n\n4. **Large Datasets**: If the dataset is large, performance considerations might come into play. Efficient parsing and counting mechanisms will be required to handle large volumes of data without running into memory or timeout issues.\n\n5. **Data Type Issues**: Salaries need to be treated as numerical values for comparison. If they are stored as strings or in a non-numeric format, they must be converted to numbers before any comparison can be made.\n\n6. **Sorting and Filtering Logic**: Depending on the dataset's structure, it might be necessary to implement sorting or filtering logic to efficiently identify the relevant records.\n\n7. **Complex File Structures**: If the file containing the datatable is complex (e.g., nested JSON, XML with various levels), extracting the relevant information might require intricate parsing logic.\n\nBefore proceeding, it's important to understand the structure of the datatable, the format of the salary entries, and any specific instructions for handling duplicates or inconsistent data.
