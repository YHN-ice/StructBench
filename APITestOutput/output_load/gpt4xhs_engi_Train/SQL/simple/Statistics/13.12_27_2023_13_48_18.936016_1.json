Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. Data Format: The format of the datatable could pose a challenge. If the data is not uniformly formatted or contains inconsistencies, it may require additional processing to accurately identify salary information.\n\n2. Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, it may be challenging to efficiently process the data to find the required information without performance issues.\n\n3. Multiple Entries: If the datatable contains multiple entries for the same person (as suggested by the mention of a primeKey), we would need to ensure that we only count each person once.\n\n4. Non-Numeric Values: The salary field might contain non-numeric values or special characters that could interfere with the ability to compare salaries as numeric values.\n\n5. Null or Missing Values: Some entries might have missing or null values for salary, which would need to be handled appropriately during the parsing process.\n\n6. Data Types: Ensuring that the salary data is interpreted as a numerical value and not as a string is crucial for making accurate comparisons.\n\n7. Sorting and Filtering: Depending on the tools and methods used to parse the datatable, implementing the sorting and filtering logic to isolate salaries above a certain threshold might be complex.\n\n8. Column Identification: Identifying which column corresponds to the salary could be an issue if the column headers are not clear or if the table contains many columns.\n\n9. Duplication: The datatable might contain duplicate records that need to be identified and removed to avoid counting the same person multiple times.\n\nOnce we have the datatable, we would need to address these potential difficulties by parsing and analyzing the data carefully to ensure we provide an accurate count of people with salaries exceeding 862405."
