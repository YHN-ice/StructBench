Duplication: The table might contain duplicate rows for the same person (same primeKey), which could lead to overcounting females if not properly handled.\n\n4. Ambiguous or Nonbinary Gender Entries: There may be entries with ambiguous gender designations or nonbinary options that don't fit into a strict male/female binary.\n\n5. Multiple Tables or Inconsistent Keys: If the data is split across multiple tables or uses inconsistent keys, it could complicate the process of counting distinct individuals.\n\n6. Data Quality Issues: Typographical errors, incorrect entries, or inconsistent capitalization could lead to inaccuracies in identifying all females in the dataset.\n\n7. Large Datasets: If the dataset is very large, performance considerations may come into play, requiring efficient parsing methods to count the number of females.\n\n8.
