        "Based on the given input and assuming all the provided data are part of one structured datatable, we can proceed with identifying the number of females as follows:\n\nThe datatable seems to be separated into two parts: the first part includes personal attributes (primeKey, gender, age, name, height, weight, color), while the second part includes employment-related information (primeKey, status, salary, company, location).\n\nEach person is uniquely identified by a `primeKey`, which links their personal attributes to their employment-related information.\n\nTo count the number of females, we look at the `gender` column in the personal attributes section. Here's how we would count them:\n\n1. We identify all rows in the datatable with the gender field marked as \"female.\"\n2. We ensure that we only count each `primeKey` once to avoid duplicates.\n\nFrom the provided input snippet:\n\n```\nprimeKey\tgender\tage\tname\theight\tweight\tcolor\na\t        female\t12\tc\t   205\t     159\tblack\nb\t        female\t59\td\t   124\t     179\tolive\nc\t        female\t57\te\t   189\t     112\tbrown\nd\t        female\t14\tf\t   138\t     76\twhite\n\nprimeKey\tstatus\t    salary\tcompany\tlocation\na\t        employed\t789205\tApple\tGA\nb\t        unemployed\t329660\tApple\tWA\nc\t        employed\t829377\tTwitter\tCA\nd\t        retired\t    14457\tNVIDIA\tCA\n```\n\nWe can see that there are four entries for females, with primeKeys `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Since each primeKey corresponds to a single individual and there are no duplicate keys, we can confirm that there are four females in this dataset. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: There are four female individuals in the provided datatable."
