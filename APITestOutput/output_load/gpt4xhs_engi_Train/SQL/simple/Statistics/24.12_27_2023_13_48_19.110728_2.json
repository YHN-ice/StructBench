Non-standard Gender Indicators: The table might use non-standard symbols, abbreviations, or terms to indicate gender, which requires an understanding of what each symbol means.\n\n3. Multiple Tables or Formats: The information might be spread across multiple tables or files, requiring cross-referencing and aggregation to determine the gender of individuals.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: The same person might be listed more than once with the same primeKey, which could lead to counting them multiple times if not identified and handled properly.\n\n5. Data Errors: Typos, incorrect entries, or formatting issues may lead to misidentification of gender.\n\n6. Ambiguous Names: Without clear gender identifiers, some names may be unisex and not provide enough information to determine gender without additional context.\n\n7. Privacy and Sensitivity: Gender data is sensitive, and care must be taken to ensure that the parsing process respects individuals' privacy and follows data handling regulations.\n\n8.
