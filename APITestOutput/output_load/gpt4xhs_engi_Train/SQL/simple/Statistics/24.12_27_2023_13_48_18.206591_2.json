Inconsistent Data Formats: If the data table includes gender information in various formats (e.g., \"F\", \"Female\", \"f\", \"female\", etc.), a parser would need to recognize all these as indicating a female gender.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some rows might have missing or incomplete information regarding gender, making it challenging to categorize those entries.\n\n3. Multiple Rows for Same Person: The same individual might be represented by multiple rows with the same primeKey. The parser must ensure it counts each person only once, even if they appear multiple times.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: There may be entries with non-binary or ambiguous gender indicators that are not clearly male or female.\n\n5. Data Errors: There could be errors in the data, such as typos or incorrect entries, which would affect the accuracy of gender identification.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: If the parser is case-sensitive, it may not recognize gender identifiers if they are not in the expected case (e.g., \"female\" vs. \"Female\").\n\n7. Language Variations: If the dataset includes multiple languages or cultural indicators of gender, the parser would need to account for those variations.\n\n8. Complex Data Structures: If the data is not in a simple flat format (e.g., nested tables, JSON objects, etc.), parsing might be more complex.\n\n9. Data Context: Additional context might be needed to accurately determine gender. For example, a name that is typically male in one culture might be female in another, and without context, the parser may misclassify the gender.\n\n10. Privacy Concerns: There could be privacy-related restrictions on how gender data is shared or displayed, which might limit the parser's ability to access or use this information.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can determine which of these potential obstacles are relevant and proceed accordingly."
