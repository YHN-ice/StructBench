Count the unique individuals that meet the criteria.\n\nFrom the input data given, it appears as if it's been formatted in a tabular form where each row after the header represents an individual's information split across two tables but connected by the `primeKey`. We have to match each person's employment and salary information with their demographic data.\n\nBy examining the salaries in the second table and filtering those that are more than 331516, we find the following entries:\n- Key `a` with a salary of 351291\n- Key `b` with a salary of 689676\n- Key `d` with a salary of 846274\n- Key `e` with a salary of 453286\n- Key `f` with a salary of 428686\n\nThe keys `c` is excluded because it has a salary of 6588, which is less than 331516.\n\nNow, counting the unique entries from above, there are **5 people** who have salaries more than 331516."
