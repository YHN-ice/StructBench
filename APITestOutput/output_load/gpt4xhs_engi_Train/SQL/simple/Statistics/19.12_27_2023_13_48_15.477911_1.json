Large volumes of data may require more advanced parsing techniques or tools to handle effectively.\n\n2. Data Format: The format in which the data is presented can affect how easily it can be parsed. For example, if the data is not in a structured format (like CSV or JSON), extracting the relevant information may be more complex.\n\n3. Inconsistent Data: There might be inconsistencies or errors in the data such as different formats for salary entries (e.g., some entries could include commas or currency symbols while others do not), which could affect the parsing logic.\n\n4. Multiple Entries for One Person: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there may be multiple rows for an individual with different salary information.
