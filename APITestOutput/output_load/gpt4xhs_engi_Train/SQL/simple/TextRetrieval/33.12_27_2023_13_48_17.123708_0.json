Missing data: If the row with primeKey \"d\" is missing the age field or the data is incomplete, it may be challenging to determine the age.\n\n3. Data spread across multiple tables: If the information about age is not contained within a single table, but rather spread across multiple datatables, it will require correctly joining these tables on the primeKey to get the complete information.\n\n4. Non-standard representation of age: Age might be represented in various ways, such as in years, months, or a date of birth from which the age needs to be calculated.\n\n5. PrimeKey ambiguity: There could be duplicate primeKeys due to data entry errors, making it unclear which record's age to report without additional identifying information.\n\n6.
