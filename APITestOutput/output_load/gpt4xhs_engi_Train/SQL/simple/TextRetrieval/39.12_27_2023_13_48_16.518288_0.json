        "Based on the input provided, you've given a table with two sections. The first section contains personal information about individuals, including their primeKey, gender, age, name, height, weight, and color. The second section includes details about their employment status, salary, company, and location. You're asking for the age of the record with primeKey 'h'.\n\nConsidering the input, the data appears to be consistently formatted in two separate but related tables. To answer your question, we only need to focus on the first section where the ages are listed. We find the row with primeKey 'h', and then we can directly read off the age.\n\nIn the first section of the table, the row with primeKey 'h' has the age listed as 65.\n\nTherefore, the age of the record with primeKey 'h' is 65 years old."
