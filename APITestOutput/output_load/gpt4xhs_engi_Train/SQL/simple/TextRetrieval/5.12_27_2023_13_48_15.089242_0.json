This would require determining which entry is the most current or relevant.\n\n5. **Complex Data Structure**: The data tables could be structured in a complex way, requiring advanced parsing techniques to navigate and extract the necessary information accurately.\n\n6. **Data Errors**: There could be errors within the data, such as typos or incorrect entries, which could lead to incorrect interpretations of the salary information.\n\n7. **Large Volume of Data**: If the datatable is very large, it may take some time to parse through all the data to find the specific primeKey and associated salary.\n\n8. **Access Permissions**: There may be restrictions or permissions required to access certain parts of the datatable, which would need to be navigated in order to retrieve the desired information.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that might be encountered.
