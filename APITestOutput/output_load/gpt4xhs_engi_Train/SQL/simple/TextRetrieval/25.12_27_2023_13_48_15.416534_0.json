Complex Data Structure: If the datatable has a complex structure with many columns, it might be difficult to quickly locate the necessary information regarding the status.\n\n5. Data Formatting Issues: If the datatable is not formatted consistently or if there are variations in how data is entered (e.g., different formats for dates, statuses, etc.), it may require additional processing to standardize the data before interpreting it.\n\n6.
