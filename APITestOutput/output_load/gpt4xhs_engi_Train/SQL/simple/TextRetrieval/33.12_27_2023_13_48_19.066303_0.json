Multiple Entries: There could be multiple entries with the same primeKey d, possibly with conflicting or duplicate information, necessitating a method to reconcile these records.\n\n4. Data Scattering: Relevant information about the age might be scattered across different rows or columns, and it will be essential to aggregate this information accurately.\n\n5. Data Errors: The input file could contain errors or inconsistencies (e.g., typos, incorrect data entries) that need to be identified and corrected before a reliable age can be determined.\n\n6.
