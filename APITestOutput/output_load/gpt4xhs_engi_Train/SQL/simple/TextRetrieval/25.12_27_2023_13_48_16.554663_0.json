The table is structured with columns and corresponding values for each individual keyed by 'primeKey'. The column headers indicate the type of data contained in each column.\n\nFor primeKey 'a', you can look across the row to find the 'height' column and read off the value. According to the input you've given, the height of the record with primeKey 'a' is 179. The units of height are not specified, but based on common practice, it is likely to be in centimeters.\n\nTherefore, the height for the record with primeKey 'a' is 179 (assuming the unit is centimeters)."
