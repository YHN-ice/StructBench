Inconsistent Data Formats: The heights might be recorded in different units (feet/inches vs. centimeters) or formats that require conversion or normalization.\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows may have missing height data or lack information about the work location.\n\n3. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If the information about a person's work location and height is spread across multiple rows with the same primeKey, it would require careful consolidation of data for each individual.\n\n4. Variability in Location Representation: The work location might be represented in various forms (e.g., 'NY', 'New York', 'NYC') and would need to be standardized to accurately filter for people working in NY.\n\n5. Duplicate Entries: There could be multiple entries for the same person that need to be identified and de-duplicated based on the primeKey.\n\n6. Data Errors and Typos: The data may contain errors or typos, especially in manual entries, which could affect the accuracy of height measurements or location details.\n\n7. Large Volume of Data: If the dataset is very large, it may present performance issues and require efficient parsing methods to process the information in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n8. Ambiguities in Location Data: There might be ambiguities if people work in multiple locations or if it's unclear whether 'NY' refers to New York City or New York State.\n\n9. Complex Filtering Logic: The logic to filter people by both location and height threshold might be complex, especially if there are additional criteria to consider.\n\n10. Data Privacy and Accessibility: There may be restrictions on accessing or sharing certain personal data, such as height or work locations, due to privacy considerations.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a clear understanding of the data structure, proper data cleaning methods, and implementing appropriate filtering logic would be necessary.
