For example, if height is not recorded in a consistent unit of measurement across entries, it could complicate the extraction of relevant data.\n\n2. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Some rows might have missing information for either the location (\"GA\" for Georgia) or the height, which would require handling these cases appropriately to ensure accurate counting.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**: The abbreviation \"GA\" might not be consistently used; instead, some entries might spell out \"Georgia\" or use a different abbreviation. This would require normalization of location data.\n\n4. **Data Accuracy**: If there are any inaccuracies in the data provided, such as typos or incorrect entries, this could lead to an incorrect count.\n\n5. **Multiple Entries for the Same Person**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there may be multiple entries for some individuals. It will be important to ensure that each person is only counted once, even if their data appears on multiple rows.\n\n6. **Handling Non-Numeric Values**: If there are any non-numeric values within the height column, the parser will need to handle or exclude these appropriately when comparing heights.\n\n7. **Performance Issues**: Depending on the size of the datatable, parsing and processing large amounts of data might lead to performance issues. Efficient data processing techniques may be required.\n\n8. **PrimeKey Identification**: Ensuring that all rows with the same primeKey are correctly identified as belonging to the same person requires careful attention to key matching.\n\nOnce you provide the input file, we can move forward with addressing these potential issues and answering your question accordingly."
