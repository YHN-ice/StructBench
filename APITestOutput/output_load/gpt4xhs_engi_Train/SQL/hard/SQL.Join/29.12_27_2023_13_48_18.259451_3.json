        "To find out how many people who work in HI are taller than 163, we need to combine information from both parts of the input data table. We need to find rows where the \"location\" is HI, and then check the corresponding \"height\" to see if it's greater than 163.\n\nFrom the given inputs, here are the steps to identify the individuals who meet both criteria:\n\n1. Look for individuals who work in HI (check the \"location\" column for \"HI\").\n2. Note their primeKey to match them with their personal information.\n3. Check the height for those individuals (in the \"height\" column) to see if it is greater than 163.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the provided data:\n\n- a: Works at Apple in NY, not HI.\n- b: Works at NVIDIA in IL, not HI.\n- c: Works at Microsoft in TX, not HI.\n- d: Works at Google in IL, not HI.\n- e: Retired, works at Twitter in HI; however, height is 125, which is not taller than 163.\n- f: Unemployed, works at Meta in NY, not HI.\n- g: Unemployed, works at Apple in NY, not HI.\n- h: Unemployed, works at Apple in HI; height is 212, which is taller than 163.\n- i: Works at Meta in TX, not HI.\n- j: Retired, works at Microsoft in NY, not HI.\n\nAccording to this analysis, there is only one person who works in HI and is taller than 163:\n\n- h: Female, 42 years old, height 212.\n\nSo the answer is that there is only **1 person** who works in HI and is taller than 163."
