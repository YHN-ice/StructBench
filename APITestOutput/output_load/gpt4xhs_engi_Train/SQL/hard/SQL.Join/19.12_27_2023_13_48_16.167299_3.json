Data Organization: The data may not be structured in a way that makes it easy to identify both the state someone works in and their height. They may be in different tables or require joining multiple tables using a primary key.\n\n2. Data Consistency: Heights could be recorded in different units (e.g., inches vs. cm), requiring conversion to ensure accuracy. Additionally, the state code might be written in different formats (e.g., 'IL', 'Illinois', 'il').\n\n3. Missing Data: Some records might have missing information regarding height or the state where the person works. This would require us to handle these cases appropriately.\n\n4. Duplicates: If there are multiple rows with the same primary key, we need to ensure we are not double-counting individuals.\n\n5. Data Range: Heights might be recorded as a range or with less precision, making it difficult to determine if they are greater than 161 precisely.\n\n6. Data Volume: If the dataset is very large, it could pose challenges in terms of processing time and memory usage.\n\n7. Errors and Outliers: There might be errors in data entry (e.g., extremely high or low values for height that are not plausible) that need to be detected and handled.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these challenges will be essential to accurately parse the datatables and provide the correct answer to the question. Now you can provide the datatable so I can begin the parsing process."
