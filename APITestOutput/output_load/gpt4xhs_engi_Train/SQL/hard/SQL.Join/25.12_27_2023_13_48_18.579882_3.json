Incomplete Data: If any rows in the data table are incomplete or missing key information such as height or work location, it will be challenging to include those entries in the count.\n\n2. Inconsistent Formats: Height could be recorded in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches) or formats, which may require standardization before comparison. Similarly, the location could be abbreviated differently (e.g., GA, Ga., Georgia) and may need normalization.\n\n3. Data Spread Across Rows: If the same person's information is spread across multiple rows (as indicated by the same primeKey), it's essential to aggregate this information correctly before making comparisons.\n\n4. Ambiguous Data: There could be ambiguities in terms like \"taller than 158.\" For instance, does it include people who are exactly 158 cm tall, or only those who are taller?\n\n5. Data Size and Performance: If the dataset is very large, performance could become an issue, and efficient data parsing strategies would be needed.\n\n6. Errors and Outliers: The dataset might contain errors or outliers (e.g., a height of 15.8 instead of 158) that need to be identified and handled.\n\n7. Duplicate Records: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there might be duplicate information that needs to be identified and merged to avoid double-counting.\n\n8. Case Sensitivity: In text-based fields like work locations, case sensitivity could be a concern if the parsing is done in a case-sensitive manner.\n\nNow that we've outlined potential difficulties, please provide the data tables so I can proceed with parsing the data and answering your question."

        "Unfortunately, there seems to be a misunderstanding. The provided data table does not mention an abbreviation \"GA\" which would typically refer to the U.S. state of Georgia. Without a location listed as \"GA\" in the dataset, we cannot directly answer the question \"How many people who work in GA are taller than 158?\".\n\nHowever, if we choose to interpret the question as asking how many people in the dataset are taller than 158 units (assumed to be in centimeters), and we overlook the location aspect, we can identify individuals who meet the height criterion. Since the height unit isn't specified but appears to be in centimeters based on typical human heights, I will proceed with this assumption.\n\nHere are the individuals taller than 158 cm:\n\n1. d (female, 48 years old) - 191 cm\n2. e (male, 41 years old) - 218 cm\n3. f (female, 22 years old) - 167 cm\n4. g (male, 49 years old) - 188 cm\n5. h (male, 60 years old) - 166 cm\n6. i (male, 32 years old) - 207 cm\n7. j (female, 13 years old) - 168 cm\n8. m (male, 32 years old) - 202 cm\n9. n (female, 14 years old) - 216 cm\n\nOut of these individuals, the following are employed (as indicated by the status \"employed\"):\n\n1. d - Google (TX)\n2. j - Apple (NY)\n3. k - Microsoft (CA)\n4. l - Google (CA)\n5. n - Meta (HI)\n\nNone of these employed individuals work in Georgia (GA), as none of the locations match GA.
