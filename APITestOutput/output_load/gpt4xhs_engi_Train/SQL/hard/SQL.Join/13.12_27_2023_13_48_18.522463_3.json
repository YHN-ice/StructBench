For instance, heights could be in different units (feet vs. centimeters) or written in various formats (166, 166cm, 1.66m), which would require standardization before comparison.\n\n3. **Data Accuracy:** The data provided could contain errors or inaccuracies that may affect the final count of people who meet the criteria.\n\n4. **Multiple Entries for the Same Person:** Since the same `primeKey` indicates the same person, we need to ensure that we are not double-counting individuals who may have multiple entries in the datatable.\n\n5. **Filtering by Multiple Criteria:** The answer requires filtering the datatable by both \"state\" (TX) and \"height\" (taller than 166). Proper logic must be applied to ensure that only individuals who meet both criteria are counted.\n\n6. **Large Datasets:** If the datatable is very large, performance issues might arise when processing the data, which might require efficient parsing methods or tools.\n\n7. **Ambiguous Height Measurement:** The question assumes height is in centimeters since it uses the value 166 without a unit of measure. However, if the table uses different units without specifying them, there could be confusion.\n\n8. **Data Parsing Errors:** There might be parsing errors due to unusual formatting within cells, special characters, or inconsistencies that make automated parsing difficult without preprocessing the data.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll be able to determine which of these potential difficulties and obstacles we'll need to address in order to correctly answer the question."
