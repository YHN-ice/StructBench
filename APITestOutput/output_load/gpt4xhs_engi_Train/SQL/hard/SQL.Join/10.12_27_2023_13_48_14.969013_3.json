If the data is not joined correctly, it might lead to counting individuals more than once or missing out on relevant data points.\n\n3. **Data Volume**: If the dataset is very large, it could pose computational challenges that require efficient parsing and querying methods.\n\n4. **Non-Numerical Values**: The dataset might include non-numerical values for height (e.g., \"N/A\", \"unknown\"), which need to be handled appropriately.\n\n5. **Data Integrity**: There may be inaccuracies or missing information within the dataset that could lead to incorrect results.\n\n6. **Data Interpretation**: If heights are given in a variety of formats or measurement systems (e.g., feet and inches vs. centimeters), there may be a need for conversion to a consistent measurement before making comparisons.\n\n7. **PrimeKey Uniqueness**: Ensuring that the primeKey is unique and accurately identifies a person is crucial. If there are errors with the primeKey, it could confuse the data relating to different individuals.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would typically employ data cleaning and validation techniques, ensure proper handling of missing and inconsistent data, potentially convert units where necessary, and utilize queries or algorithms that efficiently parse through and analyze the dataset.
