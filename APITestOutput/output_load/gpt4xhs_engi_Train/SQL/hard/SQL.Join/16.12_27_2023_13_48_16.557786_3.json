        "To determine the number of people who work in Illinois (IL) and are taller than 168 cm, we will analyze the provided input data.

The first table contains personal information including height, while the second table contains employment information including work location. We need to use the `primeKey` to join the relevant data from the two tables for each person.\n\nBased on the provided input, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1.
