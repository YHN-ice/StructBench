        "To determine the number of people who work in GA (Georgia) and are taller than 173, we need to filter the data based on two criteria:\n\n1. The location of their work should be \"GA\".\n2. Their height should be greater than 173.\n\nFrom the provided input, we can cross-reference the `primeKey` from the first table with the `primeKey` in the second table to identify the individuals' work locations and heights. We will consider only those rows where both conditions are met.\n\nLet's filter out the data based on the given criteria:\n\n- b: height = 179, location = HI (Does not work in GA)\n- c: height = 220, location = HI (Does not work in GA)\n- d: height = 197, location = GA (Works in GA and is taller than 173)\n- e: height = 132, location = GA (Works in GA but is not taller than 173)\n- f: height = 208, location = CA (Does not work in GA)\n- g: height = 132, location = WA (Does not work in GA)\n- h: height = 172, location = IL (Does not work in GA)\n- i: height = 149, location = IL (Does not work in GA)\n- j: height = 166, location = HI (Does not work in GA)\n- k: height = 185, location = GA (Works in GA and is taller than 173)\n- l: height = 175, location = HI (Does not work in GA)\n- m: height = 205, location = IL (Does not work in GA)\n- n: height = 136, location = CA (Does not work in GA)\n\nBased on the above filtering:\n\nThere is only one person (marked with primeKey 'd') who works in GA and has a height greater than 173.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there is only 1 person who works in GA and is taller than 173."
