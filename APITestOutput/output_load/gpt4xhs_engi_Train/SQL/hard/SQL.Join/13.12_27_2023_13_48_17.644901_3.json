        "Based on the provided input tables, we want to determine how many people who work in Hawaii (HI) are taller than 172 cm. We need to join the tables on the primeKey and then filter based on the location and height criteria.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Join the tables using the primeKey to ensure you have a complete dataset with both the location and height information for each individual.\n2. Filter the joined dataset to only include individuals who work in Hawaii (HI).\n3. Count the number of individuals from the filtered dataset who are taller than 172 cm.\n\nAfter joining the tables based on the primeKey, we would have a dataset that includes both height and location for each individual. Since there are 10 individuals in total and their respective locations are provided, we can directly identify those working in Hawaii (HI). Looking at the tables, there is one person (g) who is retired but associated with HI location.\n\nNow let's check if this person is taller than 172 cm:\n\n- g: female, 25 years old, height = 192 cm, retired, company = Google, location = HI\n\nSince individual g has a height of 192 cm, which is greater than 172 cm and is located in Hawaii (HI), the answer is:\n\nOne person who works in Hawaii (HI) is taller than 172 cm. However, it's important to note that this person's status is retired, not employed. If you were strictly looking for employed individuals, you would need to filter by 'employed' status as well.
