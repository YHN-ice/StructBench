Inconsistent Data Formats: The height data might be presented in different units or formats (e.g., feet and inches vs. centimeters), requiring conversion to consistently compare heights.\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some rows might have missing data for height or location, making it unclear whether those individuals meet the criteria.\n\n3. Data Entry Errors: There could be typos or incorrect entries that misrepresent an individual’s height or work location.\n\n4. Ambiguous Location Identifiers: The abbreviation \"WA\" could stand for Western Australia or Washington State, among other possibilities. Without clear context, it might be unclear which \"WA\" is meant.\n\n5. Duplicates: The same individual could be listed more than once, and without careful handling of unique identifiers (primeKey), they might be counted multiple times.\n\n6. Large Data Volume: If the dataset is very large, it may pose technical challenges in terms of parsing and processing efficiency.\n\n7. Complex File Structure: The data might be spread across multiple tables or files that need to be joined or cross-referenced using the primeKey.\n\n8. Interpretation of \"Taller Than\": We must determine if \"taller than 177\" includes individuals who are exactly 177 cm tall or only those who exceed this height.\n\nRecognizing these potential obstacles will help us to carefully examine the input file and ensure that we accurately count the number of people who meet the given criteria."
