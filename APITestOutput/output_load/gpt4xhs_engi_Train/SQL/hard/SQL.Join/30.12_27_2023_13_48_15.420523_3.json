        "To determine how many people who work in IL (Illinois) are taller than 157 units (assuming the height is in centimeters since it's the most common unit for height and there's no specific unit mentioned), we need to:\n\n1. Identify the people who work in Illinois (IL).\n2. Check their heights to see if they are greater than 157.\n3. Count the number of people who meet both criteria.\n\nFrom the input data provided, we can see that there are two individuals with a location specified as IL:\n\n- g (male, age 14, height 155)\n- l (male, age 68, height 189)\n\nOut of these two, only individual l has a height greater than 157. However, we also need to check if these individuals are employed or not since the question specifically asks for people who work in IL.\n\nLooking at the employment status:\n- g is employed at Meta in IL but does not meet the height requirement (155 which is less than 157).\n- l is unemployed and hence does not meet the criteria of working in IL.\n\nSo, based on the provided data, there are zero people who work in IL and are taller than 157."
