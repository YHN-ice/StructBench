Data Errors: There may be typographical or data entry errors in the datatable that could lead to an inaccurate count if not handled or corrected.\n\n4. PrimeKey Duplication: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, careful attention is needed to ensure that duplicates are not counted multiple times.\n\n5.
