Incomplete or Missing Data: If any of the rows corresponding to individuals who work in GA are missing height information, it would be difficult to determine if they are taller than 158 cm.\n\n2. Inconsistent Data Formats: Heights may be recorded in different units (e.g., inches vs. centimeters) or formats, requiring conversion or standardization before comparison.\n\n3. Multiple Rows per Individual: Since the same primeKey refers to the same person, there may be multiple rows with different pieces of information for a single individual. It is important to avoid double-counting these individuals.\n\n4. Inconsistent Location Notation: The abbreviation \"GA\" must be consistently used to denote Georgia. If there are variations in the way location is recorded (e.g., full state name, different abbreviations), it could lead to missing relevant data.\n\n5. Data Sorting and Filtering: The data will likely need to be filtered to include only those individuals who work in GA, and then further sorted or filtered to identify those who are taller than 158 cm.\n\n6. Ambiguities in Height Measurement: If height is not measured in centimeters, there may be a need for conversion. Additionally, if heights are provided in a range or with qualifiers (e.g., \"about 160 cm\"), this could introduce uncertainty.\n\n7. Data Errors: There may be typos or incorrect entries in the datatable, which can lead to inaccurate counts if not identified and corrected.\n\n8. Large Datasets: If the datatable is very large, it may require efficient parsing techniques to process the data in a reasonable amount of time without overwhelming system resources.\n\nBy anticipating these challenges, we can be more prepared to accurately parse the datatables and provide the correct answer once we receive the input file."
