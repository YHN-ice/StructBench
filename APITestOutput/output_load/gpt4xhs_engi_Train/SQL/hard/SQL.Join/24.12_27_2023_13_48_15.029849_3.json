The individual's height must be greater than 180 cm.\n\nGiven the input, we have two separate lists: one detailing personal attributes (including height) and another detailing professional attributes (including work location). We can cross-reference these lists using the `primeKey` to filter the individuals who meet both criteria.\n\nBased on the input provided, we examine the `location` column in the professional attributes list to find individuals who work in HI. Then, we check the corresponding `height` from the personal attributes list for those individuals.\n\nFrom the professional attributes list, we identify that primeKeys 'a', 'c', and 'j' are associated with HI. Now let's look at their heights:\n\n- primeKey 'a': height is 197\n- primeKey 'c': height is 188\n- primeKey 'j': height is 190\n\nAll three individuals ('a', 'c', and 'j') have heights greater than 180 cm.
