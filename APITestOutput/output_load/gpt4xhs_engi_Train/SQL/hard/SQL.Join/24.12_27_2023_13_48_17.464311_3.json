If the data is not in a flat structure and instead nested or related across multiple tables, it would require complex queries or logic to join and filter the data correctly.\n\n5. **Significant Data Volume**: If the datatable is very large, performance considerations may need to be taken into account. Efficient algorithms and queries would be required to handle large datasets without excessive processing time.\n\n6. **Ambiguities in PrimeKey Relations**: If the primeKey is supposed to relate rows that refer to the same person, there might be ambiguities if the primeKey is not unique or if there are discrepancies in the data associated with the same primeKey.\n\n7. **Handling of Heights Exactly at 180**: The question specifies \"taller than 180.\" Clarification might be needed on whether to include individuals who are exactly 180 cm tall, or if the cutoff should strictly be greater than 180 cm.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, these potential obstacles can be specifically addressed to ensure an accurate answer is given."

        "To determine the number of people who work in Hawaii (HI) and are taller than 180 cm, we need to filter the data based on two criteria: the location being HI and the height being greater than 180. Given that the input appears to be from a database or a structured dataset, we'll proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Check for data consistency, especially that the height is in the same unit (cm) for all individuals.\n2. Verify that each row has the necessary data: specifically, that each individual has both a height and a location recorded.\n3. Filter the dataset to include only those rows where `location` is HI for the `employed` status.\n4. From the filtered dataset, count the number of individuals whose `height` is greater than 180.\n\nFollowing these steps with the provided input:\n\n1. **Data Consistency**: We will assume heights are consistently provided in centimeters.\n2. **Missing Data**: The input appears complete where necessary for our filtering.\n3. **Filter by Location and Employment Status**:\n\n```\na\tmale\t38\tk\t200\t78\tbrown\temployed\t783012\tGoogle\tHI\nh\tfemale\t40\tr\t179\t129\tswarthy\tunemployed\t976435\tNVIDIA\tHI\n```\n\nIn the provided input data, we have two people based in HI, one employed (a) and one unemployed (h).\n\n4. **Filter by Height**: Among those who work in HI, we need to find who is taller than 180 cm. From our filter in step 3, only person with primeKey 'a' fits both being employed and being in HI.\n\nFinally:\n\nPerson 'a' (male, age 38, name 'k') works in HI and is 200 cm tall, which is taller than 180 cm.\n\n**Answer**: Based on the input data given, there is exactly 1 person who works in HI and is taller than 180 cm."
