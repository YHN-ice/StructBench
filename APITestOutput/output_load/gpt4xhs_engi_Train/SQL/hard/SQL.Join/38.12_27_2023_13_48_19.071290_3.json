When parsing datatables to answer a question like \"How many people who work in NY are taller than 169?\" there are several potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Data formatting inconsistencies**: There might be inconsistencies in how the data is formatted, such as how the height or location is recorded (e.g., using different units of measurement for height, such as feet vs. centimeters, or abbreviations vs. full names for locations).\n\n2. **Missing data**: Some entries may have missing information for the location or height, which would require a decision on how to handle these cases.\n\n3. **Data spread across multiple rows or tables**: The information may be spread across multiple rows with a common key or even across different tables, requiring proper joining or consolidation.\n\n4. **Ambiguous location data**: The term \"NY\" could potentially refer to New York City, New York State, or perhaps even a company or institution with the acronym NY. Thus, clarification might be needed.\n\n5. **Error handling**: There may be errors in the data, such as typos in the location field or unrealistic values for height (e.g., a height of 16.9 instead of 169).\n\n6. **Data types and comparison**: Ensuring that numerical data is properly recognized and compared as numbers rather than strings is essential for accurate comparisons (e.g., '169' as a string vs. 169 as an integer).\n\n7. **Duplicate entries**: The same person might be listed multiple times in the data set. It's important to identify and count each individual only once.\n\n8. **Efficient computation**: Depending on the size of the data set, one may need to consider the most efficient way to iterate over the data to provide the answer in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n9. **Case sensitivity**: When filtering by location, it's important to account for case sensitivity to ensure all relevant entries are included (e.g., 'ny' vs. 'NY').\n\nTo effectively deal with these issues, it's crucial to implement thorough data validation, standardization, and cleaning processes before attempting to answer the question at hand."
