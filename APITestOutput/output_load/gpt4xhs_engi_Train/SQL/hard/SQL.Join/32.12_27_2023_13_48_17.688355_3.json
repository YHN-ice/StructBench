To make an accurate count, we need to combine the data using the 'primeKey' and then apply the filters.\n\nLet's go through the datatable and apply these conditions:\n\n- Person c: height is 219, works in Microsoft GA - meets both conditions\n- Person i: height is 195, works in Meta GA - meets both conditions\n- Person k: height is 170, works in OPENAI GA - meets both conditions\n- Person n: height is 215, works in OPENAI GA - meets both conditions\n\nNow, let's count the number of people who meet both conditions: \nThe total is 4 people (c, i, k, n) who work in GA and are taller than 150."
