The process must correctly identify and convert all heights to a consistent unit for comparison.\n\n4. **Varying Abbreviations or Codes for Illinois**: The location 'IL' might be represented in different ways (e.g., 'Illinois', 'IL', 'Ill', etc.), so the parser must standardize location data before filtering.\n\n5. **Large Datasets**: If the datatable is very large, performance and efficiency in parsing and filtering the data might become an issue, requiring optimization of the code used for parsing.\n\n6. **Data Spread Across Multiple Tables**: If the relevant data (height and work location) is spread across different tables or files, there might be a need to join or merge tables based on the primeKey before filtering.\n\n7. **Human Error**: Typos in the data, such as incorrect height values or mislabeling of the state, could lead to inaccurate counts.\n\n8. **Case Sensitivity**: The parser will need to handle variations in case sensitivity, as some entries may have 'il', 'IL', 'Il', or 'iL'.\n\n9. **Non-standard Height Representation**: Heights may also be recorded with additional characters (like '178cm' or '178 cm'), requiring the parser to extract numeric values for comparison.\n\n10. **Ambiguous Location Data**: Some records may have ambiguous location data that don't clearly indicate whether the person works in IL or not.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties requires careful planning of the parser logic to ensure accurate data extraction, transformation, and counting."
