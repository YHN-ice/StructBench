Incomplete Data: The datatable might have missing entries for some individual's work location or height, which could make it difficult to determine if they meet both criteria.\n\n2. Inconsistent Formatting: If the data is not consistently formatted, particularly for the height and location fields, it may require additional processing to standardize the information before analysis.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: The datatable may contain duplicate entries for the same person (indicated by the same primeKey). We must ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n4. Ambiguous Location Data: The abbreviation \"WA\" could potentially refer to different locations (e.g., Washington state in the USA or Western Australia in Australia). Clarification or additional context may be necessary to ensure we're considering the correct geographic area.\n\n5. Unit of Measurement: The unit of measurement for height needs to be clear. If it's in centimeters, we can use the value 154 directly, but if it's in another unit (e.g., inches), we'll need to convert it to the appropriate unit before comparison.\n\n6. Data Parsing Errors: Parsing errors could occur if the data is complex or formatted in an unconventional way, which might require custom parsing logic or error handling.\n\n7.
