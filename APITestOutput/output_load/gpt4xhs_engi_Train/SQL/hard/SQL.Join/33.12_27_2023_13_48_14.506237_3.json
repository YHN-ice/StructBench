        "To find out how many people who work in California (CA) are taller than 179 cm, we will need to filter the input data based on two criteria:\n\n1. The person's height must be greater than 179 cm.\n2. The person's location (where they work) must be in CA.\n\nFrom the given input data, we can create a table that joins both sets of data on the `primeKey`, so we can see each person's height and location in one record. However, since the input is provided as text, I'll demonstrate how we would approach this by manually examining the data.\n\nLooking at the first part of the input, let's identify all individuals taller than 179 cm:\n\n- c, male, 37, p, **197**, 98, white\n- d, female, 37, q, **212**, 84, swarthy\n- i, female, 58, v, **209**, 110, olive\n- j, female, 47, w, **212**, 99, olive\n- k, male, 27, x, **195**, 148, black\n- l, female, 68, y, **195**, 100, swarthy\n- m, female, 32, z, **195**, 81, swarthy\n- o, female, 14, bb, **192**, 133, olive\n\nNow we have identified the individuals taller than 179 cm. Next, let's check their work locations:\n\n- c (197 cm) works at OPENAI in IL\n- d (212 cm) is unemployed (no company location)\n- i (209 cm) is unemployed (no company location)\n- j (212 cm) works at OPENAI in NY\n- k (195 cm) works at Microsoft in WA\n- l (195 cm) is retired (no company location)\n- m (195 cm) is retired (no company location)\n- o (192 cm) is retired (no company location)\n\nAfter cross-referencing the location data with the individuals who are taller than 179 cm, we notice that none of them have a listed work location in CA. It's worth mentioning that those who are unemployed or retired do not have a company location specified and thus cannot be considered working in CA based on the given data.\n\nTherefore, according to the provided input and assuming all data is accurate and consistently formatted as"
