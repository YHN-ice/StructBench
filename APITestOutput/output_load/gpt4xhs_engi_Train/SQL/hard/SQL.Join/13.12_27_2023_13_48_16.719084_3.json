Data Formatting: If the data is not consistently formatted, particularly for the height and state columns, it could be difficult to accurately filter and count the individuals.\n\n2. Missing Data: If there are missing values in the height or state columns, it might be challenging to determine whether those individuals meet the criteria.\n\n3. Inconsistent Units: The height could be recorded in different units (centimeters, meters, inches, etc.). All heights would need to be in the same unit to make a proper comparison.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: Since you mentioned that rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we need to ensure that we don't count the same person more than once if there are multiple rows for some individuals.\n\n5. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If data pertaining to one individual's work location and height are in separate rows, we need to be able to correctly join this information based on the primeKey.\n\n6. Large Dataset: If the dataset is particularly large, it might require efficient parsing techniques or data processing tools to handle the volume of data without performance issues.\n\n7.
