        "To determine how many people who work in NY are taller than 169, we will need to find the records of people who both work in NY and have a height greater than 169.\n\nBased on the data provided in the input, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

From the remaining individuals, count those whose height is greater than 169.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the data provided:\n\nFirst, we link the individuals' demographic and professional details using the primeKey. Then we look for individuals located in NY:\n\n- primeKey 'a' corresponds to individual 's' with a height of 204, works in NY, and is unemployed.\n- primeKey 'b' is located in CA, so we ignore this record.\n- ...\n- primeKey 'n' corresponds to individual 'fb' with a height of 136, works in NY, and is retired.\n\nNow we will count those taller than 169 among these individuals:\n\n- Individual 's' with a height of 204 is taller than 169 and works in NY.\n- Individual 'fb' with a height of 136 is NOT taller than 169 and works in NY.\n\nThe result is that there is only one person (individual 's') who works in NY and is taller than 169.
