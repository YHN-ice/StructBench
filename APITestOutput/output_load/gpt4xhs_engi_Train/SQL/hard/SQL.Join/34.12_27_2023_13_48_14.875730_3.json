When parsing data tables to answer the question about how many people who work in Georgia (GA) are taller than 164 cm, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Data formatting and consistency**: If the data is not consistently formatted—for instance, if the height is listed in different units in different rows or if the state abbreviation is not standardized—it may require additional data cleaning or transformation.\n\n2. **Missing data**: If some rows are missing information for the state of employment or height, determining whether these individuals meet the criteria could be challenging.\n\n3. **Data accuracy**: The data might contain errors or typos, such as incorrect state abbreviations or unrealistic height values, which could impact the accuracy of the count.\n\n4. **Duplicate entries**: Since the same primeKey refers to the same person, ensuring that duplicates are not counted is important.

        "Based on the input provided, we want to find out how many people who work in Georgia (GA) are taller than 164 cm.
