Inconsistent formatting: If the tables are not formatted consistently, or if there are discrepancies in how the primeKey or height is recorded across different rows or tables, it may take additional time to accurately parse the data.\n\n3. Missing data: If the row with primeKey d does not include height information, or if that row is missing entirely, it won't be possible to provide an answer without further clarification or additional data.\n\n4. Incorrect primeKey identification: The primeKey must be correctly identified as 'd'. If there are similar identifiers, such as 'D', 'bd', or 'ad', care must be taken to select the correct one.\n\n5.
