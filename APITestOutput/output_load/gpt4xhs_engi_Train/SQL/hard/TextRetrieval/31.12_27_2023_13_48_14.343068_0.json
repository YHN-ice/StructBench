Inconsistent Formatting: If the data within the tables is inconsistently formatted, it could make it difficult to accurately parse and identify the necessary information.\n\n3. Missing Data: If the table has missing or incomplete entries for the primeKey provided, it may not be possible to retrieve the name associated with that key.\n\n4. Non-unique primeKeys: If primeKeys are not unique and the same key is associated with multiple records, additional context or criteria may be needed to identify the correct record.\n\n5. Ambiguity in Column Names: If the table has ambiguous column names, it might be unclear which column contains the name that is being requested.\n\n6.

Access Restrictions: There might be permissions or access restrictions on the data source that prevent accessing or querying the data directly.\n\n10. Data Types and Encoding: Potential issues with data types and encoding may arise, such as numeric vs. string representations of keys or dealing with character encoding issues when parsing names.\n\nOnce we have access to the actual input file, we can determine if any of these potential obstacles apply and then proceed to find the solution accordingly."
