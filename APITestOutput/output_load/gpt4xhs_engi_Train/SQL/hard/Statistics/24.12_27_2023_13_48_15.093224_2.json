Inconsistent data formats: Gender might be represented in various ways (e.g., 'F', 'Female', 'f', etc.), requiring normalization of data before counting.\n\n2. Missing data: Some rows might not have gender information filled in, leading to undercounting if those missing data points pertain to females.\n\n3. Duplication of records: Since the same `primeKey` refers to the same person, there might be duplicate rows pertaining to the same individual. These duplicates need to be identified and removed from the count to avoid overcounting.\n\n4. Ambiguous or non-binary gender representations: The data may include gender representations that are not strictly 'male' or 'female', which would need specific instructions on how to handle for the count.\n\n5. Case sensitivity: The way the datatable is parsed might be case-sensitive, which would require a case-insensitive approach to accurately count all instances of females.\n\n6. Data errors: Typos or incorrect entries in the gender field could lead to misclassification and inaccurate counts.\n\n7.
