For instance, salaries could be listed with or without commas and decimal points, or in some cases, they could be represented as text (e.g., \"nine hundred thousand\").\n\n2. **Data Size and Complexity**: The datatable may be very large or complex, which could make it computationally intensive and time-consuming to process.\n\n3. **Mixed Data Types**: The salary data might be mixed in with other types of data, requiring an extraction process to identify which data is actually representing the salary.\n\n4. **Duplicate Entries**: If there are duplicate rows for the same person (same primeKey), care must be taken to count each person only once, even if their salary is listed multiple times.\n\n5. **Incorrect Data**: There could be incorrect data entries due to typos or errors in the data entry process which might lead to incorrect counting.\n\n6. **Data Accessibility**: The datatable might be in a format that is not easily readable by standard parsing tools or could be protected in a way that makes it difficult to access the information needed.\n\n7. **System Limitations**: There might be limitations with the system being used to parse the datatables, such as memory constraints, processing power, or restrictions on the types of operations that can be performed on the data.\n\n8. **Unstructured Data**: If the datatable lacks a clear structure or if it's semi-structured, such as in free text or narrative form, extracting the necessary information can be more challenging.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, we would need to ensure that we have a robust parsing approach that can accurately identify and count unique individuals with salaries higher than the specified amount while mitigating any issues related to data consistency, size, and quality."
