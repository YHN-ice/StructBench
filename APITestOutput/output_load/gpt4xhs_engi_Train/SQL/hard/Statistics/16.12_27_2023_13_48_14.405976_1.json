Data format and consistency: The data may not be consistently formatted, which could make parsing and comparing salary figures more difficult. We would need to ensure that all salary data is in a consistent format to perform accurate comparisons.\n\n2. Missing or incorrect data: Some entries may be missing salary information, or the salary data could be incorrect due to input errors. This would affect the accuracy of our count.\n\n3. Data type issues: The salary data might be stored as strings instead of numbers, which would require conversion before performing numerical comparisons.\n\n4. Large dataset: If the dataset is very large, this could impact the efficiency of the parsing process and potentially slow down the computation.\n\n5. Multiple entries for the same person: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there could be duplicate entries for individuals. This would mean ensuring that each person is only counted once, regardless of how many times their salary is listed above the threshold.\n\n6. Confusing column names or ambiguous data representation: It might not be immediately clear which column represents salary if the column names are ambiguous or if the data is represented in a confusing manner.\n\n7. Data spread across multiple tables: If salary information is spread across multiple datatables, we would need to ensure that all relevant tables are parsed and cross-referenced correctly based on the primeKey.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to carefully clean, normalize, and validate the data before performing the count. Once we have the input file, we can address these issues accordingly."
