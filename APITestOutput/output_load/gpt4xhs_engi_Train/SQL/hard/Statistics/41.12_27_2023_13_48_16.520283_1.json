For example, salary figures could be presented with different currency symbols, include commas for thousands, or even be written out in words.\n\n2. **Large Dataset**: If the datatable is very large, it could be difficult to process all of it efficiently, especially if the parser has memory or time constraints.\n\n3. **Duplicate Records**: If the same person has multiple entries with different salary records, we need a way to ensure that each person is only counted once. This requires identifying and handling duplicate records based on a unique identifier (e.g., primeKey).\n\n4. **Data Type Issues**: Salary data might not be stored as numeric values, which would require conversion before comparison. Additionally, there may be missing or null values that need to be handled appropriately.\n\n5. **Accuracy of Data**: There might be inaccuracies or outliers in the data that could skew the results if not handled correctly. Data validation checks would be necessary to ensure that the salaries are accurate and reasonable.\n\n6. **Performance Optimization**: Depending on the parser's implementation, there might be more efficient ways to count the number of people with a specific salary range without having to iterate through every single record.\n\n7. **Sorting and Filtering**: Efficiently sorting or filtering the data to quickly identify the relevant records could be a challenge depending on the tools and methods used.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: The parser must be able to handle errors gracefully, such as corrupted data entries or unexpected data types in the salary field.\n\n9. **Encoding and Character Set Issues**: If the datatable is in a file with a specific encoding, there might be issues with reading special characters or symbols correctly.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties requires careful planning, robust parsing logic, error checking, and possibly preprocessing of the data."
