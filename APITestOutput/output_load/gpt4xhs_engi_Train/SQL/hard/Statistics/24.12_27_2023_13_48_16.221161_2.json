For example, if some rows list gender as \"F,\" \"female,\" \"Woman,\" etc., it might require additional logic to group these together.\n\n2. **Missing or Incomplete Data:** Some rows might have missing or incomplete information regarding gender, which could lead to an inaccurate count unless there's a way to infer or correct this data.\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries:** If there are duplicate entries for the same person with the same primeKey but different gender data, it might be challenging to determine which entry is correct and avoid double-counting individuals.\n\n4. **Large Datasets:** A very large dataset could cause performance issues, requiring efficient algorithms to parse the data and count the number of females.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity:** The parser will need to handle the case sensitivity of the text.
