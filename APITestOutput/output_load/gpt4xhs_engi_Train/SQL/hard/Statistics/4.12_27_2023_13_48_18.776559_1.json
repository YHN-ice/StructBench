If the format is not standardized or consistent, it may require additional steps to clean and organize the data before analysis.\n\n2. Data Size: If the data set is very large, it may be challenging to process it efficiently. Large data sets can lead to longer processing times and may require more memory and computation power.\n\n3. PrimeKey Association: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, care must be taken to ensure that each person is counted only once, even if their information spans multiple rows.\n\n4. Missing or Incorrect Data: There may be rows with missing salary information or incorrect salary values that need to be handled appropriately. \n\n5. Data Type Issues: The salary data might not be stored as numerical values, which would require conversion before any comparison to the threshold value (773284) can be made.\n\n6. Complex Data Structures: If the data is nested or has complex structures, additional parsing might be necessary to extract the salary information.\n\n7. Performance Considerations: Depending on the method used to parse and filter the data, there may be performance considerations to ensure that the operation is performed in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n8. Sorting and Filtering Logic: Developing accurate sorting and filtering logic to identify individuals with a salary greater than 773284 without duplicating counts for individuals with multiple entries.\n\n9. Data Privacy: If the datatable contains sensitive information, there might be privacy considerations that restrict how the data can be handled or shared.\n\nBy considering these potential difficulties beforehand, we can prepare solutions to handle them effectively when parsing the datatable to count the number of people with a salary greater than 773284."

Also, to ensure we are only considering those who are actively working (employed), we'll need to consider the 'status' column as well.\n\nBased on the provided data, here are the rows from the datatable where individuals are employed and have a salary greater than 773284:\n\n- primeKey b: employed with a salary of 938954\n- primeKey e: retired with a salary of 959173 (Note: This individual is retired, not employed, so we do not count him/her)\n- primeKey g: unemployed with a salary of 986120 (Note: This individual is unemployed, not employed, so we do not count him/her)\n- primeKey i: employed with a salary of 912994\n- primeKey k: retired with a salary of 888272 (Note: This individual is retired, not employed, so we do not count him/her)\n\nFrom this data, we can see that there are 2 people (primeKey b and primeKey i) who are employed and have a salary greater than 773284."
