If they are treated as strings, the comparison with the threshold (540529) might not work as expected.\n\n5. **Large Dataset Performance**: If the dataset is very large, performance might be an issue. Efficient parsing and aggregation methods would be needed to process the data quickly.\n\n6. **Correct Parsing of primeKey**: Correctly identifying and using the primeKey to associate different rows with the same individual is crucial.
