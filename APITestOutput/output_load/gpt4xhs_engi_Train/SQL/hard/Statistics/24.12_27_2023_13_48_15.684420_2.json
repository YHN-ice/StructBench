Multiple Entries: The same individual may be listed multiple times with the same primeKey. It is important to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n2. Inconsistent Data: The gender of individuals may be represented differently across entries (e.g., 'Female', 'F', 'Woman', etc.). It is necessary to identify all the terms that refer to the female gender.\n\n3. Missing Information: Some entries might have missing or null values for gender, which would require a decision on how to handle these cases.\n\n4. Data Quality: Typos or incorrect data entries could lead to misclassification of gender, so the parser has to account for common data entry errors.\n\n5. Ambiguous Names: Without clear gender indicators, names alone may not be sufficient to determine gender, especially for unisex names.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: The parser must handle case sensitivity issues where gender might be written in different cases (e.g., 'female', 'Female', 'FEMALE').\n\n7. Data Format: The format of the datatable needs to be understood (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML, etc.), and the parser must be able to extract the relevant information correctly.\n\n8. Column Headers: It's crucial to identify the correct column that indicates gender, which requires understanding the headers or schema of the datatable.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we might need to normalize text (for gender representation), deduplicate entries based on the primeKey, handle missing values appropriately, and implement error-checking mechanisms.
