Apply the salary filter to count only those individuals with salaries above 942623.\n\n**Step-by-step process:**\n\n1. We see that the \"salary\" column represents the salary information.\n2. All salary values seem to be numerical already (no explicit currency signs or string formats are visible), so no conversion appears necessary.\n3.
