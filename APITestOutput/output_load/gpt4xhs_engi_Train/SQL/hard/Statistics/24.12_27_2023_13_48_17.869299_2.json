Inconsistent Data: The dataset might have inconsistencies, such as different notations for gender (e.g., 'F', 'female', 'Woman') or missing data, which can make it difficult to accurately count the number of females.\n\n2. Data Formatting: If the data is not formatted correctly or uniformly (e.g., mixed cases like 'Female', 'FEMALE', 'female'), the parser may need to be case-insensitive or require additional logic to standardize the data before counting.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: The same person might be listed multiple times in the datatable with the same or different keys; if this is not accounted for, it could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n4. Large Datasets: Extremely large datasets could present performance issues, necessitating efficient parsing algorithms to handle the volume of data.\n\n5. Ambiguous Gender Markers: Some entries might use non-binary gender markers or may have ambiguous gender information that does not clearly classify the individual as female.\n\n6. PrimeKey Association: If rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, one needs to ensure that each individual is only counted once, even if they appear on multiple rows.\n\n7. Incorrect Data Entry: Human or machine errors in data entry (e.g., typos) could lead to incorrect classification of gender, affecting the overall count.\n\nTo navigate these obstacles, preprocessing steps such as cleaning, deduplication, and normalization of the dataset might be necessary before attempting to count the number of females in the datatable."
