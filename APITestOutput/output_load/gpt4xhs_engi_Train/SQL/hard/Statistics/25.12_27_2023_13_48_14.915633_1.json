We need to ensure we're comparing numerical values rather than strings.\n\n4. **Duplicate Entries**: The presence of duplicate rows for the same person (indicated by the same primeKey) could skew the count unless deduplication is performed.\n\n5. **Missing Values**: Some entries might have missing or null values for salary, which would have to be handled appropriately to avoid errors in the analysis.\n\n6. **Data Types & Conversion**: We may need to convert data types appropriately before performing numerical comparisons, especially if the data is not initially in a numerical format.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: The datatable might contain errors or outliers in the salary data that could affect the result.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: Depending on the data processing tool or programming language used, we may encounter performance issues that could slow down the parsing and analysis of large datasets.\n\n9. **File Accessibility and Format**: The input file could be in a format that's not easily parsed (e.g., PDF, image scan), or there could be issues with accessing or reading the file due to permissions or corruption.\n\nOnce we define how to handle these potential issues, we can proceed more effectively to parse the datatable and answer the question with accuracy."
