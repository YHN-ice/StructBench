Inconsistent Data Formats: If the gender data is not consistently formatted (e.g., \"female,\" \"Female,\" \"F,\" \"f,\" etc.), it might require additional processing to standardize the information.\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some entries might have missing gender information, which would require a decision on how to handle these cases.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: There may be duplicate rows for the same person with the same primeKey. These duplicates need to be identified and handled to avoid counting the same individual more than once.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: The table might use ambiguous terms or codes to indicate gender, making it difficult to accurately classify entries as female without additional context.\n\n5. Incorrect or Misleading Data: The data could contain errors or be misleading due to incorrect input, which would affect the accuracy of the count.\n\n6. Large Dataset: If the dataset is very large, it may pose performance issues, and efficient parsing strategies would be required to handle the data volume effectively.\n\n7.
