If the data is improperly formatted or has integrity issues, extracting accurate information might be problematic.\n\n2. **Large Datasets**: If the datatable is extensive, parsing through it to find relevant information could be challenging and time-consuming without proper tools or optimized algorithms.\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there might be duplicate entries for individuals with different pieces of information in separate rows. Properly identifying and handling these duplicates is necessary to avoid counting the same person multiple times.\n\n4. **Data Types and Comparisons**: Salary data must be correctly identified as numerical values to perform comparisons. Ensuring that salaries are interpreted as numbers and not as strings or other data types is essential for accurate comparisons.\n\n5. **Efficient Searching**: For large datasets, an efficient searching algorithm or use of indexing is important to quickly find all relevant entries without having to do a full scan of the entire data set.\n\n6. **Filtering Data**: Implementing the correct filter conditions to only consider salaries greater than 177028 is crucial. Logical errors here could lead to incorrect counts.\n\n7. **Handling Missing or Incorrect Data**: There could be missing or incorrectly formatted salary data which needs to be handled gracefully to avoid skewing the results.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the dataset is large, performance could be an issue, and it may require optimizing the parsing process or using more powerful computational resources.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we will need to address these obstacles accordingly to provide an accurate answer."
