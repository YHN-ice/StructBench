        "Based on the provided input, we need to count the number of people with a salary greater than 98995. To do this, we will examine the 'salary' column of the input data and count how many entries have a salary value greater than 98995. Since the salary values are already provided in numerical form without any currency symbols or commas, we can proceed with directly comparing the numbers.\n\nLet's count the number of entries with a salary greater than 98995:\n\n1. a: 265915 (greater than 98995)\n2. b: 917236 (greater than 98995)\n3. c: 971853 (greater than 98995)\n4. d: 777832 (greater than 98995)\n5. e: 636967 (greater than 98995)\n6. f: 274769 (greater than 98995)\n7. g: 779909 (greater than 98995)\n8. h: 215683 (greater than 98995)\n9. i: 731941 (greater than 98995)\n10. j: 846638 (greater than 98995)\n11. k: 280605 (greater than 98995)\n12. l: 738073 (greater than 98995)\n13. m: 461474 (greater than 98995)\n14. n: 107426 (greater than 98995)\n\nAll individuals listed in the provided input have salaries above 98995, so the answer is:\n\n**There are 14 people with salaries greater than 98995.**"
