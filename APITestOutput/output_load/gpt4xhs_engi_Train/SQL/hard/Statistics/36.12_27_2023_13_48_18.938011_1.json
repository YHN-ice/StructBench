Data Consistency: If the data is not consistent (e.g., use of different currency symbols, inclusion of commas in numbers, inconsistent use of decimal points), it could make parsing for numerical values challenging.\n\n3. Column Identification: It may not be immediately clear which column contains the salary information, especially if the datatable has many columns or lacks clear headers.\n\n4. Data Size: If the datatable is very large, it might take a long time to process, or there could be memory issues when trying to load the entire table into memory.\n\n5. PrimeKey Duplication: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there may be duplicate entries for individuals. We need to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n6.
