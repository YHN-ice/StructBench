There might be multiple numerical fields, and selecting the wrong one would result in an incorrect count.\n\n4. **Data Size and Processing Time**: If the datatable is extremely large, it could take a significant amount of time to process all the data, especially if it's not indexed or sorted in a way that allows for efficient querying.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The dataset may contain errors or null values which need to be handled appropriately to avoid skewing the results.\n\n6. **Performance Optimization**: Depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the query, optimizing for performance may be necessary to deliver results in a timely manner.\n\n7. **Accurate Comparison**: Ensuring that all salaries are compared accurately with the threshold value of $125,951, taking into account any potential leading or trailing spaces or other extraneous characters that might interfere with numerical comparison.\n\n8. **Data Type Issues**: Salaries must be interpreted as numerical values rather than strings to perform the greater than comparison.
