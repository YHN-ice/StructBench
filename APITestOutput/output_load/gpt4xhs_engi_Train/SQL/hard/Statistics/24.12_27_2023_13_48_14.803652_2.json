Missing Data: If some rows are missing the gender information, it will be challenging to accurately count the number of females.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: If the datatable does not have a unique identifier for individuals or if there are duplicate entries without a clear way to de-duplicate them, this could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n4.
