        "Based on the input provided, we have a data table that includes a 'primeKey', 'status', and 'salary' among other fields.

From those identified rows, count the number of rows where the 'salary' value is greater than 84461.\n\nLet's now apply these steps to the given data:\n\n- a (employed) - Salary: 172872 (> 84461)\n- b (employed) - Salary: 984773 (> 84461)\n- c (employed) - Salary: 606653 (> 84461)\n- f (employed) - Salary: 262167 (> 84461)\n- g (employed) - Salary: 446485 (> 84461)\n- h (unemployed) - Salary: 466654 (> 84461)\n- i (unemployed) - Salary: 407152 (> 84461)\n- k (employed) - Salary: 257376 (> 84461)\n- l (employed) - Salary: 940458 (> 84461)\n- m (unemployed) - Salary: 692299 (> 84461)\n- n (unemployed) - Salary: 877734 (> 84461)\n\nAll individuals listed above have salaries greater than $84,461.\n\nCounting the individuals, we have a total of **11 people** who work with a salary more than $84,461."
