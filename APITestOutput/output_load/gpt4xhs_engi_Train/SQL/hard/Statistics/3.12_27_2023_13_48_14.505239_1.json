Inconsistent Data: There might be inconsistencies in the data, such as different formats for the salary (e.g., some entries with currency symbols, others without; some with commas in the numbers, others without).\n\n3. Multiple Entries: There might be multiple entries for the same person with different salaries, and it could be challenging to determine which one is the most recent or the correct one to consider.\n\n4. Missing Data: Some rows could have missing or incomplete salary information, which would require a decision on how to handle them (e.g., skip these entries, estimate salary, etc.).\n\n5. Ambiguous Columns: The salary column might not be clearly labeled or could be confused with other numerical columns if the table headers are not clear.\n\n6. Large Dataset: If the dataset is very large, it could take considerable time to parse and analyze it.\n\n7. Data Errors: There could be errors in the data, such as typos or incorrect salaries, which could lead to inaccurate counts.\n\n8.

Non-numeric Salary Data: Salary data could include non-numeric characters that need to be cleaned or processed before comparison (e.g., '$17,103' vs '17103').\n\n10.
