If the salaries are not clearly marked or consistently formatted, it might be hard to extract and compare them.\n\n2. Multiple Entries: If the datatable includes multiple entries for the same person (as indicated by a primeKey), we have to make sure not to double-count individuals.\n\n3. Incomplete Data: Some rows might have missing salary information, which could lead to an inaccurate count if not handled properly.\n\n4. Data Volume: A very large dataset could make the parsing process slow, depending on the method used to process the data.\n\n5. Data Types: Ensuring that the salaries are interpreted as numerical data types rather than strings will be important for comparison purposes.\n\n6. Sorting and Filtering: The ability to sort or filter the data effectively to isolate only those records with salaries above the given threshold.\n\n7. Human Error: Misreading figures, mistyping queries, or incorrectly setting up filters could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\nDealing with these issues often requires careful planning and robust data handling techniques to ensure an accurate result."
