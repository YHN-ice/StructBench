Data Format Consistency: If the datatable contains inconsistent data formats, especially for the salary field, it can be challenging to compare the values correctly.\n\n2. Large Dataset: If the dataset is very large, it may be computationally intensive to process all the data. This could require more efficient parsing algorithms or data handling techniques.\n\n3. Missing or Incorrect Data: Some rows might have missing salary information or incorrect data (such as negative values for salary), which would need to be handled appropriately.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: If there are duplicate rows with the same `primeKey` but different salary information, determining which entry to consider could be challenging.\n\n5. Data Type Conversion: The salary values may be stored as strings and would need to be converted to a numeric type for comparison.\n\n6. Currency Normalization: If the datatable includes salaries in different currencies, conversion to a single currency may be necessary for accurate comparison.\n\n7. Performance Optimization: Depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the query, optimizing for performance may be necessary to ensure timely results.\n\n8. Accessing the Correct Column: Ensuring that the parser is accessing the correct column for 'salary' in case there are many columns with similar or confusing headers.\n\nOnce these potential difficulties are mitigated, it would be possible to parse the datatable and accurately answer how many people work with a salary more than $542,165.
