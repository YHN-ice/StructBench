Duplicate Records: If the dataset contains duplicates (records with the same primeKey), we must ensure not to double-count individuals.\n\n5. Multiple Rows per Person: If each person has multiple rows with different pieces of information, the parser must correctly aggregate information by the primeKey to avoid miscounting.\n\n6.
