Data parsing and extraction: The data must be accurately parsed to extract the relevant information regarding salaries. Errors in data parsing could lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. Data format consistency: If the data is not consistently formatted, especially with regard to how salary figures are represented (e.g., presence of currency symbols, commas, decimal points), it can complicate the parsing process.\n\n3. Dealing with duplicates: Since the same `primeKey` indicates the same person, care must be taken to ensure that individuals are not counted more than once if their information appears in multiple rows.\n\n4. Data type conversion: Salaries might be represented as strings and will need to be converted to numerical values for comparison purposes.\n\n5. Handling missing or invalid data: If there are missing or invalid salary entries, these will need to be appropriately handled to avoid skewing the results.\n\n6. Large datasets: If the dataset is very large, it might present performance issues and require efficient algorithms or methods to process the data.\n\n7. Multiple salary entries per person: If a person has multiple salary entries (e.g., raises over time), it will be important to determine which salary to consider for the comparison.\n\nPlease provide the input file or the datatable so I can proceed with extracting and analyzing the data to provide an accurate answer."
