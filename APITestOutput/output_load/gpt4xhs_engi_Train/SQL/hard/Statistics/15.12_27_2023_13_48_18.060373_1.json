For example, salaries might be listed with or without commas or other formatting characters.\n\n2. **Data Size**: If the datatable is very large, processing the data might be time-consuming, and it might be challenging to handle it efficiently without specialized tools or optimized code.\n\n3. **Duplicate Records**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we must ensure not to count the same individual more than once if their salary is listed multiple times.\n\n4. **PrimeKey Identification**: Identifying and correctly handling the primeKey is crucial to avoid counting duplicates. It's important to recognize whether the primeKey refers to an individual's identifier or something else.\n\n5. **Missing or Incorrect Data**: There could be missing or incorrect salary data, which would affect the accuracy of the answer.\n\n6. **Data Interpretation**: Salaries could be listed in different currencies or include additional compensation not counted as base salary (like stock options or bonuses), which may require clarification or additional context to interpret correctly.\n\n7. **Textual vs. Numeric Data**: Salaries might be listed in a textual format that requires conversion to numeric values for comparison.\n\n8. **Programming Limitations**: Depending on the implementation, there might be limitations in the programming or scripting language used for parsing, such as handling large numbers or text processing capabilities.\n\nOvercoming these obstacles will require careful consideration of the data structure, use of appropriate parsing methods, and possibly some data cleaning or transformation steps to ensure accuracy in the count of individuals with salaries above the specified amount."
