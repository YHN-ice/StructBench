These need to be identified and handled correctly to avoid overcounting.\n\n4. **Ambiguous Gender Markers**: Some entries might have non-standard or ambiguous gender markers that do not clearly indicate the person's gender as female.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity**: The database might have case sensitivity issues where genders are inputted in various cases like \"female\", \"Female\", or \"FEMALE\". The parser must handle all cases uniformly.\n\n6. **Data Spanning Multiple Columns**: Gender information could be spread across multiple columns, requiring aggregation of data from different fields to determine an individual's gender.\n\n7. **Different Languages or Typos**: The dataset might include gender information in different languages or have typographical errors that could lead to misinterpretation unless standardized.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties would require careful preprocessing and cleaning of the data, as well as robust logic to handle various cases of gender representation.
