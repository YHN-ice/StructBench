Ambiguous or Non-binary Gender Designations: The dataset might include non-binary, transgender, or other gender designations that don't fit strictly into 'male' or 'female' categories, requiring clarification on which categories should be included in the count.\n\n5. Duplication of Records: If there are duplicate records for the same individual, it would be important to identify and count each individual only once.\n\n6.
