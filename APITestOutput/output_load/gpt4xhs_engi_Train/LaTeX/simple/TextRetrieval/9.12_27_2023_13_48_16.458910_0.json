The most common is `\\textbf{}` but there are also other commands such as `\\bf{}` (deprecated) or custom commands defined in the preamble that could be used to make text bold.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Sometimes, the bold command might be nested inside other commands or have other formatting commands nested within it. Extracting the text while preserving the correct order and nesting can be challenging.\n\n3. **Inline Math Mode**: If the bold text is within an inline math mode (delimited by `$` signs), the parser needs to handle this differently, since math mode has its own set of formatting commands.\n\n4. **Environment Scopes**: Text could be made bold within a particular environment scope, like `itemize` or `enumerate`. The parser should correctly identify bold text within these environments without confusion.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. The parser must ignore text within these comments, even if they contain what looks like formatting commands.\n\n6. **Custom Macros**: A LaTeX document might define custom macros that encapsulate the bold command. The parser needs to recognize and expand these macros accordingly.\n\n7. **Incomplete Tags**: Sometimes a LaTeX document may have errors or incomplete tags which could make parsing difficult.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Bracing**: Braces are used to delimit the scope of the command; however, sometimes they may be inconsistently used or missing, which could complicate parsing.\n\n9. **Document Class and Packages**: Depending on the document class and additional packages used, there could be variations in how bold text is created that the parser needs to account for.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, the parser must handle all these cases correctly. Now, please provide the LaTeX input file so that I can proceed with extracting the bold texts."
