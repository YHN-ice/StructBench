These options are typically placed inside brackets before the file path and need to be properly ignored to extract the filename.\n\n5. **Commented out lines**: Parts of the LaTeX code, including figure inclusion commands, might be commented out with `%`, which means they shouldn't be considered as they are not actual inclusions in the final document.\n\n6. **Custom commands or environments**: The LaTeX document could define custom commands or environments that abstract away the figure inclusion process, making direct parsing for standard commands insufficient.\n\n7. **Multiple figures in one command**: Commands like `\\includegraphics` can sometimes be used inside other environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, or custom ones) that may contain multiple figures.\n\n8. **Environment encapsulation**: Figures might be included within LaTeX environments, which could complicate the extraction process if only considering lines outside of these environments.\n\n9. **Line breaks and concatenation**: The LaTeX syntax allows for line breaks and concatenation using `%` at the end of the line, which could disrupt straightforward line-by-line parsing.\n\n10. **Encoding and character issues**: Special characters or encodings in filenames might require proper handling to ensure correct extraction.\n\nTo overcome these issues, a parser needs to be robust, context-aware, and capable of handling LaTeX's flexible syntax accurately."
