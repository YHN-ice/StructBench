The parser must correctly identify the file name in both cases.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: The figures could have various file extensions or no extension specified at all (LaTeX can automatically determine the appropriate file type).\n\n4. **Comments**: Figures included in comments should not be extracted since they are not actually used in the document.\n\n5. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have optional arguments that could complicate the extraction of the file name.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Some LaTeX packages allow including multiple figures with a single command, which could make the parsing more complex.\n\n7. **Nested Includes**: Figures might be included within other files that are included in the LaTeX document, requiring recursive parsing.\n\n8. **Environment Wrappers**: Figures might be wrapped in environments like `figure`, `minipage`, etc., and the parser must handle these cases correctly.\n\n9. **Macros and Commands Redefinition**: If the LaTeX document defines new macros or redefines existing commands that are used to include figures, this might affect the parsing process.\n\n10. **Encoding and Special Characters**: Special characters or encoding issues in file paths could lead to difficulties in correctly identifying the figure file names.\n\nWith these potential difficulties in mind, I'm ready to attempt to extract the figure file names from the given LaTeX input file.
