The parser must recognize all possible commands that can be used to include images.\n\n2. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command may have options that alter how the image is displayed (e.g., scale, width, height, angle). These options are usually inside square brackets before the file name and must be correctly parsed and ignored to extract the file name.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: LaTeX does not require the file extension to be specified when including an image. The parser may need to handle cases where the extension is omitted or consider multiple possible extensions for each file name.\n\n4. **File Paths**: Image files might be located in different directories, so the parser must correctly handle relative and absolute paths.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. A line with a comment that includes something that looks like an image inclusion command should not be processed.\n\n6. **Multiple Files in One Command**: Rarely, but possibly, a command might include multiple files. The parser should be able to handle such cases if they occur.\n\n7. **Curly Braces**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to enclose mandatory arguments like the file name in `\\includegraphics{file}`. Nested curly braces or incorrectly matched braces may complicate parsing.\n\n8. **Environments and Macros**: Sometimes the image file may be included inside a custom command or LaTeX environment, which would require parsing these structures properly.\n\n9. **Figures Wrapped in Floats**: Figures are often wrapped in `figure` environments or other floating environments. The parser must identify the inclusion command within these environments.\n\n10. **Non-standard Inclusion**: There might be user-defined macros or less common packages for including graphics that could differ from standard `\\includegraphics`.\n\nTo correctly extract all included figure files, the parser must address these potential issues efficiently."
