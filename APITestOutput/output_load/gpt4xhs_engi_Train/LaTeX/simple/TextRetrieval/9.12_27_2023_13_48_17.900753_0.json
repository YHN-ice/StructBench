I need to identify all possible commands that can make text bold.\n\n2. Nested Commands: LaTeX allows for commands to be nested within one another. If a bold command is nested inside another command, or vice versa, I will need to correctly parse the nested structure to extract the bold text.\n\n3. Custom Commands: Users can define their own commands in LaTeX, which could potentially be used to apply bold formatting. Identifying such custom commands without additional context can be challenging.\n\n4. Comments and Environment Context: Bold text might be within comments or could change depending on the environment (like within a `theorem` environment). These contexts should be properly identified to avoid extracting text that is not actually rendered as bold in the final document.\n\n5. Incomplete or Broken Code: The LaTeX code could be incomplete or contain errors, which might make it difficult to accurately parse the file and identify bold text.\n\n6. Encodings and Special Characters: LaTeX files can include various encodings and special characters, which might require proper handling during text extraction.\n\nTo accurately extract the bold texts, I will need to overcome these obstacles and correctly interpret the LaTeX source code provided."
