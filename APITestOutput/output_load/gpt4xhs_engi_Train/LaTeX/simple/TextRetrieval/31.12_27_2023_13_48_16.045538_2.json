The parser must be able to handle both cases.\n\n3. **Path Notation**: File paths can be relative or absolute, and they might include directories. The parser needs to handle various path notations and extract only the file names if that's what's required.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: In LaTeX, the file extension can be omitted when including a graphic. The parser might need to infer the most likely file type if not specified.\n\n5. **Options in Include Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have options inside square brackets before the file name, which should be ignored when extracting the file name.\n\n6. **Comments**: Part of the LaTeX code might be commented out using `%`. These lines should be ignored as they are not active code.\n\n7. **Multiple Files in One Command**: Although uncommon, there could be custom commands defined that include multiple files at once or use loops to include files, which may be more complex to parse.\n\n8. **Custom Commands and Macros**: The document could define custom commands that wrap the `\\includegraphics` command, which could make extraction more difficult without expanding those macros.\n\n9. **Conditional Inclusion**: There might be conditional statements that include graphics only if certain conditions are met. The parser must consider whether to report filenames within such conditions.\n\n10. **Complex File Names**: Image file names might contain special characters or spaces, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\nTo address these difficulties, the parser must be robust and account for various LaTeX syntaxes and conventions related to including figures."
