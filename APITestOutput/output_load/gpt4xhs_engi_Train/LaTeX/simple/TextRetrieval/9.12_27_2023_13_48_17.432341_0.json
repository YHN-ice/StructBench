The parser must recognize these groupings correctly to avoid extracting incomplete or incorrect text.\n\n6. **Encoded Characters**: Special characters in LaTeX may be encoded (e.g., `&` as `\\&`), which could appear in bold text and might need to be decoded to extract the actual text as it appears in the document.\n\n7. **Multi-line Text**: LaTeX commands can span multiple lines, so the parser must be able to handle multi-line patterns when extracting bold text.\n\n8. **Document Class and Packages**: The behavior of `\\textbf{}` and other formatting commands can be altered by the document class or packages used in the LaTeX file.
