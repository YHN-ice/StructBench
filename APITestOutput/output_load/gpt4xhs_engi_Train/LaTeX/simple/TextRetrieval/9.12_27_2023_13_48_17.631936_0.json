Different commands for bold: LaTeX has multiple ways to make text bold, including `\\textbf{}`, `\\bf{}`, and `\\bfseries`. Each of these would need to be recognized and handled properly.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text commands may be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. Incomplete commands: Sometimes LaTeX files have syntax errors or incomplete commands, such as missing braces `{}` for `\\textbf`. This might lead to incorrectly parsed content or failures in the extraction process.\n\n4. Custom commands: A LaTeX document might define custom commands that internally use one of the bold commands. Without knowledge of these custom commands, it could be difficult to identify bold text correctly.\n\n5. Multiple lines: Bold text in LaTeX can span multiple lines or even paragraphs, so the parser would need to handle multiline cases.\n\n6. Comments: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. If a bold command is commented out, it shouldn't be extracted as it is not part of the compiled document output.\n\n7. Special characters and formatting: Within the bold text, there might be special characters (like &, $, #) or other formatting commands (like italics or underline) that should be ignored or handled separately when extracting just the raw bold text.\n\n8. Environment-dependent: Bold text within certain environments may require special handling, such as within `figure`, `table`, or custom-defined environments.\n\nRecognizing and addressing these challenges is crucial for accurate extraction of bold text from a LaTeX file."
