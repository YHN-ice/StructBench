Different commands for bold text: In LaTeX, boldface text can be formatted using various commands such as `\\textbf{}`, `\\bf{}`, or even within custom commands defined by the user. Therefore, the parser must be able to recognize all possible ways bold text could be encoded.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text in LaTeX can be nested within other text formatting commands or environments, making it challenging to extract only the bold part without including other styles.\n\n3. Parameter braces matching: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to enclose parameters, and these braces should properly match. Extracting text requires recognizing paired braces, which can be difficult if there are nested braces or if the braces are used in different contexts (e.g., within math environments or as literal characters).\n\n4. Conditional formatting and custom commands: Some documents may apply bold formatting conditionally using custom commands or even within macros. These cases require an understanding of the custom commands and macros to accurately extract the bold text.\n\n5. Comments and inactive code: LaTeX comments start with `%` and any text following this character on the same line is ignored by LaTeX. Bold text inside comments should not be extracted.\n\n6. Escaped characters: Special characters like `{`, `}`, and `\\` might be escaped in the LaTeX document (e.g., `\\{`, `\\}`, `\\\\`). The parser should treat these correctly and not confuse them with markup for formatting.\n\n7. Multiple formats in one command: A command may contain multiple formatting options, such as `\\textbf{\\textit{Bold and italic}}`. The parser must handle such cases to extract only the bold text.\n\nFor an accurate extraction, the parser must be well-designed to handle these complexities."
