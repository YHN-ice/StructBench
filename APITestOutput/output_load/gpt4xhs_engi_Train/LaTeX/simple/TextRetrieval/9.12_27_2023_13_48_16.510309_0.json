Different Commands for Bold: LaTeX has multiple commands for making text bold, such as `\\textbf{...}`, `\\bf{...}`, or even custom-defined commands in the preamble. We need to account for all these possibilities.\n\n2. Nested Commands: Bold text might be nested inside other formatting commands like italics `\\textit{...}`, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. Braces within Text: If there are braces `{}` within the bold text itself, this can complicate parsing because it may not be clear where the bold command ends.\n\n4. Line Breaks and Whitespace: There could be line breaks, comments, or additional whitespace within the bold command that need to be handled correctly.\n\n5. Environment-based Formatting: Bold text might be part of an environment like `\\begin{theorem}...\\end{theorem}`, where the entire content is rendered in bold. This requires identifying and parsing such environments.\n\n6. Custom Macros: A document might define custom macros that encapsulate `\\textbf`, requiring an understanding of these macros to correctly extract bold text.\n\n7. Incomplete or Broken Commands: In cases of malformed LaTeX code (e.g., missing closing braces), parsing can become difficult or impossible without manual intervention.\n\n8. External Files: Sometimes LaTeX documents use `\\input{...}` or `\\include{...}` to pull in content from other files, which might contain bold text not present in the main file being parsed.\n\nBefore starting the extraction process, it would be important to clarify which of these potential issues are in play, and what version or conventions of LaTeX we are assuming for this task."
