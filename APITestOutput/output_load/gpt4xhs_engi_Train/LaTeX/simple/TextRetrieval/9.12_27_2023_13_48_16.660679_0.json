Identifying Bold Commands: LaTeX typically uses the `\\textbf{...}` command for bold text, but it might also use the `\\bfseries` command in some cases or a custom command defined in the preamble that alters text to be bold.\n\n2. Nested Commands: Bold text might be nested within other LaTeX commands, such as within a section heading or a list item, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. Handling Braces: The braces `{}` are used in LaTeX to delimit the scope of commands. Balancing and correctly parsing these braces are essential to extract the correct text.\n\n4. Custom Environments: Bold text may be inside custom environments or user-defined macros, which would require understanding those definitions to properly extract the bold text.\n\n5. Conditional Text: There might be conditional statements (e.g., `\\if... \\fi`) that affect whether text is bolded, depending on certain conditions.\n\n6. Comments: Comments in LaTeX begin with `%` and are ignored by LaTeX processors. If there are commented-out sections with bold commands, they should not be included in the extraction.\n\n7. Multiple Files: A LaTeX project may span multiple files with `\\input` or `\\include` commands, though this may not be relevant if we're only considering a single file.\n\nIf provided with an input file, the exact method of extraction will depend on how the bold text is encoded within that file."
