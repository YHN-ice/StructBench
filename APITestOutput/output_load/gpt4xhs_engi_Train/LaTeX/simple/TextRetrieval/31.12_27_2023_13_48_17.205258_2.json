The parser must handle both cases.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Figures might be included using relative paths (`figures/img.png`), absolute paths (`/home/user/documents/img.png`), or just file names (`img.png`). Paths can also include `..` to reference parent directories.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Commands like `\\includegraphics` might be used inside figure environments along with other commands which could have multiple files included in one line, such as in subfigure environments.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. The parser should ignore anything that is commented out.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can take optional arguments that modify the image being included (like scale, width, height, rotation, etc.). These are usually within square brackets before the curly braces that contain the file name.\n\n7. **File Name Spaces**: Sometimes filenames or paths may include spaces. If not properly handled, this could lead to incomplete or incorrect extraction of file names.\n\n8. **Complex Environments**: Images may be included inside complex environments like `figure`, `minipage`, or custom-defined environments which may require specific parsing rules.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, a robust LaTeX file parser will need to carefully consider each case to correctly extract all figure file names."
