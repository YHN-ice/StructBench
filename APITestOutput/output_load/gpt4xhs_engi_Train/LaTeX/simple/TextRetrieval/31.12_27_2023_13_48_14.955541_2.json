The parser must handle cases both with and without file extensions.\n\n4. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command allows for optional arguments that can be specified in square brackets before the file name. The parser must correctly ignore these when extracting the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX files may contain comments, indicated by the `%` character. If a figure inclusion command is commented out, it should not be counted as an included figure.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: Sometimes, LaTeX users include multiple figures in one line. The parser should be able to handle such cases and extract all figure names.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Some LaTeX documents define custom commands or environments to include figures. Unless these are known beforehand, it could be difficult to parse them without additional information.\n\n8. **File Name Special Characters**: LaTeX allows for special characters in file names, which may need to be handled or escaped properly.\n\n9. **Complex File Names**: File names could have complex patterns, including additional braces or other LaTeX commands embedded within them.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a parser that is robust and can handle a variety of LaTeX coding styles and scenarios."
