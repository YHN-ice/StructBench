We need to recognize all possible syntaxes for bold text.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text within LaTeX may contain other formatting commands or environments, which can complicate the extraction process. For instance, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{emphasized} text}` contains emphasized text inside bold text.\n\n3. **Custom commands and environments**: The LaTeX file might define custom commands or environments that result in bold text, but do not explicitly use the standard bold commands. Understanding these requires parsing the preamble and any additional package or command definitions.\n\n4. **Comments and inactive code**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` character. Bold text within comments should not be extracted as it is not part of the compiled document.\n\n5. **Conditional text**: LaTeX can include conditional expressions that may or may not render text in bold depending on certain conditions. This can make it difficult to determine what text is actually bold.\n\n6. **Braces matching**: Braces `{}` denote grouping in LaTeX, and it's important to correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the complete bold text segment.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a careful parsing approach that respects the structure of LaTeX commands and environments, and possibly a full understanding of the LaTeX file's preamble and any custom definitions it may contain."
