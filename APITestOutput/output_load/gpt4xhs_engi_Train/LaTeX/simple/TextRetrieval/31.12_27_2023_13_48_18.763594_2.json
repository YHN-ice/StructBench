LaTeX is often configured to find the best match if no extension is provided.\n\n3. **Relative and absolute paths**: Figures might be included using relative or absolute paths, which affects how the file name should be interpreted.\n\n4. **Figure options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options preceding the file name which might make regex-based parsing more complex.\n\n5. **Comments and non-standard LaTeX commands**: Comments in the LaTeX files (lines starting with `%`) might contain lines that look like figure include commands but are not actually used. Additionally, there might be custom commands defined in the document that encapsulate the figure inclusion within them.\n\n6. **Multiple figures in one command**: Some LaTeX packages allow including multiple figures within a single command, possibly separated by commas or other characters.\n\n7. **File name with spaces or special characters**: File names might contain spaces or special characters, which could complicate regex-based parsing.\n\n8. **Conditional Inclusion**: Figures could be included conditionally using LaTeX if statements, which could make it difficult to determine whether a figure should be included based on parsing alone.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, parsing the file correctly requires careful consideration of LaTeX syntax and possible variations in how figures are included.
