Identifying all possible commands used to denote bold text is essential.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands, making the parsing and extraction process more complex. For example, `\\textbf{This is \\emph{bold and emphasized} text}`.\n\n3. **Environment-based Formatting**: Bold text might be defined within environments that change the formatting of their content, like `\\begin{theorem}\\end{theorem}` where the content is typically set to bold by default. Recognizing these environments is necessary.\n\n4. **Custom Macros and Styles**: Users can define their custom macros that toggle bold formatting. Without knowing these user-defined commands, it's challenging to extract bold text correctly.\n\n5. **Comments and Conditional Text**: Comments (using `%`) and conditionally included text (using `\\iffalse ... \\fi`) can contain bold commands which are not actually used in the final document. It's important to ignore these sections.\n\n6. **Text Concatenation**: Bold text could be split across lines or concatenated with non-bold text, requiring careful parsing to extract only the bold parts without losing context.\n\n7. **Package Use**: Certain LaTeX packages may provide additional ways to set text in bold, or modify the behavior of standard bold commands, thus the need to understand package-specific syntax.\n\n8. **Document Structure**: Bold text may appear in headers, footers, captions, etc., requiring a parser to understand the document structure to extract all instances correctly.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, extraction requires careful parsing and an understanding of the LaTeX syntax rules and document structure."
