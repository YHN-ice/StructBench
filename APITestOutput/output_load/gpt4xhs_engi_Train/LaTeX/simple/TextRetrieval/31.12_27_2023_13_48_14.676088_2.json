They might also omit file extensions if using LaTeX's default behavior of guessing the appropriate graphic file type.\n\n3. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command allows for optional arguments to be passed in brackets before the file name which can modify the behavior of how the figure is included, such as scaling or rotation.\n\n4. **Multiple figures in one command**: LaTeX allows for subfigures or multiple figures included within one figure environment, potentially with one `\\includegraphics` command.\n\n5. **Comments**: Lines or parts of lines starting with `%` are comments and should be ignored when parsing for figure file names.\n\n6. **Custom commands and environments**: Users can define their own commands and environments which could encapsulate figure inclusion, making it harder to identify without evaluating those custom definitions.\n\n7. **Conditional inclusion**: The content might be conditionally included depending on certain flags or commands which would be challenging to evaluate without a full LaTeX interpreter.\n\n8. **File name with spaces**: While not recommended, some users may include files with spaces in the name which would need special handling to correctly identify the file names.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we would need to carefully parse the file, potentially looking for specific inclusion commands and handling various edge cases as needed."
