Bold text could be specified using multiple commands (\\textbf, \\bfseries, etc.), and these commands can be nested within other environments or custom commands defined in the document.\n\n2. **Custom Macros**: Users can define their own macros that change how bold text is managed. This means that without knowing the definitions of these macros, it's difficult to extract all the bold text correctly.\n\n3. **Conditional Statements**: LaTeX allows for conditional formatting. Text might only be bold under certain conditions set by the document's logic (using \\if..., \\newif, etc.).\n\n4. **Environment Usage**: Bold text could be inside various environments that affect how the text is displayed. For example, theorems or sections could be bold by default, and these environment definitions would need to be understood.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Comments (% symbol) or inactive code (using \\iffalse...\\fi) might contain the appearance of bold commands that are not actually used to format text in the final document.\n\n6. **Multiple Files and Inputs**: A LaTeX project might span multiple files with input commands (\\input, \\include) that bring in additional content from other files. Without access to those files, it's impossible to extract all the bold text.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, to extract all bold texts accurately, we'd need a robust parsing approach capable of understanding the specific syntax, macro definitions, and environments used in the LaTeX source file provided.
