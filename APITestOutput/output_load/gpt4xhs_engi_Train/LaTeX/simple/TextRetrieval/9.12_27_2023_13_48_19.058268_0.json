Identifying all possible commands used for making text bold is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text may have other formatting nested within it, such as italics, underlines, colors, etc. Handling nested commands without losing the bold text information can be challenging.\n\n3. **Environment Conflicts**: Bold text might be within different environments (like `itemize`, `enumerate`, `figure`, `table`, etc.) that could affect how the text is parsed.\n\n4. **Comments and Escaped Characters**: Some bold commands might be commented out or have special characters escaped, which means they shouldn't be treated as actual bold text in the document's output.\n\n5. **Custom Macros**: The LaTeX file might define custom macros that result in bold text, which would require parsing of the macro definitions to properly extract the bold text.\n\n6. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands**: In some cases, there might be errors in the LaTeX file where the bold commands are incomplete or malformed, which could make it difficult to parse the text correctly.\n\n7. **Parsing Algorithm Complexity**: Depending on the parsing approach, it might be difficult to correctly identify and separate out the bold text, especially if we're avoiding regular expressions and relying on a more basic string manipulation technique.\n\n8. **Line Breaks and White Spaces**: Handling line breaks and white spaces correctly to ensure that the extracted text reflects what is actually displayed in the formatted document.\n\nEach of these issues requires a careful approach to ensure accurate and complete extraction of all bold texts from the LaTeX file."
