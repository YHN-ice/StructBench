In LaTeX, this is commonly done with the `\\includegraphics` command, which is usually within a figure environment but can also appear outside of it. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. Multiple Graphics Inclusion Commands: A LaTeX document can have various commands to include graphics such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, or even custom commands defined by the user. Identifying all these possibilities might be a challenge.\n\n2. Complex File Paths: The file names in the `\\includegraphics` command might have complex relative or absolute paths, which could involve parsing directory structures.\n\n3. Optional Arguments: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that change how the image is displayed (like scale, width, height, angle, etc.). These options can appear before the file name and might complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. File Extension Omission: LaTeX allows omitting file extensions in the `\\includegraphics` command. The parser must handle cases where the file extension is not provided and infer or search for the correct file.\n\n5. Commented Out Code: Sometimes, lines including figure inclusion commands might be commented out using the `%` symbol. The parser should ignore such lines.\n\n6. Custom Commands and Environments: Users may define custom commands or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics`. Unless these are standardized or well-documented, it may be challenging to recognize and extract file names from these structures.\n\n7. Encapsulation in Other Commands: File names might be passed as arguments to other commands or macros before being used in `\\includegraphics`, which would require the parser to resolve these before extracting the actual file names.\n\n8. Non-standard Document Classes or Packages: If the document uses non-standard classes or packages that redefine or provide alternatives to `\\includegraphics`, these need to be accounted for.\n\n9. Multi-file LaTeX Projects: In projects split across multiple files, the figures might be included in files that are themselves included in the main LaTeX file with `\\input` or `\\include`. Keeping track of such a structure might be necessary.\n\n10. Conditional Compilation: Some documents use conditional compilation (with `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`) which may include or exclude different figures based on certain conditions. The parser needs to consider which branches are active.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties can help prepare for an effective parsing strategy to accurately extract all figure file names from the"
