Extracting text may require handling a variety of commands and environments.\n\n2. **Custom Commands**: Users can define their own commands in LaTeX, which could change how text is formatted. For instance, a user might define a command that wraps text in bold formatting, but it may not be immediately apparent without looking at the command definition.\n\n3. **Multiple Ways to Bold Text**: There are multiple ways to make text bold in LaTeX. The most common command is `\\textbf{}`, but users could also use `\\bf{}`, `\\bfseries` in combination with a group of text, or even custom-defined commands.\n\n4. **Nested Commands**: Bold text could be nested within other commands, such as within a section heading or in a list item.\n\n5. **Environments**: Some environments might change how text is parsed or displayed, including how bold text is handled.\n\n6. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Portions of the LaTeX code might be commented out or otherwise inactive, which should not be counted in the output.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Special characters that are escaped (e.g., `\\$` to display the dollar sign) should be handled properly so they don't interfere with command parsing.\n\n8. **Conditional Formatting**: Some text might only be bolded conditionally, such as within an `\\if` statement, which could make consistent extraction trickier.\n\n9. **Text Spanning Multiple Lines**: Some bold text might span multiple lines or even pages, making it necessary to handle line breaks and page breaks correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would typically use a LaTeX parser that is capable of understanding the structure of a LaTeX document, identifying the different commands and environments, and extracting the desired text with the correct formatting applied."
