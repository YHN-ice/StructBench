The parser needs to handle such cases.\n\n4. **Command options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that change the figure's appearance (like scale, width, height, etc.), and these options could be present before the actual file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: Lines or parts of lines commented out with `%` should be ignored, as they don't contribute to the final document and thus the file name in the comment should not be extracted.\n\n6. **Custom commands or environments**: The LaTeX document might define custom commands or environments that internally include graphics.
