It can be absolute or relative, and it can use different directory separators (forward slash `/` or backslash `\\\\` for Windows paths).\n3. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX documents may include the file extension when specifying the image file, while others may omit it, relying on LaTeX to find the correct file type.\n4. **Options in Include Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command may contain options before the file name, such as scaling and rotation parameters, which need to be properly ignored to extract the file name.\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. If a figure include command is commented out, it should not be considered.\n6. **Complex Curly Brace Structures**: The file name could be nested within curly braces alongside other commands or parameters, thus requiring correct parsing to extract just the file name.\n7. **Non-standard Macros or Environments**: Some LaTeX documents define custom macros or environments that wrap standard figure inclusion commands, potentially obfuscating the actual commands.\n\nOne strategy to efficiently extract figure file names is to search for lines containing the `\\includegraphics` command (or other relevant commands), ignore lines that are comments, and then use regular expressions or string processing techniques to extract the file path and name while handling the various potential issues listed above."
