The parser needs to handle all possible variations.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands can be nested within other formatting commands or environments. For instance, bold text might be inside an italic text command or a custom macro. Properly extracting the bold text requires handling such nesting correctly.\n\n3. **Braces and Scope**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to define the scope of commands. Sometimes braces can be used within the text for grouping without any commands, which can complicate the parsing.\n\n4. **Comments**: Comment lines starting with `%` should be ignored, as they do not produce output.\n\n5. **Custom Commands**: LaTeX allows users to define their own commands which could change how text is formatted. For example, `\\newcommand{\\mybold}[1]{\\textbf{#1}}` would require the parser to understand that `\\mybold{...}` should also be treated as bold text.\n\n6. **Environments**: Text could be bold within environments (like `itemize`, `enumerate`, etc.), where the scope of bold might be less obvious due to environment-specific formatting.\n\n7. **TeX Primitives**: Some users might use TeX primitives like `\\bf` which are even more context-dependent than LaTeX macros.\n\n8. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands**: In some cases, the LaTeX file might have errors or incomplete commands, which can lead to incorrect parsing if not handled properly.\n\nAll these points should be considered when parsing a LaTeX file to ensure we correctly identify and extract all instances of bold text."
