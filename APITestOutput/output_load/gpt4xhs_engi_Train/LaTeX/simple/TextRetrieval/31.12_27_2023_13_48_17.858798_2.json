Paths may contain directories, which should be correctly parsed.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX commands specify the file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`), while others omit it, relying on the LaTeX engine to search for common extensions. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n4. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command may have optional arguments before the filename, which the parser needs to correctly ignore to extract the filename.\n\n5. **Comments**: Figures might be commented out with `%`. These should be ignored as they aren't included in the final document.\n\n6. **Commands in Preamble or Macros**: If filenames are defined in the preamble or inside LaTeX macros, it could be more difficult to associate the file name with the include command.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes a single command might include multiple files (e.g., using `\\foreach` in LaTeX), which would require more complex parsing.\n\n8. **Environment Considerations**: Figures might be included inside environments (like `figure` or `minipage`), and the parser needs to correctly identify the file inclusion within these contexts.\n\nLet's now take a look at the input LaTeX file to identify the figure filenames."
