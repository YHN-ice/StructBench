For example, someone could define a command that makes text bold, but it wouldn't be the standard `\\textbf{}` command.\n\n3. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands can be nested within other commands or environments, which makes parsing more difficult.\n\n4. **Variety in Formatting**: There are different ways to make text bold in LaTeX, for example, `\\textbf{}`, `\\bfseries`, or even using custom packages.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Text that appears to be bold in the LaTeX source might be commented out or part of an inactive block of code, and thus not actually bold when the document is compiled.\n\nConsidering these challenges, a LaTeX parser must carefully handle these scenarios to ensure accurate extraction of bold text.
