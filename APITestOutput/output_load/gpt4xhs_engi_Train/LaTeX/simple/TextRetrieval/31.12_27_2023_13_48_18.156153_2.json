The parser must handle all common methods of including figures.\n\n2. **File path variations**: The file paths of included figures could be specified with absolute or relative paths and may omit the file extension. The parser must correctly identify the file name irrespective of these variations.\n\n3. **Comments and conditionals**: Figures might be commented out using `%` or conditionally included with `\\iffalse ... \\fi`. The parser should ignore these cases.\n\n4. **Multi-line commands**: LaTeX commands can be split across lines. The parser must correctly handle file names that are broken across lines.\n\n5. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command may have optional arguments that specify the width, height, or other attributes of the figure. The parser needs to distinguish between optional arguments and the file name.\n\n6. **Custom commands and macros**: Users may define custom macros that internally use `\\includegraphics` or similar commands to include figures. The parser must either recognize these macros or be told to ignore them.\n\n7. **Graphics packages**: Different LaTeX packages may offer additional ways to include graphics (e.g., `pgf`, `tikz`).
