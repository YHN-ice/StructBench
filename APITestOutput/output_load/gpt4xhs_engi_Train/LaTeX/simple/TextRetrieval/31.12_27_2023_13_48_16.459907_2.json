Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Multiple Commands**: LaTeX provides different commands to include graphics such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, and sometimes custom commands defined by the user. The parser must recognize all relevant commands.\n\n2. **File Paths**: Figures could be included with relative or absolute paths and may or may not include the file extension. The parser needs to handle all these variations to extract the correct file names.\n\n3. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options that change its behavior, and these options can be included in square brackets before the file name. The parser must correctly distinguish between options and the file name.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments in the code using `%`. Any file names within comments should not be considered as included files.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple files, especially in the case of subfigures or custom commands that loop through files.\n\n6. **Environment Context**: Figures could be included within different environments, like `figure`, `minipage`, or even user-defined environments, which may affect how they're parsed.\n\n7. **File Name Variations**: The same file might be included with variations in the path or file name (e.g., with a different extension or in a different directory), which may lead to duplicate listings if not handled properly.\n\n8. **Conditionals**: Conditional statements in LaTeX (e.g., `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`) could conditionally include figures, which may complicate the parsing.\n\nGiven these challenges, the parser must be robust enough to handle various LaTeX constructs while accurately identifying and extracting the figure file names."
