This can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Environment Blocks:** Bold text might be within an environment block like `\\begin{itemize}` for a bullet list or `\\begin{theorem}` for theorems, which could have its own styling rules.\n\n4. **Comments:** Comments in LaTeX use the `%` symbol. If a bold command is commented out, it should not be considered as part of the document text.\n\n5. **Command Parameters:** Some commands may have optional parameters that affect how you parse the content. For example, `\\textbf[optional]{bold text}` might require additional parsing logic to handle the optional parameters.\n\n6. **In-line vs Block Elements:** Bold text may appear inline within a paragraph or as part of a block element like section headers. This can affect how the text should be extracted and displayed.\n\n7. **Custom Commands:** The document may define custom commands that change the default behavior of `\\textbf`, or define a new command for bold text altogether.\n\n8. **Braces Within Text:** Braces `{}` are used to delimit the scope of LaTeX commands but may also appear within the text for various reasons, which might require careful handling during parsing.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, a parser would need to address these challenges by correctly identifying and handling each case where bold text occurs.\n"
