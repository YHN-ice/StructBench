These should not be considered as they are not active in the final document.\n\n6. **Multiple figures in one command**: There might be LaTeX commands that include multiple figures at once, such as subfigures or a figure wrapped inside another command/environment.\n\n7. **Custom commands or environments**: The document could define custom commands or environments that internally include graphics, which would require knowledge of these custom definitions to properly parse them.\n\n8. **Text formatting**: File names could be broken over lines or include LaTeX special characters, which might need to be interpreted or filtered out.\n\nBy anticipating these issues, we can tailor the parsing approach to accurately extract the figure file names from the LaTeX input provided."
