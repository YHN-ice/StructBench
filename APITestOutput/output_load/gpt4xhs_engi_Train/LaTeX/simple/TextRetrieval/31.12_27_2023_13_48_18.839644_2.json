The parser must be aware of all these commands.\n2. **File path variations**: The figures could be included with a relative or absolute path, and the paths might include directories.\n3. **File extensions**: Sometimes, LaTeX files include the file extension (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf), and other times they do not. The parser needs to handle both cases.\n4. **Graphics packages**: Different LaTeX packages may handle graphics inclusion differently, so the parser has to be adapted to handle such cases (e.g., `graphicx`, `graphics`).\n5. **Comments**: Figures paths might be commented out in the LaTeX source, and should not be considered as included figures.\n6. **Figure environments**: Figures might be included within different environments (e.g., `figure`, `subfigure`, `minipage`), and the parser needs to identify these environments accurately.\n7. **Multiple figures on one line**: Sometimes, multiple figures might be included on a single line, so the parser must be able to handle this.\n8. **Options in includegraphics**: The `\\includegraphics` command can include options within square brackets before the file name, which should not be confused with the file path or name.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser needs to be robust, with a well-defined set of rules to identify figure inclusions accurately, and it should not be confused by variations in syntax or by commented lines."
