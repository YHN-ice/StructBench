We'd need to consider this case as well.\n\n5. **Comments**: Figure inclusion commands could be commented out with `%`, so we should ignore those lines.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: There could be LaTeX commands that include multiple figures at once, like in a figure matrix or subfigures.\n\n7. **Environment Scopes**: Figure files might be included within different environments, such as `figure`, `minipage`, or `subfigure`.
