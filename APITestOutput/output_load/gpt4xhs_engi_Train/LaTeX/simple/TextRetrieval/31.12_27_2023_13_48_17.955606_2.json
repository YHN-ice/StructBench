These should not be counted as included figures.\n5. **Custom Macros**: If the LaTeX file uses custom macros to include figures, it can be challenging to parse without knowing what those macros expand to.\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Some LaTeX packages allow including multiple figures with one command (e.g., subfigures). Parsing such commands might be more complex.\n7. **File Extensions**: LaTeX allows for omitting the file extension when including graphics, but it's also possible that multiple files with the same base name but different extensions exist. The parser needs to handle these cases correctly.\n\nAfter identifying these potential issues, we can proceed more carefully when parsing the LaTeX file to extract figure file names."
