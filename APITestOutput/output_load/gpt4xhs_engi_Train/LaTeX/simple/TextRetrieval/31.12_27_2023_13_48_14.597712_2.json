The parser needs to recognize all possible commands used for including images.\n\n2. **Path specification**: Images can be included with relative or absolute paths, and the path can contain various directories. The parser needs to correctly identify the file name amidst the path specification.\n\n3. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments for scaling, rotating, etc., which might make it harder to identify the actual file name.\n\n4. **Multiple images in one command**: Sometimes a single command might be used to include multiple images, especially within figures that have subfigures.\n\n5. **Commented out lines**: Parts of the LaTeX document may be commented out, including figures. The parser should ignore commented out lines to avoid extracting file names that aren't actually used in the document.\n\n6. **Custom commands and environments**: The user might define custom commands or environments that wrap around the standard image inclusion commands, making it difficult to extract the image names unless these customizations are accounted for.\n\n7. **File extensions**: Images might be included with or without file extensions, and the parser might need to handle different file types (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf).\n\n8. **Special characters in file names**: LaTeX might use special characters in file names, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n9. **Inline vs. display graphics**: The figures might be included inline with text or as a separate display element, which might require different parsing strategies.\n\n10. **File encoding and special LaTeX constructs**: If the LaTeX file uses special encoding or includes constructs like conditionals (`\\if` statements), this can add complexity to the parsing task.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust parsing strategy that can accommodate the flexible nature of LaTeX image inclusion."
