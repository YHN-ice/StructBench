Recognizing all possible bold commands is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands can be nested within other LaTeX commands or environments, which can complicate the parsing.\n\n3. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX commands use curly braces `{}` to encapsulate arguments. Extracting text requires correctly identifying matching braces, even when they are nested.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Some bold texts might be within comments (using `%`) or in parts of the document that are not active in the final output (such as within `\\iffalse ... \\fi` constructs).\n\n5. **Custom Macros**: A LaTeX file may define custom macros that result in bold text, so without knowledge of these macros, a parser may miss some bold texts.\n\n6. **Special Environments**: Certain LaTeX environments may change how text is interpreted, which could affect whether or not text is rendered as bold.\n\n7. **Inline vs. Display Text**: Bold text might occur within inline text (`\\textbf{...}`) or within display environments like `equation`, `align`, etc., and must be handled accordingly.\n\n8. **Multiple Bold Sections in One Command**: Sometimes, a single `\\textbf` command might contain multiple sections of text which are meant to be parsed individually.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser must successfully navigate these challenges and correctly interpret the LaTeX markup language."
