Identifying all possible commands used for bolding text is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands may be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which can complicate parsing.\n\n3. **Braces Matching**: Since LaTeX uses braces `{}` to define the scope of commands, correctly matching opening and closing braces is crucial, especially if there are nested braces within the text that needs to be extracted.\n\n4. **Custom Commands or Macros**: The document might define custom commands or macros for bold text that are not standard LaTeX commands, which would need to be recognized and handled.\n\n5. **Comments**: Text within comments (`%`) should be ignored as it's not part of the compiled document.\n\n6. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Handling line breaks and whitespace correctly to ensure that the text is extracted as it appears in the source, while also managing LaTeX's handling of line breaks and indentation.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Special characters in LaTeX are often escaped (e.g., `\\%` for percent signs), and care should be taken to handle these correctly when extracting text.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will focus on identifying and extracting the content that is marked as bold according to the standard LaTeX commands.
