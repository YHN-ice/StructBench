The parser needs to recognize all the possible syntax variations.\n\n2. **Path Complexity**: The file paths for figures might include directories, and these directories could have complex names. Parsing the correct file name might involve removing the path or dealing with relative versus absolute paths.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX documents include the file extension when including a figure (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`), while other times they do not. The parser should handle both cases correctly.\n\n4. **Comments and Non-standard Inclusions**: Figures might be commented out in the LaTeX source or included using custom commands defined in the document or in imported packages. These cases should be handled or ignored appropriately.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: A single command might include multiple figures, for example through a loop or a comma-separated list. The parser needs to split these correctly and extract all file names.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: The commands to include figures can have optional arguments that might contain additional settings or parameters that are not part of the file name. The parser must distinguish between optional arguments and the actual file path/name.\n\n7. **File Name Containing Spaces or Special Characters**: If a file name contains spaces or special characters, it might be enclosed in `{}` within the LaTeX command. The parser must properly capture the entire file name.\n\nOnce we see the actual LaTeX input, these challenges will help us to implement more robust parsing logic to accurately extract the figure file names."
