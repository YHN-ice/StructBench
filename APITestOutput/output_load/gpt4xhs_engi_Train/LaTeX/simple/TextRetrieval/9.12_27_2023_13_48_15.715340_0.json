Each variety must be accounted for.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, so the parser would need to correctly identify the bold text within such nests.\n\n3. **Custom macros**: A LaTeX document might define custom macros that result in bold text. Unless these macros are known and accounted for, they might be missed by the parser.\n\n4. **Commented out sections**: Text that is commented out in the LaTeX source should not be extracted, but if the parser does not correctly handle comments, it might extract text that isn't actually displayed in the final document.\n\n5. **Conditional text**: Some bold text may appear only when certain conditions are met (e.g., within an `\\if` statement). The parser will have to evaluate these conditions to determine whether to extract such text.\n\n6. **Complex environments**: Bold text within complex environments or tables may be formatted in a non-standard way, requiring more sophisticated parsing logic.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the parsing algorithm would need to be quite comprehensive and robust to extract all instances of bold text accurately."
