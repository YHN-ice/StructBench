The parser needs to handle both scenarios.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Image files can be included using both relative and absolute paths, and these paths can be complex, involving directories and subdirectories.\n\n4. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that can modify the image, such as scaling and rotation. These arguments are usually within square brackets before the file name and need to be ignored when extracting the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX users might comment out lines, including those that contain the inclusion of figure files. The parser should ignore commented lines.\n\n6. **File Path Spaces**: File paths or names with spaces can be included in LaTeX documents, usually by enclosing the path or name within double quotes or braces.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: LaTeX allows for multiple subfigures within a single figure environment, which could use separate commands to include each subfigure.\n\n8. **Non-standard Macros**: Users might define their own macros that internally include graphics, so unless these macros are expanded or the parser is aware of them, the included figures might be missed.\n\n9. **Graphics Packages**: Different LaTeX documents may use different graphics packages, which could affect the syntax for including images.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, parsing a LaTeX file to correctly extract all included figure files would require careful handling of LaTeX syntax and commands.
