Additionally, escaped characters like `\\{` or `\\}` should not be mistaken for command delimiters.\n\n6. **Custom macros**: The LaTeX document might define custom macros that change the behavior of the `\\textbf` command or introduce new ways to bold text.\n\n7. **Text across multiple lines**: The text within a `\\textbf` command might span across multiple lines, so the parser should be able to handle multiline text blocks.\n\nTo properly parse the bold texts, the solution must handle these potential difficulties."
