We need to account for all such commands that the document might use.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested inside other formatting commands or environments. For example, `\\textbf{\\emph{Some bold and italic text}}` should still result in the bold text being extracted.\n\n3. **Custom commands or macros**: The document might define custom macros that result in bold text. For example, if `\\newcommand{\\mybold}[1]{\\textbf{#1}}` is defined, then `\\mybold{Some text}` should also be extracted as bold.\n\n4. **Comments and conditional text**: Bold text might be within comments or conditional text that isn't always displayed. For example, `% \\textbf{This is a comment}` should not be extracted, and we need to handle LaTeX conditionals properly.\n\n5. **Brace matching**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to delimit the scope of commands. We need to ensure proper matching of braces to extract the full scope of the bold text without including too much or too little.\n\n6. **Environment usage**: Bold text might be within specialized environments that alter text appearance, such as `\\begin{theorem} \\textbf{Theorem Name} ... \\end{theorem}`. We need to be aware of such environments if they affect bold text extraction.\n\n7. **In-line vs. block elements**: Bold text might occur within in-line text or within block elements like sections, captions, etc. We must handle both cases.\n\n8. **Escape characters**: Special characters in LaTeX are often escaped with a backslash, e.g., `\\%`. We need to ensure that we do not interpret these as commands.\n\nTo provide accurate results, the parsing process must correctly handle these situations. Let's now proceed with examining the input file and extracting the bold texts accordingly."
