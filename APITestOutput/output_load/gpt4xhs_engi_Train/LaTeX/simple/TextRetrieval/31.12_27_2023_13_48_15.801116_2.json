These options could be included in square brackets before the file path, which we need to ignore to extract just the file name.\n\n4. **Comments and Conditionals:** Parts of the LaTeX document might be commented out or included within conditional statements, meaning that some figure includes may not actually be active in the final document. Extracting filenames from commented out lines or inactive conditionals could lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Multiple figures in one command:** Sometimes, multiple files are included within a single command (for instance, in a `\\foreach` loop or using comma-separated values within `\\includegraphics`).
