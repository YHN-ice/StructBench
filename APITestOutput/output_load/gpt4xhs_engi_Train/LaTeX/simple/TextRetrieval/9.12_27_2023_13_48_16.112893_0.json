Different commands for bold text: LaTeX has multiple ways to make text bold, such as `\\textbf{}`, `\\bfseries`, or even custom commands defined in the preamble. Each of these needs to be recognized and handled properly.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text commands might be nested inside other commands or environments, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. Braces balancing: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to denote the scope of commands. Matching these correctly, especially in the presence of nested commands, is crucial for correct text extraction.\n\n4. Inline and block elements: Bold text can appear inline with other text or as a separate block (such as within an environment). This could affect how the text is extracted and presented.\n\n5. Custom and complex environments: If the LaTeX file defines custom environments or includes complex environments like tables or figures, bold text within these might require special handling.\n\n6. Comments: Text within comments should not be extracted, but if the comment syntax is not handled properly, it can lead to incorrect extractions.\n\n7. Escape characters: Special characters in LaTeX are often escaped with a backslash. Care must be taken to handle these correctly so that the extracted text is accurate.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help in developing a robust strategy for parsing the LaTeX file and extracting the bold texts correctly.
