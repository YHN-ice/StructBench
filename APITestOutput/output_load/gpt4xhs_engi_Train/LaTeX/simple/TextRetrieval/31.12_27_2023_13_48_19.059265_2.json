Knowing all the possible commands that can be used to include figures is necessary.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: Figures might not always be included with a simple file name; they could have relative or absolute paths, and they might be nested within folders.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX files might include the file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`) when including figures, while others might omit it, relying on the LaTeX engine to automatically find the correct file.\n\n4. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command allows for optional arguments to be passed (like scale, width, height, etc.) before the file name. These need to be correctly parsed to extract only the file name.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: Sometimes, a line in LaTeX might include multiple figures, especially in subfigure environments or when using commands like `\\multirow` or `\\multicol`.\n\n6. **Comments**: Parts of a LaTeX document might be commented out with the `%` symbol. Figure commands within these commented sections should not be considered as they are not active parts of the document.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments**: LaTeX allows for defining custom commands and environments that might abstract away the figure inclusion commands, making it harder to detect without knowing these definitions.\n\n8. **Complex Environments**: Figures can also be included within more complex environments like `figure`, `minipage`, or `wrapfigure`, which may influence the way the figure file names should be extracted.\n\n9. **Corrupted or Malformatted Input**: The input file might have syntax errors or unconventional formatting that does not adhere to standard LaTeX practices, which could complicate parsing.\n\n10. **Encoding and Character Escaping**: Special characters in file names or paths may be escaped or encoded in certain ways within the LaTeX document.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, a robust solution should account for various use cases and possible deviations from standard practices to reliably extract all figure file names."
