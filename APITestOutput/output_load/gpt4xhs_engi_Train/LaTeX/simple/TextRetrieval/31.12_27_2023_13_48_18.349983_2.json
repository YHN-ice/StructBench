Parsing such customizations would require interpreting the definitions and expansion of such macros.\n\n8. **Conditional inclusions**: The document might use conditional compilation (with `\\if`, `\\else`, and `\\fi` commands) which might affect whether a figure is included or not.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, once I see the input file, I will attempt to extract the file names of all included figures, while handling these challenges to the best of my abilities.
