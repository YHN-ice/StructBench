Each has its own syntax and may require different parsing strategies.\n\n2. **Figure file paths**: The path to the figure files might be relative or absolute. Additionally, the paths might include directories that need to be parsed correctly.\n\n3. **File extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension of the figure, and sometimes they do not. A parser may need to handle both situations.\n\n4. **Comments**: Figures might be commented out using the `%` symbol, and these should typically be ignored when extracting figure file names.\n\n5. **Multiple figures in one line**: There might be lines where multiple figures are included within the same command, which requires careful parsing to separate the file names.\n\n6. **Different command options**: The `\\includegraphics` command, for example, can take various options that change the way the figure is displayed. These options could complicate the parsing process if they are not handled correctly.\n\n7. **Custom commands and environments**: A LaTeX document might define custom commands or environments that include figures, making it more difficult to extract them without understanding these custom definitions.\n\n8. **Encapsulating braces**: File names might be enclosed with braces `{}` which need to be parsed correctly to extract just the file name part.\n\nPaying attention to these potential obstacles will help in creating an accurate parser for extracting figure file names from a LaTeX document. Now you can present the input LaTeX file content for the parsing task."
