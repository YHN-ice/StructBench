Each of these commands may have different syntax and options.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: The path to the image file can be absolute or relative, and it can include various directory separators (e.g., forward or backward slashes). The file names can also have different extensions, or no extension at all if the LaTeX compiler is set to auto-determine the extension.\n\n3. **Options in Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command and others can include options in square brackets before the actual file path, which may affect the parsing process (e.g., `\\includegraphics[width=3cm]{image.png}`).\n\n4. **Commented Lines**: Sometimes image inclusion commands might be commented out in the LaTeX source code, so they should not be considered when extracting figure file names.\n\n5. **Custom Commands**: The document might define custom macros that wrap around the `\\includegraphics` command, making it harder to directly search for `\\includegraphics`.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Packages like `subfig` or `subcaption` can include multiple figures within a single environment, with multiple `\\includegraphics` commands.\n\n7. **Environments for Figures**: Figures could be included within figure environments (`figure` or `wrapfigure`, for example) or even in tables or other custom environments.\n\nGiven these challenges, parsing the LaTeX file accurately requires careful consideration of the syntax and context in which image files are included."
