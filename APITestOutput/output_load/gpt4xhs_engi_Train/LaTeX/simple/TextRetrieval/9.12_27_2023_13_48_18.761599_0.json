Also, users might define their own commands for bold text, which would not be recognized without custom handling.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments:** Some LaTeX commands allow for optional arguments preceding the main argument, which may appear in the bold text command and should be correctly parsed or ignored as needed.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in writing a robust parser or using an existing one to accurately extract the bold texts from a LaTeX file."
