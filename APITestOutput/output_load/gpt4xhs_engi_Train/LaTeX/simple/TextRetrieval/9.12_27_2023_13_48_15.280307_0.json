One needs to recognize all possible commands that can make text bold.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text in LaTeX may contain other formatting commands or environments nested inside it. Proper parsing must handle such cases without losing the bold text information.\n\n3. **Braces Matching**: LaTeX uses `{}` to define the scope of commands. The parser must correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the correct text within the `\\textbf{}` command.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: In LaTeX, the backslash `\\` is used to escape characters or introduce commands. The parser should distinguish between `\\textbf{}` as a command and `\\\\textbf{}` or `\\{textbf\\}` as possibly escaped sequences that do not denote bold text.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. Text within comments should not be considered part of the actual document content, and hence bold text within comments should be ignored.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: A LaTeX document might define custom commands for making text bold within the preamble. Understanding these custom commands would require parsing the preamble as well.\n\n7. **Multiple Bold Texts on the Same Line**: The parser might encounter multiple bold-text commands on the same line, which need to be identified and extracted separately.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties would be necessary for creating a robust LaTeX file parser that can accurately extract all bold texts."
