These options might precede the filename and could use square brackets `[]` or curly braces `{}`.\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Figure file paths can be relative to the directory containing the LaTeX document or absolute paths. We need to extract just the filenames, not their paths.\n4. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX commands specify the file extension (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`), while others omit it because LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type.\n5. **Commented Lines**: Lines starting with `%` are comments and should be ignored, as they do not contribute to the actual content being compiled.\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command may include multiple figures, especially within a figure environment where subfigures are used.\n7. **Custom Environments or Macros**: A LaTeX file might define custom commands or environments that obscure direct references to figure files, making extraction non-trivial.\n\nIf you provide the input file, I'll focus on the typical command `\\includegraphics` and any variations of it that are used for including figures, and I'll extract the filenames accordingly."
