Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Multiple Include Commands**: LaTeX offers different commands to include graphics (\\includegraphics, \\pgfimage, etc.), each with its own syntax. Figures could be included using different commands that may require different parsing strategies.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: The file paths for included figures can be absolute or relative and may include different directory separators (/, \\) depending on the operating system. File paths may also omit file extensions.\n\n3. **Optional Arguments**: The \\includegraphics command can have optional arguments for scaling, rotating, etc., which may complicate the extraction of the file name.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the % symbol. If a figure inclusion line is commented out, it should not be considered. But inline comments after the command should not prevent the extraction of the file name.\n\n5. **Custom Commands**: Users can define their own commands in LaTeX to include graphics which could encapsulate the standard include commands, thus hiding the actual file being included.\n\n6. **Figure Environments**: Figures are often included within a figure environment that might have additional content such as captions and labels, which needs to be ignored for the purpose of extracting figure file names.\n\n7. **Non-Standard Packages**: Some LaTeX documents may use non-standard packages for including figures, which could use completely different syntax for embedding images.\n\n8. **Multi-line Commands**: Sometimes commands are spread across multiple lines which makes it difficult to parse using simple line-by-line reading.\n\n9. **File Extensions Handling**: In LaTeX, it's not necessary to provide the file extension of the image being included, as LaTeX can automatically find the appropriate file. This may require additional logic to handle correctly.\n\n10. **Encodings and Character Escapes**: The LaTeX file may have a variety of encodings or use certain character escapes that need to be handled correctly to extract the file paths.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, a robust parsing strategy would need to handle a variety of cases and be flexible enough to account for different ways figures can be included in a LaTeX document."
