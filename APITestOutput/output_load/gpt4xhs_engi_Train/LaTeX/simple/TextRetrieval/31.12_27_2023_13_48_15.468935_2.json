Parsing a LaTeX file to extract included figure files can come up with several potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Multiple Commands**: The LaTeX command to include figures can vary (`\\includegraphics`, `\\epsfig`, etc.), and figures can be included inside different environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.). We'll need to account for the different ways figures can be included.\n\n2. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have several options before the actual file path (like `[width=0.5\\textwidth]`), so we need to correctly parse these options to extract the file path.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Figure file paths can be given as relative or absolute paths. Relative paths might be relative to the main LaTeX file or another specified directory, and absolute paths could point to a location outside of the document's structure.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension, and sometimes they don't. We might need to account for different file types (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, etc.) and the possibility of the extension being omitted.\n\n5. **Commented Lines**: The LaTeX file may contain comments that include the string `\\includegraphics`. These lines should be ignored when parsing the file.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: There might be commands that include multiple figures at once, so we need to handle these cases correctly.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Macros**: The LaTeX file could define custom commands or macros that include figures, which would require additional logic to resolve.\n\n8. **Environment Complexity**: Figures might be nested inside complex environments that require careful parsing to correctly extract figure names without getting text from unrelated parts of the document.\n\n9. **Figures Included in External Files**: Sometimes, figures are included in files that are subsequently included in the main LaTeX document through `\\input` or `\\include` commands, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help us in devising a proper parsing strategy and ensuring accurate extraction of figure file names from the LaTeX document."
