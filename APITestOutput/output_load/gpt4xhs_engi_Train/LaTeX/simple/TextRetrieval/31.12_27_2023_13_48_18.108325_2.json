It could also include variables or commands.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: In LaTeX, you can include a figure without specifying the file extension. The parser needs to handle cases where the extension is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, LaTeX commands can include multiple figures in one line, especially within figure environments or subfigure constructs.\n\n5. **Comments and Comments Blocks**: Figures included in comments should not be extracted. Comments in LaTeX start with `%` and continue to the end of the line. Blocks of comments might be wrapped with `\\iffalse ... \\fi`.\n\n6. **Complex File Names**: File names may contain spaces, special characters, or LaTeX commands that need to be interpreted or ignored accordingly.\n\n7. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command may have optional arguments that modify the behavior, like `[width=0.5\\textwidth]`, which are not part of the file name.\n\nTo accurately extract figure filenames from a LaTeX file, the parser needs to handle these complexities and correctly interpret the LaTeX syntax regarding figure inclusion."
