Command Variants: Even within `\\includegraphics`, there are many options and variations, like optional arguments for scaling and positioning that can be present before the actual file name.\n\n3. File Path Handling: Figures can be included with relative or absolute paths, and with or without the file extension. All these variations need to be correctly parsed to extract just the file name.\n\n4. Commented Lines: Parts of the LaTeX document including figure inclusion commands might be commented out using the `%` symbol. These should not be considered as they are not active content.\n\n5. Multiple Figures in One Command: There might be commands that include multiple figures at once (e.g., by passing a list of files to a custom command).\n\n6. Environment Handling: Figures might be included within different environments, like `figure`, `minipage`, etc., and the parser should be able to handle those correctly.\n\n7. Robustness to Errors: The LaTeX file might contain syntax errors or incomplete commands, and the parser should be robust enough to handle these gracefully, either by skipping them or reporting them as unprocessable.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the parser must be able to accurately navigate the LaTeX markup to identify and extract the correct file names for included figures."
