Recognizing all possible bold commands is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Curly Braces Matching**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to define the scope of commands. Extracting text may require proper parsing of these braces, even when they are nested.\n\n4. **Comments and Escaped Characters**: Text that appears to be bold might be commented out or include escaped characters, which would mean it shouldn't be treated as part of the output.\n\n5. **Custom Macros**: The document might define custom macros that change text to bold, which would not be recognized without parsing and understanding those macro definitions.\n\n6. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands**: If the LaTeX file has errors, such as incomplete or malformed bold commands, this could make it difficult to accurately extract the intended bold text.\n\n7. **Text Spread Across Lines**: The bold text might be spread across multiple lines or even pages, complicating the extraction process if a simple line-by-line approach is used.\n\nThese are some common issues that might arise when attempting to parse LaTeX files for specific text formats."
