The parser needs to handle both and extract the correct file name.\n\n4. **Comments and Comments Blocks**: The LaTeX file may contain comments (single line starting with `%`) or comment blocks that include graphics commands, which should be ignored by the parser.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in a Single Command**: A single command might include multiple figures, especially in commands like `\\subfloat` or `\\subfigure` within a figure environment.\n\n6. **Custom Commands**: The LaTeX document could define custom commands that internally include graphics. These would need to be recognized and parsed accordingly.\n\n7. **File Path Spaces and Special Characters**: If the file paths have spaces or special characters, they should be correctly parsed to extract the file names.\n\n8. **Graphics Included in Conditionals**: Sometimes graphics are included conditionally using LaTeX conditional statements; the parser must evaluate these correctly.\n\n9. **Figure Environments Without Graphics**: There might be figure environments that don't actually include a file (e.g., they contain only a caption or are placeholders).\n\n10. **Files Included from External Packages**: Some LaTeX packages might include files in ways that are not straightforward to parse without understanding the package's specific syntax.\n\nTo accurately extract all figure file names, the parser must intelligently navigate through these complexities."
