Identifying all the different commands that can include an image could be a challenge.\n\n2. **Different argument structures**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have options inside square brackets before the file name appears, which means that simply looking for a pattern might not be sufficient.\n\n3. **Relative and absolute paths**: Image file names can include paths that are either relative to the document or absolute paths on the file system. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n4. **File extensions**: Some LaTeX documents may include the file extension (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`), while others might omit it because LaTeX is capable of automatically determining the correct file type.\n\n5. **Comments**: If the LaTeX file has comments (`%`) that include lines resembling figure inclusions, these should be ignored.\n\n6. **Figure environments**: Figures might be included inside different environments like `figure`, `subfigure`, or even custom-defined environments. This adds complexity to the parsing.\n\n7. **Multiple figures in one command**: Some LaTeX packages allow including multiple figures within a single command, requiring more complex parsing logic.\n\n8. **Non-standard macros**: The document might define custom macros that include figures, and without knowing these macros, it can be tricky to find all figure file names.\n\n9. **Commands split over lines**: LaTeX is quite tolerant of line breaks, so a command that includes a graphic might be split over multiple lines.\n\n10. **Encapsulated filenames**: Filenames might be placed within curly braces or other LaTeX groups, which could affect a simple string search approach.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we would need a robust and well-designed parsing strategy that accounts for these complexities."
