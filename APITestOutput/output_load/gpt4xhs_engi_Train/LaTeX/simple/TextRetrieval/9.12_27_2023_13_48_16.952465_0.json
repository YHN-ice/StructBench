Identifying all the possible variations is necessary.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\n3. Command definitions: The document might have custom command definitions that change the default behavior of bold commands, which would require interpreting these definitions.\n\n4. Comments and inactive code: Parts of the LaTeX file that are commented out or otherwise not active should not be parsed as they are not part of the final document.\n\n5. Encoded characters or macros: Some bold texts might include LaTeX macros or encoded characters that need to be resolved to extract the raw text properly.\n\n6. Multi-line bold text: The text within bold commands might span multiple lines, requiring the parser to correctly handle line breaks and concatenate the text.\n\n7. False positives: There might be instances where the text looks like a command but is actually part of a package option or included in verbatim environments, and these should not be parsed as commands.\n\nGiven these potential issues, a parser would need to be quite sophisticated to reliably extract all bold texts from a LaTeX file.
