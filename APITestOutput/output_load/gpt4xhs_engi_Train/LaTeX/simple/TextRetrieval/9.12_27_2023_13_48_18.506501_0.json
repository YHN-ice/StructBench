These should not be mistakenly identified as bold text.\n\n5. **Comments and inactive code**: Comments (starting with `%`) and possibly inactive code blocks should be ignored, as they are not part of the output document.\n\n6. **Complex structures**: The bold text might be inside more complex structures like tables, custom commands, or even commented out, which could make extraction difficult.\n\n7. **Cross-referencing**: If there are macros or commands that define bold text outside of their usage (for example, in the preamble), the parser would need to account for this when extracting text.\n\n8. **Incomplete or malformed LaTeX**: If the LaTeX code is incomplete (e.g., missing closing braces) or malformed, it may be difficult to correctly parse and extract the intended text.\n\nEach of these challenges would need to be handled carefully in order to accurately extract all instances of bold text from a LaTeX file."
