The parser should be prepared to handle and recognize different extensions.\n\n2. **Path specifications**: Figures might be included with relative or absolute paths, and these paths may contain directory separators that vary between operating systems.\n\n3. **Graphic inclusion commands**: There could be variations in how graphics are included, such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, or custom-defined commands in the LaTeX preamble.\n\n4. **Comments**: Figure inclusion lines may be commented out using the `%` character. The parser needs to ignore such lines.\n\n5. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command may include optional arguments before the file name, which must be handled correctly to extract the file name.\n\n6. **File names with spaces or special characters**: If file names contain spaces or special characters, they may be enclosed in braces `{}` which the parser needs to account for.\n\n7. **Continuation lines**: File paths that are too long to fit on one line might be broken up into multiple lines using the LaTeX continuation character `%`.\n\n8. **Graphics included within environments or macros**: Figures might be wrapped within LaTeX environments (e.g., `figure`, `minipage`) or user-defined macros, which could complicate extraction.\n\nTo successfully extract all figure file names, the parser must be able to handle these potential issues accurately."
