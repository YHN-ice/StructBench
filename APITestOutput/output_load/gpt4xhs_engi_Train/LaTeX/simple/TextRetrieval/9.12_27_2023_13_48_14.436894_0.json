Correctly identifying the matching pairs of braces is essential, especially when dealing with nested commands.\n\n4. **Comments**: The LaTeX file may contain comments (`%` symbol), which could include bold commands that are not meant to be rendered and should be ignored.\n\n5. **Incomplete Commands**: The document might have syntax errors or incomplete commands which could lead to incorrect extractions.\n\n6. **Custom Commands**: The document may define custom commands for bold text using `\\newcommand`, which would need to be identified and interpreted correctly.\n\n7. **Environment Conflicts**: Bold commands within certain environments may not behave as expected, or the environment itself may change how text appears (e.g., within a `\\verbatim` environment).\n\n8. **Inline Math Mode**: Bold text inside inline math mode (denoted by `$`) might not be processed as regular text and can have different commands (e.g., `\\mathbf{}`).\n\nGiven these potential issues, parsing the file will require careful consideration of the LaTeX syntax and possibly some heuristics if the parsing aims to handle all possible edge cases."
