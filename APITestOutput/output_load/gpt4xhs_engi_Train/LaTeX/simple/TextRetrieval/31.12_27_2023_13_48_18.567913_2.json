This is because LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type if multiple versions exist (e.g., `.png`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`).\n\n4. **Comments**: The LaTeX file could contain commented-out sections that include figure filenames which should not be counted as included figures.\n\n5. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can include options in square brackets before the filename, which could include additional brackets or commas that need to be properly parsed.\n\n6. **Figure Environments**: Figures can be included within different environments, such as `figure`, `subfigure`, `minipage`, etc., and the parser must accurately detect the relevant commands within these environments.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures (e.g., subfigures), and the parser needs to detect each filename individually.\n\n8. **Custom Commands**: There might be user-defined macros or commands in the document that abstract away the figure inclusion process, thus complicating direct pattern matching.\n\n9. **Bracket Balancing**: It's necessary to correctly balance curly and square brackets to avoid incorrectly parsing partial filenames or additional arguments as part of the filename.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: If the file is not in a standard text encoding or contains special characters, it could cause issues with reading and parsing the file's contents.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, a robust LaTeX figure extraction would need to account for these complexities to accurately retrieve all included figure filenames."
