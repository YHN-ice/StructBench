For example, `\\textbf{\\emph{Some text}}` combines bold and italic formatting.\n\n3. **Grouping and scopes**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` for grouping and scope. Bold text might be scoped within braces that also contain other content, making it challenging to extract only the bold portions.\n\n4. **Comments and ignored content**: Comments in LaTeX (starting with `%`) should be ignored by the parser, as they are not rendered in the final document.\n\n5. **Custom environments and classes**: Some LaTeX documents may use custom styles or classes that define their own environments for bold text, which may not be immediately recognizable without an understanding of the custom style.\n\n6. **Inline vs. display elements**: Bold text could appear within both inline and block (display) elements. The parser must be able to handle both cases.\n\n7. **Special characters and LaTeX commands**: Special characters and commands within the bold text might affect how the text should be extracted (e.g., handling of `\\&`, `\\_`, etc.).\n\n8. **Conditional statements**: Some LaTeX documents contain conditional statements that may affect whether or not some text is actually rendered in bold.\n\nHandling these challenges requires a robust parsing strategy that can correctly identify and extract text that is meant to appear in bold in the resulting document, taking into account the nuances of LaTeX syntax and semantics."
