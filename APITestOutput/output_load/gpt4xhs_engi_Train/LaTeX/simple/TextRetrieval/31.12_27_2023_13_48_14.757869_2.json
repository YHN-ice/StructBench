Different commands for including graphics: LaTeX has multiple commands that can be used to include graphics, such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\include`, `\\input`, etc. We need to know which commands are used for including figures.\n\n2. Variations in command usage: Even within a single command like `\\includegraphics`, users might employ optional arguments for formatting, which can alter the appearance of the command. For example, `\\includegraphics[width=3cm]{file}` and `\\includegraphics{file}` are both valid but look different.\n\n3. File paths: The included figure files can have relative or absolute paths, and they may or may not include the file extension. Handling these variations is necessary to extract a clean list of filenames.\n\n4. Comments: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. An include command within a comment should not be considered.\n\n5. Multiple figures in one command: Sometimes, figures might be included within a loop or a macro that generates multiple include commands at once.\n\n6. Nested files: If the LaTeX document uses `\\input` or `\\include` to include other LaTeX files, the figures might be included in those files, and not directly in the main file.\n\n7. Encapsulation in environments: Figures might be included within different environments, such as `figure`, `minipage`, etc., which may require additional parsing logic to extract correctly.\n\n8. Multiple figures in one line: There could be multiple figures included on a single line, separated by commas or other delimiters.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, one would need to:\n\n- Identify all commands used for including graphics.\n- Parse optional arguments without considering them part of the filename.\n- Normalize file paths and extensions.\n- Ignore comments and commands within them.\n- Handle special cases such as loops, macros, nested files, and encapsulating environments.\n- Split lines with multiple figures appropriately."
