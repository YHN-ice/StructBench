Distinguishing between these uses can be tricky.\n\n7. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands:** The LaTeX file might have incomplete or malformed bold text commands due to human error or file corruption.\n\n8. **Environment Conflicts:** Bold text inside certain LaTeX environments might behave differently or require different commands, which can complicate extraction.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust LaTeX parser needs to account for the syntax and semantics of LaTeX, handle various edge cases, and understand the document structure."
