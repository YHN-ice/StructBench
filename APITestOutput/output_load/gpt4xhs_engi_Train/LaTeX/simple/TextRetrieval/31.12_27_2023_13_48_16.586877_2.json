We need to anticipate and handle all possible commands used for including figures.\n\n2. **File path variations**: The file paths for figures could be provided with or without file extensions, with relative or absolute paths, or nested within directories. We must parse these variations correctly to extract the file names.\n\n3. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command may have optional arguments that could contain additional, non-file-related options. Parsing must reliably differentiate between optional arguments and the actual file path.\n\n4. **Comments and line breaks**: LaTeX comments (anything after `%`) should be ignored in the parsing process, as they are not part of the actual document content. Additionally, line breaks and continuation characters might be used within the figure inclusion commands.\n\n5. **Environment encapsulation**: Figures may be included within different environments like `figure`, `minipage`, or custom environments. This should not affect the extraction of the figure file names.\n\n6. **File name extraction accuracy**: The parser must accurately extract the full file name, including directory paths if present, while excluding the LaTeX command syntax and braces.\n\n7. **Command redefinition**: If any LaTeX commands are redefined in the document preamble or elsewhere, this may affect how figures are included and thus how they should be parsed.\n\nTo handle these challenges, robust regex patterns or dedicated LaTeX parsing libraries might be necessary to accurately extract figure file names from the document."
