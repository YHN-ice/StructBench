Parsing these commands to extract the raw text may require understanding of the LaTeX commands' syntax and semantics.\n\n4. **Environment blocks**: Content within `\\begin{}` and `\\end{}` blocks may need special handling, especially if the blocks are nested or if they contain other sections or subsections.\n\n5. **Multiple files**: LaTeX documents can be split across multiple files using `\\input{}` or `\\include{}` commands. If the content of the subsection is in an external file, it would be necessary to parse that file as well.\n\n6. **Custom commands and macros**: The document might define custom commands or macros which influence how sections and subsections are formatted or numbered. Understanding these customizations could be important for correct parsing.\n\n7. **Conditional compilation**: Parts of the document might be conditionally included or excluded using commands like `\\if`, `\\ifdef`, etc., which could affect which sections are actually present in the compiled document.\n\n8. **Starred vs. non-starred versions**: Sections and subsections can have starred versions (e.g., `\\section*{}`) that do not show up in the table of contents and do not get numbered.
