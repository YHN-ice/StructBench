If such commands are used within a section, it may be unclear whether to include the content from those files or not.\n\n8. **Cross Referencing**: Cross-references (`\\label`, `\\ref`, `\\cite`) will appear as commands rather than the final output numbers or titles, which might be confusing in the context of the content.\n\nThese are some of the issues that could complicate extracting a section's content verbatim from a LaTeX file.
