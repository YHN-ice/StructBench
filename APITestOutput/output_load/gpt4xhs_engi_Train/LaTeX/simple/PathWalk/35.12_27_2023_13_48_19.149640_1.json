Additionally, conditional text (using `\\if... \\fi` constructs) might complicate parsing as it may or may not be included based on the conditions.\n\n4. **Inclusion of external files**: LaTeX allows for modularity with commands like `\\input` or `\\include` that insert content from external files. If the subsection's content is in an external file, one would need access to that file to parse the content.\n\n5. **Cross-referencing labels**: Understanding cross-references within the document (using `\\label`, `\\ref`, or `\\autoref` commands) might require additional context which might not be present in the excerpt.\n\n6. **Complex formatting**: LaTeX allows for advanced formatting that could affect how the content is represented in plain text.
