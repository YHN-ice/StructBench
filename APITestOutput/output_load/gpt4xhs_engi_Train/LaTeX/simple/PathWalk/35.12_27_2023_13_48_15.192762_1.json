Identifying the correct section and subsection might require parsing and understanding this syntax.\n\n2. **Comments and Conditional Text:** LaTeX allows for comments in the text that are not displayed in the final document. Additionally, there can be conditional text that is included or excluded based on certain conditions. These factors might complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Custom Commands and Environments:** The file might define custom commands or environments that change the way sections and subsections are defined. Without understanding these customizations, it may be difficult to identify the correct content.\n\n4. **Nested Environments:** LaTeX allows for nested environments, such as a subsection within a section or even nested subsections. Properly navigating this structure is essential to locate the correct content.\n\n5. **Multiple Files:** Sometimes, a LaTeX document is split across multiple files using the `\\input` or `\\include` commands. If the relevant subsection is in another file, it would be necessary to locate and parse that file as well.\n\n6. **Cross-referencing:** Sections and subsections might be labeled for cross-referencing, which could add complexity to the structure and make it harder to simply extract content based on headings alone.\n\nOnce we have the actual LaTeX file, we can determine which of these potential difficulties apply and how to overcome them to provide you with the requested excerpt."
