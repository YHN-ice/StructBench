Depending on the conditions, different content may be included in the final document.\n\n5. **Cross-Referencing**: Labels and references are common in LaTeX documents. Without proper processing, references might appear as question marks or raw commands.\n\n6. **Inclusion of External Files**: LaTeX documents can include external files using commands like `\\input` or `\\include`. Without access to these files, it could be impossible to parse content from them.\n\n7. **Handling of Packages**: The behavior of many LaTeX commands can be altered by the packages imported in the preamble. Without interpreting the preamble, it might be hard to understand how certain commands should be rendered.\n\n8. **In-line vs. Block Elements**: Distinguishing between in-line elements (like `\\textit{}`) and block elements (like `quote` or `verbatim`) is essential to extract content accurately.\n\nAddressing these challenges would require a sophisticated parser that can simulate the behavior of a LaTeX compiler to some degree.
