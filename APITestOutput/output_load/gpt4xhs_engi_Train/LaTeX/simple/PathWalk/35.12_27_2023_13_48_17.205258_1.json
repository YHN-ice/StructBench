The parser must recognize these custom commands and interpret them correctly.\n\n3. **Incomplete or Malformed Structure**: If the LaTeX file is not structured correctly (e.g., missing section numbers, missing end statements for environments), it may be difficult to accurately identify sections and subsections.\n\n4. **Comments and Extraneous Text**: Comments in LaTeX start with `%` and are not printed in the final document. These should be ignored by the parser. Additionally, there might be text that is not part of the actual content, such as LaTeX commands for formatting, which should not be included in the extracted excerpt.\n\n5. **Referencing and Labels**: LaTeX often includes cross-referencing commands like `\\label` and `\\ref`. Understanding how these relate to sections and whether they should be included in the output can be tricky.\n\n6. **Environments and Packages**: The file might use various environments (like `figure`, `table`, `equation`) and packages that alter the default behavior of sections and subsections. The parser must understand how these affect the document structure.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, an accurate parser must recognize LaTeX commands, ignore comments and non-content text, process custom styling, and maintain a correct representation of the document hierarchy.
