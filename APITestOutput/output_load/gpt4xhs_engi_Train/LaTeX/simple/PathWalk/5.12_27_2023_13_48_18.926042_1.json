Recognizing the start and end of these environments is essential.\n\n3. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the % symbol, which means that anything following % on a line is not part of the document's content. I'll need to ignore comments when parsing for content.\n\n4. **Conditional compilation**: LaTeX supports conditional compilation with commands like \\if, \\else, \\fi. This could potentially hide or reveal different content based on conditions, making parsing more complex.\n\n5. **Custom commands**: LaTeX users can define their own commands, which might change how content is structured or presented. Without knowing the definitions of these commands, understanding the document's structure could be challenging.\n\n6. **Cross-referencing**: LaTeX documents often contain labels and references, which don't make sense out of context. While extracting content, I'll need to decide how to handle these references.\n\n7. **Encoding and characters**: Special characters and encoding might not be standard text, so they'll require proper handling to ensure they are represented correctly in the output.\n\n8. **Multiple files**: A LaTeX document can be split into multiple files using \\input or \\include commands. Understanding the overall structure may require combining information from multiple files.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, I would need to carefully parse the LaTeX file to extract the first section's content accurately.
