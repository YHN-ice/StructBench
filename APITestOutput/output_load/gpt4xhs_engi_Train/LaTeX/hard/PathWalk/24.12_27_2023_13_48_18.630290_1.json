Custom Commands: LaTeX allows the definition of custom commands, which might alter the appearance or behavior of sectioning commands, making it harder to identify the correct level of hierarchy.\n\n3. Nested Environments: Content within sections could be nested inside various environments (e.g., `itemize`, `enumerate`, `figure`), which might complicate text extraction.\n\n4. Comments: Content could be commented out, so it's essential to differentiate between active text and comments.\n\n5. Cross-referencing and Labels: Sections may have labels for cross-referencing, which do not appear in the final output but are part of the LaTeX source.\n\n6. Conditional Compilation: The use of conditional compilation commands (e.g., `\\if`, `\\ifdef`, `\\ifndef`) could conditionally include or exclude parts of the document, affecting the content we see.\n\nTo extract the content accurately, the parser must handle these potential issues effectively."
