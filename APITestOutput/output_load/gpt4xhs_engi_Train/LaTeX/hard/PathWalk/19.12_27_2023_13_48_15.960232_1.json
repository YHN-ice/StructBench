The parser might need to resolve these to access all content.\n\n8. **Conditional compilation**: Some sections might be included or excluded based on certain conditions using commands like `\\if`, `\\ifdef`, etc.\n\n9. **Non-standard sectioning**: Some documents might use non-standard ways to create sections, such as custom macros, which might not be easily recognizable as section delimiters.\n\nThese are some of the challenges you might encounter when parsing a LaTeX file to extract specific content.
