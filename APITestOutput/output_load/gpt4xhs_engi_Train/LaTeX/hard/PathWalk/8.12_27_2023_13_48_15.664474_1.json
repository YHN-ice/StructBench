However, they may contain information that affects the interpretation of the document structure.\n\n6. **User-defined macros**: Authors can define their own macros in LaTeX, which can encapsulate complex behavior and obscure the document's logical structure unless these macros are expanded.\n\n7. **Environment nesting**: Subsections may be nested within other environments (like figures, tables, or custom blocks) which could complicate the extraction.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will be pivotal in accurately parsing the LaTeX file and extracting the desired content.
