Additionally, there might be conditional text included with `\\if` commands that may or may not be included in the output depending on certain conditions.\n\n3. **Nested Environments:** LaTeX allows for the nesting of environments within each other, such as `itemize` within a `subsection`. Identifying where a subsection ends in nested environments can be tricky.\n\n4. **Custom Commands and Environments:** Users can define their own commands and environments in LaTeX, which might change how sections and subsections are denoted and formatted.\n\n5. **Inclusion of External Files:** LaTeX allows for modularity with commands like `\\input` and `\\include` that insert content from external files. If subsections are in external files, accessing their content would require parsing those files as well.\n\n6. **Formatting Commands:** Text formatting commands intermixed with content (such as `\\textbf`, `\\emph`, etc.) might make it harder to cleanly extract just the textual content of a section without losing some context provided by formatting.\n\n7. **Labels and Cross-Referencing:** Commands like `\\label` and `\\ref` are often used in LaTeX for cross-referencing. A subsection might be referred to elsewhere in the document, but these commands do not contain content themselves.\n\nTo provide an accurate excerpt of a specific subsection, all these potential obstacles must be carefully managed while parsing the LaTeX source code."
