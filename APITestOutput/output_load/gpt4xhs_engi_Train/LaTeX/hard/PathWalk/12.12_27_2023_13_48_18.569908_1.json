This would require evaluating these conditions to determine the actual content.\n\n6. **Multiple Files**: A LaTeX project can be split across multiple files using `\\input` or `\\include` commands. If the referenced subsection content is in another file, it may need to be located and parsed separately.\n\n7. **Heading Levels**: Ensuring you are looking at the correct level of headings (sections, subsections, subsubsections) is crucial to answering correctly, especially since numbering can reset with each higher level (e.g., the counter for subsections resets for each new section).\n\n8. **Text Formatting**: Text formatting commands (like `\\textbf`, `\\emph`, etc.) might be present within the text and need to be interpreted or stripped based on the requirement of the output format.\n\nTo accurately extract the required content, one would need to systematically navigate the LaTeX file structure, handle the above-mentioned complexities, and ignore irrelevant content such as preamble settings or unrelated sections."
