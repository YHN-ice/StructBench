These need to be distinguished from the actual content.\n\n4. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX start with `%` and should not be considered part of the content. Ensuring that comments are ignored is essential.\n\n5. **Command Parameters**: Commands in LaTeX might have parameters that could be mistaken for content. For example, `\\section{Title}` - \"Title\" is the content, but `\\section` is not.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The file may contain custom-defined commands and environments that alter the expected structure or content.
