Keeping track of the levels and extracting the correct part requires careful navigation through the document structure.\n\n2. **Custom commands and environments:** LaTeX allows the definition of custom commands and environments, which might alter the appearance or structure of sections and subsections. A parser has to interpret these correctly or recognize they are not relevant for extracting plain text content.\n\n3. **Comments and conditionals:** Content within comments (lines starting with `%`) should be ignored, as it is not part of the compiled document. Additionally, conditional structures (e.g., `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`) may affect which parts of the document are actually used.\n\n4. **In-line commands and formatting:** The actual content may include in-line commands for formatting (such as `\\textbf`, `\\emph`, etc.), which could affect how the extracted text should be presented.\n\n5. **Cross-referencing and labels:** The document may contain labels, citations, or references that only make sense within the context of the entire document. These need to be handled appropriately when extracting a snippet.\n\n6. **External files:** Sometimes, LaTeX documents can dynamically include content from other files using commands like `\\input` or `\\include`. Such external dependencies could make it hard to extract content if those files are not accessible.\n\nTo correctly parse and extract the requested content, the parser must be able to handle these complexities and still identify the desired text based on the provided structure (2nd subsubsection under 1st subsection under 2nd section)."
