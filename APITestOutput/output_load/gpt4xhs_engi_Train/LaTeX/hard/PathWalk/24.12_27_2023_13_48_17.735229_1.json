Here are potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Nested Environments**: LaTeX allows for different environments, such as `section`, `subsection`, `subsubsection`, etc., which can be nested within each other. Keeping track of the hierarchy to identify the correct location of the 1st subsubsection under the 1st subsection under the 2nd section might be challenging.\n\n2. **Counting Sections**: LaTeX does not use 0-based indexing, so the 2nd section would be labeled with `\\section`, and it would be the second occurrence in the document. The same applies to subsections and subsubsections, so careful tracking is required.\n\n3. **LaTeX Commands and Formatting**: The text's appearance may be affected by various commands, and these should be ignored or interpreted correctly when extracting the plain content.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol; any text after this on a line is ignored by LaTeX. This must be taken into account to avoid extracting commented-out sections.\n\n5. **Custom Commands and Macros**: If the LaTeX file defines custom commands or uses macros, understanding their impact on the document structure may be necessary.\n\n6. **External References**: If the document refers to external files (with `\\input` or `\\include` commands), content from those files may need to be considered.\n\n7. **Conditional Compilation**: LaTeX can conditionally include or exclude content (with `\\if`...`\\fi` constructs), which could affect whether a section exists in the final output.\n\nWith these potential issues in mind, I am ready to look at the input file to provide the requested excerpt from the LaTeX content. Please provide the file or its content so that I can proceed with parsing and extracting the relevant information."
