Without knowledge of these custom definitions, some bold texts might be missed.\n\n4. **Comments and inactive code**: If the bold text is within a comment line (starting with `%`) or part of code that is not active due to being commented out or within a conditional statement that does not execute, it should not be considered.\n\n5. **External files**: Bold text might be included from external files using input or include commands. Such cases would require parsing those files as well.\n\n6. **Complex layouts**: Bold text could be part of more complex layouts, such as in tables or figures, where the parsing logic needs to account for these structures.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, let's proceed to see the input LaTeX file to identify and extract the bold texts."
