Each command might have different syntax or options that could affect the way the filename is specified.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: Included files might be located in different directories, and the path could be relative or absolute. The parser must handle various path formats correctly.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: LaTeX does not require the user to specify the file extension when including a graphic file. The parser has to consider this and possibly look for the most common graphic file extensions.\n\n4. **Commented Lines**: It's common practice in LaTeX to comment out lines of code with `%`. The parser must ignore these lines as they're not active content.\n\n5. **Complex Commands**: Filenames might be generated by commands or macros within LaTeX, which could make it difficult to extract the actual filename without executing those commands.\n\n6. **File Names with Spaces or Special Characters**: If filenames include spaces or special characters, they might be enclosed in braces `{}` or quotes `\"\"`, and the parser needs to account for these cases to extract the full filename.\n\n7. **Options in Include Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command can include options like scaling or rotation before the file name, so the parser should be able to distinguish between options and the actual file path.\n\n8. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: In some cases, a single command might include multiple files, such as with subfigures or custom commands defined by the user.\n\n9. **Conditional Inclusion**: Some documents use conditional statements (e.g., `\\if... \\fi`) to determine which images to include; the parser has to evaluate these conditions to determine the actual files being included.\n\n10. **External Files Inclusion**: The document might include figures from external files using `\\input` or similar commands, so the parser might need to also parse those external files to extract all figures.\n\nBy considering these challenges in advance, we can develop a more robust parsing strategy that takes into account various LaTeX practices and document structures."
