Multiple Commands for Bold: In LaTeX, bold text can be created using different commands, such as `\\textbf{}`, `\\bf{}`, or even custom commands defined in the preamble. This requires the parser to recognize all such commands that result in bold text.\n\n2. Nested Commands: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, such as italics, underlines, or custom environments. Properly parsing these nested structures can be challenging.\n\n3. Command Parameters: The LaTeX commands may have optional parameters that should not be confused with the intended bold text.\n\n4. Brackets and Braces: Ensuring that the parser correctly identifies matching braces `{}` that enclose the bold text, especially if there are nested braces.\n\n5. Comments and Inactive Text: Text that appears within comments (after `%` sign) or inactive blocks should not be considered as part of the output.\n\n6. Custom Macros: If the LaTeX file defines custom macros that result in bold text, the parser would need to understand and properly expand these macros to extract the text.\n\n7. Incomplete or Malformed Tags: If the LaTeX file contains errors, such as incomplete tags or mismatched braces, it could lead to incorrect parsing results.\n\n8. Encodings and Character Sets: Handling of different character encodings and special characters within bold text must be accurate to ensure correct extraction.\n\nNow, please provide the LaTeX file input so that I can attempt to extract the bold texts as requested."
