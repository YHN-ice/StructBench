It's crucial to recognize all the different ways figures may be included.\n\n2. **Different syntax for paths**: The file path in the include command can be wrapped in curly braces `{}` or in square brackets `[]` for optional arguments, and the actual file path might be enclosed in double quotes `\"\"`, single quotes `''`, or no quotes at all.\n\n3. **Relative and absolute paths**: Figures might be included using relative paths that depend on the file structure of the project or using absolute paths that are machine-specific.\n\n4. **File extensions**: LaTeX allows the inclusion of graphics without specifying the file extension, relying instead on the engine to locate the correct file. This means that a parser must potentially look for multiple file types unless the extension is explicitly mentioned.\n\n5. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX document, including figure inclusion commands, could be commented out with `%`.
