Some LaTeX compilers are capable of handling images without specifying the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command. The parser needs to account for this.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Figures might be included using either relative or absolute paths. The parser needs to extract the correct file path irrespective of how it's specified.\n\n4. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have optional arguments that specify attributes like scale, width, height, angle, etc. The parser needs to ignore these options to correctly extract the filename.\n\n5. **Commented Out Lines**: Files that are commented out should not be included in the output since they are not part of the compiled document.\n\n6. **File Path with Spaces**: Sometimes file paths might include spaces, which can be enclosed in `{}` within the LaTeX command, complicating the extraction process.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: There could be lines where multiple figures are included within a single command or line, and the parser should be able to handle this.\n\n8. **Custom Commands**: Some LaTeX documents define custom commands that encapsulate `\\includegraphics` or other include commands, making it trickier to identify which files are included.\n\n9. **Graphicspath Command**: The `\\graphicspath` command allows users to set paths for graphics to be searched within. The parser must combine this with the file name if necessary to produce the correct full path.\n\n10. **Subfigures or Subfiles**: If the document uses packages or environments like `subfigure` or `subfiles`, the structure might be nested and more complex to parse.\n\nTaking these potential issues into account will be crucial for accurately extracting all included figure files from the LaTeX source code provided."
