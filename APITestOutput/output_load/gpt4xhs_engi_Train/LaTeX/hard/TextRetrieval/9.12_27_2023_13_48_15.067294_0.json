Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise while attempting to extract bold texts from a LaTeX file:\n\n1. Different Commands for Bold Text: LaTeX provides multiple commands for making text bold, such as `\\textbf{...}`, `\\bf{...}`, or even custom commands defined by the user in the preamble or macros. Identifying all possible commands used for bold text can be a challenge.\n\n2. Nested Commands: Bold text commands might be nested inside other commands or environments. For instance, `\\textbf{\\textit{Bold and Italic}}` has bold text within an italic command. Properly parsing nested commands requires careful consideration.\n\n3. Command Arguments Spanning Lines: The argument for the bold command might span multiple lines, which makes text extraction trickier, as line breaks need to be properly handled.\n\n4. Comments and Conditional Text: Text within comments (denoted by `%`) should not be extracted as it is not rendered in the final document. Additionally, text within conditionals might only sometimes be rendered as bold depending on the condition.\n\n5. Custom Macros: A document might define custom macros that change the behavior of standard commands or introduce new ways to bold text that are not immediately recognizable without executing those macros.\n\n6. Encoded Characters: LaTeX files may contain special characters or encoded representations (like `\\'e` for é), which should be correctly interpreted when extracting text.\n\n7. Incomplete or Malformed Commands: If the LaTeX file contains syntax errors or incomplete commands, parsing might be problematic.\n\nTo properly parse a LaTeX file and extract bold texts, a parser needs to be able to handle these scenarios appropriately. Let's proceed with seeing the input file so that we can attempt to extract the bold texts according to its contents."
