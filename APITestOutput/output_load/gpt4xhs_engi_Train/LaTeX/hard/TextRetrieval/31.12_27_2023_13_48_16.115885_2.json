The parser must handle these variations.\n\n3. **Different File Extensions:** Figures can be in different formats such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, etc. The parser should not assume any specific file extension.\n\n4. **Optional Arguments:** The `\\includegraphics` command might have optional arguments before the actual file name, e.g., `\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{file.png}`. The parser has to correctly ignore these options to extract the file name.\n\n5. **Comments and Non-Standard Usage:** Figures might be commented out with `%` or included within non-standard environments. The parser needs to differentiate between active code and commented-out code.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command:** Sometimes, LaTeX users include multiple figures within a single figure environment; the parser must extract all included file names.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Macros:** The document might define custom commands or macros which include figures. The parser would need to understand these macros to extract the figure names.\n\n8. **Files Included in Other Files:** If the LaTeX document includes other files with `\\input` or `\\include`, and those files contain figures, the parser might need to parse those files as well.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the actual extraction process could require sophisticated parsing to accurately identify all figures included in the LaTeX file."
