For example, `\\textbf{\\emph{Bold and italic}}`. Correctly parsing nested commands requires understanding LaTeX's scoping rules.\n\n3. **Inline vs. Block**: Bold text might appear inline within a paragraph or as part of a larger block element, like a section heading. The parser needs to handle both cases appropriately.\n\n4. **Custom Macros**: Users can define their own macros which might encapsulate bold text. For example:\n   ```\n   \\newcommand{\\mybold}[1]{\\textbf{#1}}\n   \\mybold{This is bold}\n   ```\n   Identifying such custom macros would require parsing \\newcommand definitions.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX comments, starting with `%`, might contain bold commands that shouldn't be executed. Correct parsing requires ignoring commented-out text.\n\n6. **Special Characters**: Special characters in LaTeX, such as `{`, `}`, `&`, `%`, etc., might be part of the bold text and need to be handled correctly.\n\n7. **Environment Handling**: Bold text commands within certain environments could behave differently, such as within `tabular` or `equation` environments.\n\nEach of these challenges requires careful consideration in the design of the LaTeX file parser to ensure accurate extraction of bold text segments from the document."
