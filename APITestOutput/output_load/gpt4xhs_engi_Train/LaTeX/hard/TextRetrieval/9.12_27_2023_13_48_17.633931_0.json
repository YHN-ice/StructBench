Handling all possible variations will be necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands:** Bold commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Custom Commands and Environments:** Users can define their custom commands or environments that may change text to bold. Recognizing these without predefined knowledge would be difficult.\n\n4. **Comments and Escaped Characters:** Comments (`%`) and escaped characters (e.g., `\\%`) may also contain the commands for bold text, but these should not be interpreted as formatting instructions.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Broken Commands:** A LaTeX document might contain incomplete or broken commands that would not render properly in an actual LaTeX processor, but these cases still need to be handled by the parser.\n\n6. **Multi-Line and Inline Texts:** Bold text may span across multiple lines or be inline within a paragraph, requiring the parser to handle both scenarios effectively.\n\n7. **Brace Matching:** Since LaTeX uses braces `{}` to enclose the parameters of commands, correctly matching opening and closing braces is crucial, especially for nested commands.\n\n8. **LaTeX Packages:** Some LaTeX packages may introduce alternative ways to make text bold which are not standard and would require specific knowledge about those packages to parse correctly.\n\n9. **Starred Versions of Commands:** Some LaTeX commands have starred versions (e.g., `\\textbf*{}`) which might have different behaviors that should also be accounted for in the parsing process.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser will need to be robust enough to handle a variety of cases and LaTeX nuances to accurately extract all bold texts from the file."
