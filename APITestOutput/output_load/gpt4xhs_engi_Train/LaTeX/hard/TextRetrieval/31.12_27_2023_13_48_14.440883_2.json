We have to account for all possible commands that can be used to include figures.\n\n2. **Path complexity**: Figures can be included with relative or absolute paths, and these paths may contain directories.

We need to consider this possibility.\n\n4. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command and similar commands often have optional arguments that can include additional brackets before the actual file name. These arguments can include scaling options, rotation, etc., and we have to parse past them to get the file name.\n\n5. **Comments and whitespace**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol, which could be present before, after, or within figure inclusion commands. Similarly, there could be whitespace that needs to be navigated.\n\n6. **Multiple figure files in one command**: Some LaTeX packages allow including multiple files within a single command (such as subfigures within a figure environment), so we should handle this case properly.\n\n7. **Environments and grouping**: Figures might be included within different environments like `figure`, `minipage`, or others, and they might be grouped with `{...}` which could affect how we parse the document.\n\nGiven these possible issues, we'll need to create a robust parsing strategy to correctly identify and extract the names of the figure files included in the LaTeX input provided."
