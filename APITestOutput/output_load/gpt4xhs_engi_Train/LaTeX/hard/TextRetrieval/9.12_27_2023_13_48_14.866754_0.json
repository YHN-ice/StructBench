The parser must recognize all these possibilities.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text may be nested within other text styling commands or environments, so the parser needs to handle nested cases properly without missing any bold text.\n\n3. **Custom commands**: A LaTeX document may define custom commands that result in bold text. The parser would need to know these custom commands to recognize the bold text correctly.\n\n4. **Comments**: Bold text within comments (`% ...`) should not be treated as part of the main document, so the parser should ignore such instances.\n\n5. **Environment-specific behavior**: Text within certain environments might have different styling rules, and the parser needs to account for this.\n\n6. **Conditionals and macros**: LaTeX allows for conditional statements and macros that could potentially change how text is rendered. The parser must evaluate these correctly to determine if the text is indeed bold.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it's important for the parser to accurately navigate the LaTeX syntax and structure to extract the correct bold texts. Now let's proceed with parsing the input file you'll provide. Please include a sample LaTeX snippet that includes bold text, and I'll attempt to parse it accordingly."
