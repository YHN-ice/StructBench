When parsing a LaTeX file to extract all included figure file names, several potential difficulties and obstacles may arise:\n\n1. **Various Include Commands**: LaTeX supports different commands to include graphics (e.g., `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, `\\include`), each with its own syntax. We must recognize all possible commands that can include figures.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: The path to included figures can be absolute or relative, and can involve complex directory structures. We need to correctly parse and extract the file name regardless of the path complexity.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension when specifying the image file, but often they do not. The parser must handle both scenarios.\n\n4. **Options in Include Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options specified in square brackets before the file name (e.g., `\\includegraphics[width=3cm]{image}`). The parser must ignore these options to extract only the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. A figure include command might be commented out, and we must ensure that we do not extract file names from commented lines.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures on One Line**: There can be multiple commands on a single line, and the parser must be able to handle this case.\n\n7. **Figure Environments**: Figures are often included within a `figure` environment. The parser should recognize figures within these environments, as well as those included outside of them.\n\n8. **Custom Commands or Macros**: A user can define custom commands or macros that include figures, which may not follow standard LaTeX syntax for including figures. These cases will be very hard to parse without knowledge of the custom commands.\n\n9. **Different File Types**: Figures could be in different file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf), and the parser should be prepared to handle various types.\n\nTo accurately extract all figure file names from the LaTeX input, the parser needs to robustly handle all these potential challenges."
