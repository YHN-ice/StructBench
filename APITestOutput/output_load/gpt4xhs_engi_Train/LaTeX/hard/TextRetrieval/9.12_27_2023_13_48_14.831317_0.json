If such custom commands are used in the file, identifying them would require parsing the preamble of the document and understanding user-defined macros.\n\n3. **Multiple Formats**: Bold text could be formatted with different LaTeX commands, not just `\\textbf` or `{\\bfseries ...}`, but also through custom environments or other more complex methods.\n\n4. **Comments**: Text within comments (lines starting with `%`) should not be considered part of the document and thus should be ignored. Bold text inside comments should not be extracted.\n\n5. **Braces Matching**: It is crucial to correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the correct text within the bold commands.\n\n6. **Incomplete or Broken Commands**: If the LaTeX file contains syntax errors, such as an unclosed brace for a `\\textbf{...}` command, it would be challenging to extract the intended bold text correctly.\n\n7. **Alternative Formatting Packages**: Some documents may use alternative packages for formatting which include additional or different commands for bold text.\n\nOnce we have the actual LaTeX input file, we will need a systematic way to parse through the content and extract the bold texts while handling these potential issues."
