However, users might also use `\\bf{}`, `\\bfseries`, or custom commands defined in the preamble that set text to bold.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text might be nested inside other formatting commands or environments, such as italic `\\textit{}`, underline `\\underline{}`, or custom environments. This can make parsing more complex as we need to identify the bold command within others.\n\n3. **Braces Matching**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to delimit the argument of a command. Bold text might have multiple levels of braces, or include other commands that also use braces. We need to correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the entire bold text.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Comments (starting with `%`) or code that is inactive (e.g., within a `\\iffalse ... \\fi` block) may contain bold commands that should not be included in the extraction.\n\n5. **Custom Styles and Classes**: The document might be using custom styles or document classes that define bold in a non-standard way.\n\n6. **Inline vs. Block Formatting**: Bold text might be inlined within a paragraph or set as a block (e.g., within a `{\\bfseries ...}` block). The parser should handle both cases.\n\n7. **Multiple Bold Sections**: There might be multiple sections of bold text throughout the document, and all instances need to be extracted.\n\n8. **Split Braces**: Sometimes, the opening and closing braces for a command might be split across lines or separated by comments, making it difficult to parse without considering the whole document structure.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts from a LaTeX file, the parser must be capable of handling all these potential issues."
