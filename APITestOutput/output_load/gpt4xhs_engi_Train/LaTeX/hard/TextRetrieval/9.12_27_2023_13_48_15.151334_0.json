Identifying all the possible ways bold could be applied is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands. For instance, a bold command could be inside an italic or underline command, which makes parsing more complex.\n\n3. **Environment usage**: Bold text could also be applied within environments, such as within a `theorem` environment that automatically sets text to bold.\n\n4. **Custom environments and macros**: Authors can define custom macros or environments that change the text to bold. Recognizing these would require parsing macro definitions.\n\n5. **Comments**: The LaTeX file may contain comments that include the bold command but are not meant to render as part of the document.\n\n6. **Brace matching**: When extracting the text between `\\textbf{}` braces, it’s important to correctly match opening and closing braces, especially if there are nested braces.\n\n7. **Incomplete commands**: If the LaTeX file is malformed with incomplete bold commands, it might be difficult to correctly extract the content.\n\n8. **Conditional text**: Some text might only be rendered in bold under certain conditions using LaTeX conditionals.
