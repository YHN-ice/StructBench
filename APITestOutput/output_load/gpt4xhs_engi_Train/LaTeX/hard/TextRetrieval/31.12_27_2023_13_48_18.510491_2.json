Multiple figures in one command: There could be instances where multiple figures are included within a single figure environment or even within a single command using subfigure packages.\n\n5. File path issues: Figures may be included with relative or absolute paths, and sometimes the file extension is omitted in the LaTeX command.\n\n6. Custom commands and macros: A LaTeX file might define custom commands or macros that encapsulate the figure inclusion, which would make it more complex to extract figure filenames directly.\n\n7.
