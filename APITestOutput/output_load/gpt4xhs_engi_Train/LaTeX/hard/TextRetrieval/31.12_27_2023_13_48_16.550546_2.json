These optional arguments are in square brackets before the curly braces which contain the filename, so I need to properly parse these to find the correct file path.\n\n3. **File Path Formats**: File paths can be given in various formats and may include relative or absolute paths. Sometimes the file extension is omitted in the LaTeX command, assuming that the TeX engine will find the right file.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: The `figure` environment might contain multiple `\\includegraphics` commands, or figures might be included using other environments or commands (like `subfigure` or `subcaption`).\n\n5. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX document, including figure inclusion commands, may be commented out. These should not be considered as actual content.\n\n6. **File Existence**: Just because a filename is included in the LaTeX document doesn't guarantee that the file exists. The parser's job is to extract filenames, not to verify file existence.\n\n7. **Environment Variability**: Different LaTeX environments (e.g., `figure`, `minipage`) and packages (e.g., `graphicx`, `subfig`) might change how figures are included and referenced.\n\nTo accurately extract all figure filenames, I would need to account for these complexities and ensure that the parser correctly interprets LaTeX syntax and structure."
