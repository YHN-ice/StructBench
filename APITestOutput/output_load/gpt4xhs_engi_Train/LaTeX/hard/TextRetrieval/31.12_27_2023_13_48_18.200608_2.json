Recognizing all possible commands is necessary.\n\n2. **File path complexity**: The file path to the figure could be complex, including directories, and could use different separators (e.g., `/` or `\\\\`). Parsing the path correctly is essential.\n\n3. **File name without extension**: Sometimes LaTeX files include graphics without specifying the file extension. The code should either infer it or list the names without extensions.\n\n4. **Multiple figures in one command**: It's possible to include multiple figures within a single command, especially within a `subfigure` environment.\n\n5. **Custom commands and environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments to include figures, which would not be recognized without custom parsing rules.\n\n6. **Comments and commented out lines**: Figure inclusion lines might be commented out, and thus should not be extracted as active figures.\n\n7. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command might contain optional arguments before the file name, which need to be ignored while parsing the file name.\n\nAddressing these challenges will require a robust parsing strategy that can recognize and handle the various ways figures can be included in a LaTeX document."
