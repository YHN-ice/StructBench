These would not be recognized without knowledge of these custom definitions.\n\n4. **Comments**: Text within comments, denoted by `%`, should not be treated as content, so any bold text within a comment should not be extracted.\n\n5. **Environments**: Bold text can also be within different environments, such as `itemize`, `enumerate`, or custom-defined environments. The parser needs to recognize and properly handle such cases.\n\n6. **Inline vs. Display**: Bold text may appear inline within a paragraph or as part of a displayed equation or separate line. The context might affect parsing.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of LaTeX commands but are escaped (e.g., `\\%`) should not be confused with command indicators.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, extracting all bold texts while avoiding these pitfalls would require careful parsing of the LaTeX file, potentially using regular expressions or a parsing library designed to understand LaTeX structure."
