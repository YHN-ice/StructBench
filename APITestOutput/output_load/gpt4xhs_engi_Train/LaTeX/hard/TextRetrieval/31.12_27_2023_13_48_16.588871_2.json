These need to be correctly parsed to identify the filename.\n\n3. **Relative and absolute paths**: Figure filenames can be specified with relative or absolute paths. The parser needs to handle both cases correctly.\n\n4. **File extensions**: File extensions may or may not be included in the LaTeX command. The parser should be able to handle the filename with or without an extension.\n\n5. **Multiple files in one command**: Sometimes, a single command may include multiple files (e.g., using wildcards like `*.jpg` or listing multiple files separated by commas). The parser must separate these cases into individual filenames.\n\n6. **Commented lines**: Lines that are commented out should not be considered, as they are not active in the LaTeX document.\n\n7. **File paths with spaces**: Filenames or paths with spaces can cause issues if not handled properly, since LaTeX may require special treatment for such paths (e.g., using quotes or double braces).\n\n8. **Custom commands or macros**: Some LaTeX documents define custom commands or macros to include figures, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\n9. **Environment-based inclusions**: Figures might be included within specific environments (like `figure` or `minipage`) that could have their own inclusion syntax or conventions.\n\n10. **Conditional compilation**: Some documents use conditional compilation (e.g., with `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`) that might change which figures are included in the document.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust LaTeX parser would need to employ a flexible and comprehensive approach to accurately extract all included figure filenames."
