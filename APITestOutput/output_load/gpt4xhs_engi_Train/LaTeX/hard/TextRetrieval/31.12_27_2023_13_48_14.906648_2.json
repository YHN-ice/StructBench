A parser must handle both cases.\n\n4. **Command Options**: Commands like `\\includegraphics` may have options within square brackets that precede the file name, which can complicate the pattern for extracting the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX files may contain comments (lines starting with `%`). If a figure include command is commented out, it should not be considered.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures, especially within figure environments or when using subfigure packages.\n\n7. **Inline Braces and Text**: There might be additional braces or text within the command that is not related to the file name.\n\n8. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document could define custom commands or environments for including figures which do not follow the typical patterns.\n\n9. **Environment Wrapping**: Figures might be included inside environments, like `figure`, which might affect how they are parsed.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, one might need to develop a sophisticated parsing algorithm that can handle all these cases, possibly using regular expressions or a dedicated LaTeX parser tool. If you provide the input file or an example command from the file, we can proceed with extracting the figure file names."
