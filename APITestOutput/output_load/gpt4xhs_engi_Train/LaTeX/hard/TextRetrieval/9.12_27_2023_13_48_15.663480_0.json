The parser needs to handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold commands could be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which adds complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n3. **Custom Commands**: Users can define their own commands in LaTeX that may change text to bold. These would not be recognized unless specifically accounted for.\n\n4. **Comments**: The parser should ignore text within comments, as they are not rendered in the final document. LaTeX comments start with `%`.\n\n5. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to define the scope of commands. The parser must correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the correct text.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Sections**: There could be multiple bold sections within the same line or paragraph, and the parser must be able to distinguish and extract each one separately.\n\n7. **Environment Handling**: Bold text could also be inside environments, like `\\begin{itemize}` or custom environments. These environments may affect how text is parsed.\n\n8. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands**: In a real-world scenario, the LaTeX file might have syntax errors or incomplete commands, which could confuse the parser.\n\n9. **Escaped Commands**: If a command is escaped (e.g., `\\textbackslash textbf{}`), it indicates that the command should be treated as regular text rather than a formatting command.\n\n10. **Conditional Formatting**: Text may be conditionally formatted based on certain LaTeX constructs or custom logic, which would require more advanced parsing to evaluate conditions.\n\nOvercoming these obstacles requires a robust parsing strategy, potentially involving regular expressions or even a full-fledged LaTeX parser depending on the complexity of the input files."
