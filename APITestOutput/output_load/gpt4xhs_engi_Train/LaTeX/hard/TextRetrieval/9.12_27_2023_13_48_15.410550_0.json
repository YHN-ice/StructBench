The most common command is `\\textbf{}` but users may also use `\\bf{}`, `\\bfseries` followed by the text within braces, or even custom commands defined in the preamble that result in bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text might be nested within other LaTeX commands or environments which could make it tricky to find and extract just the bold text.\n\n3. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to enclose the arguments of commands. Correctly identifying the matching braces that enclose the bold text is essential to extract the text accurately.\n\n4. **Custom Macros**: The document might define custom macros which change the default behavior of bold commands or encapsulate them, so without knowing these macros, extracting the bold text might be challenging.\n\n5. **Comments and Disabled Text**: Sometimes, text within a comment (after a `%` symbol) or within a conditional clause that is not enabled might be formatted as bold, but should not be considered as part of the output.\n\n6. **Multiple Instances and Overlapping Formats**: There might be multiple instances of bold text which could also overlap with other formatting (like italics, underline, etc.), making the extraction process more complex.\n\n7. **Environment-Specific Commands**: Some LaTeX environments might have their own rules for formatting text as bold, such as in tables or custom-defined environments.\n\n8. **Inline vs. Display Math Mode**: If the document includes math mode, the commands for making characters bold within math mode (e.g., `\\mathbf{}`) are different and need to be handled separately from text mode.\n\nTo handle these obstacles, the parser must be robust enough to understand and interpret LaTeX syntax accurately, including command definitions, nesting levels, and context-specific formatting."
