Handling these environments correctly would be necessary.\n\n4. **Comments**: Text that appears to be bold within comments (anything after the `%` symbol on a line) should not be considered as part of the document content.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: LaTeX source might split bold commands over multiple lines, which would require careful parsing to ensure complete text extraction.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Special characters that are escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\%`, `\\$`, `\\&`) should be handled correctly in the output.\n\n7. **Conditional Text**: Some text might be conditionally bolded using LaTeX conditionals (e.g., `\\if ... \\textbf{...} \\fi`), which would require evaluating those conditions or recognizing that the text may be conditionally formatted.\n\nWithout seeing the actual LaTeX input file, we cannot determine which of these challenges are present, but these are common issues that might arise when parsing LaTeX documents for bold text."
