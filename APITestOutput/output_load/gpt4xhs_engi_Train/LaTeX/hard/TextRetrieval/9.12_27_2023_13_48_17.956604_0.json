Such cases would require understanding of the environment's behavior to extract bold text correctly.\n\n7. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Bold text might be split across lines or contain significant whitespace that should be preserved in the output.\n\nAddressing these challenges would require a thorough parsing of the LaTeX file while being aware of LaTeX's syntax rules and document structure."
