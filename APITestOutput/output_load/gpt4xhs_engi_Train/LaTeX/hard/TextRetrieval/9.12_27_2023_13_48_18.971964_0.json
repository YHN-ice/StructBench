Multiple commands for bold text: LaTeX has multiple commands that can make text bold, such as `\\textbf{}` and `\\bfseries`. We need to look for all possible commands that could indicate bold text.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text commands could be nested within other formatting commands or environments, so proper parsing is necessary to extract just the bold text without any formatting codes.\n\n3. Braces matching: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to denote the scope of a command. Proper brace matching is necessary to ensure we extract the complete text that is meant to be bold.\n\n4. Commented-out text: In LaTeX, lines or parts of the text can be commented out using `%`. Anything after a `%` on a line should be ignored by the parser, as it is not part of the final document.\n\n5. Custom macros: A LaTeX document may define custom macros that change text to bold. Without knowledge of these macros, the parser might miss some bold text.\n\n6. Multiple lines: The argument for the bold command could span multiple lines, so the parser should be able to handle multi-line input.\n\n7. Special environments: LaTeX has special environments like `itemize` or `enumerate`, which might change how text is interpreted. If these contain bold text, the parser needs to account for them.\n\n8. Escape characters: The parser should also handle cases where the backslash (`\\`) is used to escape characters, ensuring that these are not mistakenly treated as LaTeX commands.\n\nTo correctly extract bold text, the parser must handle all these situations appropriately. Now, please provide the LaTeX input file so we can proceed with extracting the bold texts."
