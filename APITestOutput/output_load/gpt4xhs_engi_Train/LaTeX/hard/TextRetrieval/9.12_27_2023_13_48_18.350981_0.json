We need to identify all possible ways bold text can be encoded.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text may include other formatting commands or environments nested within it. Properly extracting the bold text would require handling these nested structures.\n\n3. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: The bold text command might span multiple lines or have irregular white space, which makes simple parsing more difficult.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol which can cause lines to be ignored during compilation. If a bold command is commented out, it shouldn't be extracted as part of the text.\n\n5. **Custom Macros**: Sometimes, LaTeX files define custom macros which could change the way text is parsed. These would need to be understood and accounted for.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Sections**: There may be multiple separate sections of bold text. We need to ensure that all are extracted and properly separated.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Special characters in LaTeX that are escaped (like `\\%` or `\\$`) should not affect the parsing of the bold text but need to be handled correctly.\n\nConsidering these potential challenges, we can proceed with parsing the LaTeX file once it is provided and attempt to extract all bold texts as requested."
