Text within `%` signs or in comment environments should be ignored.\n\n5. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to delimit the scope of commands, and ensuring proper brace matching is essential to correctly extract the argument to bold commands.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Segments within a Single Scope**: There could be more than one segment of bold text within a single command scope, possibly separated by other text or commands.\n\n7. **Line Breaks and Whitespaces**: Line breaks and whitespaces could be present within the bold text command, which needs to be handled correctly to extract the complete content.\n\n8. **Special Characters**: Special characters in LaTeX such as `&`, `%`, `$`, etc., might be present in the bold text and need to be dealt with accordingly.\n\nTo navigate these obstacles, the parser must be robust enough to handle different LaTeX constructs and resilient against irregularities in the document structure.
