However, some documents may define custom commands or wrappers around `\\includegraphics`, which would require recognizing these patterns as well.\n\n2. **Variety of options and parameters**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have various options and parameters that modify how the file is included. These options might be inline within the brackets `[]` or spread across multiple lines, which makes parsing more challenging.\n\n3. **Relative and absolute paths**: The figures could be included using relative or absolute paths. We need to account for both types of paths when extracting the file names.\n\n4. **File extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command, and other times they omit it (since LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type). We need to handle both cases.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX comments, which begin with `%`, might contain lines that resemble `\\includegraphics` commands but are actually commented out and thus not part of the document content.\n\n6. **Multiple figures in one command**: In some cases, LaTeX allows including multiple figures within a single command (e.g., using `\\subfigure` or `\\subfloat`). Parsing these correctly to get all the individual file names may require additional logic.\n\n7. **Figures included in other environments**: Figures might not be directly included in the root document but within other environments or nested structures (like figures inside a `minipage` or custom-defined environments). We need to recognize these scenarios as well.\n\n8. **Figures included from external files**: Sometimes figures are not directly included in the main LaTeX file but from external files using commands like `\\input` or `\\include`. Tracking down these files to extract figure names from them could be necessary.\n\n9. **Conditional inclusions**: There might be conditional statements (such as `\\if`...`\\fi`) that determine whether a figure is included or not. Parsing these conditions requires understanding the LaTeX conditionals.\n\n10. **Robustness and edge cases**: A parser must be robust against edge cases, like escaped commands (e.g., `\\\\includegraphics`) or malformed input that doesn't follow standard LaTeX syntax.\n\nOnce we receive the input LaTeX file content, we would address these potential difficulties accordingly by implementing targeted parsing strategies to accurately extract all"
