Different commands for bold text: In LaTeX, bold text can be specified using various commands such as `\\textbf{}`, `\\bfseries` in combination with a group or environment, or even custom-defined commands in the document preamble. Identifying all the possible ways bold text can be encoded is crucial.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which can make it tricky to correctly identify and extract the bold text without including unwanted content.\n\n3. Handling braces: The correct matching of opening and closing braces `{}` is essential because they define the scope of the bold command. An incorrect interpretation of these braces could lead to partial or incorrect extraction of text.\n\n4. Custom styling commands: A user might define their own command for bold text in the preamble with `\\newcommand`, which would require parsing the preamble to identify these custom commands before extracting their usage in the document.\n\n5. Conditionals and optional arguments: Bold text might be included as part of conditional statements or within optional arguments to commands, making the parsing more complex.\n\n6. Comments: Text within comments, denoted by the `%` symbol, should not be extracted as they are not part of the compiled document.\n\n7. Multi-line and inline usage: Bold text commands might span multiple lines or be used inline with other text. Properly handling these cases is important for accurate extraction.\n\nBefore parsing the file, these are some of the potential difficulties that might need to be addressed in order to correctly extract all bold texts from a LaTeX file."
