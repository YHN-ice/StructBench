In the cases where the extension is not specified, the parser must acknowledge that LaTeX is capable of using default extensions (like .png, .jpg, .eps, etc.).\n\n4. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options that alter the inclusion, such as scale, width, height, angle, etc. These need to be properly ignored to extract the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX begin with `%`. If a figure inclusion line is commented out, it should not be considered.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command may include multiple figures (e.g., with subfigure packages).\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document could have custom commands or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics` or similar commands to include figures.\n\n8. **Environment Context**: Figures might be included within different environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), which do not impact the inclusion but may affect how the parser reads the file.\n\n9. **Inline vs. Block Commands**: Figure inclusion commands could be placed inline with other text or on separate lines, possibly affecting the parsing logic.\n\n10. **File Name Complexity**: File names might contain spaces, special characters, or multiple dots which could complicate extraction.\n\nGiven these potential issues, once we see the input file content, we will carefully construct our logic to handle these cases and accurately extract all figure file names."
