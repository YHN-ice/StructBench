Identifying all such commands is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested commands:** Bold text might be nested inside other commands or environments, which may complicate extraction. For example, `\\textbf{\\textit{bold and italic}}` would require parsing to extract just the bold part.\n\n3. **Braces balancing:** LaTeX uses braces `{}` to define the scope of commands. Ensuring proper balancing of braces is essential to correctly determine the start and end of the bold text.\n\n4. **Comments and non-printing characters:** Text within comments (anything after `%` on a line) should not be considered, and special characters or commands (like `\\\\` for new lines or `\\&` for the ampersand symbol) need to be handled appropriately.\n\n5. **Custom environments:** If the LaTeX file defines custom environments or includes packages that change the way bold text is handled, this could affect the extraction process.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text:** Bold text might span multiple lines or even paragraphs, and a parser must handle line breaks and whitespace correctly to extract the entire bold text without cutting it off at line ends.\n\nAddressing these obstacles will depend on the complexity of the LaTeX file in question and may require a robust parsing algorithm or a LaTeX-aware tool that can interpret the structure of the content."
