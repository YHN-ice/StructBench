We need to be able to handle and parse different path styles.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: LaTeX sometimes omits the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command because it can automatically determine the type of the file. We need to be aware that some included figures may not have explicit file extensions in the LaTeX source.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: LaTeX allows for including multiple figures within one command, particularly within a figure environment that may contain subfigures. We'll need to extract each included file separately.\n\n5. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX file might be commented out, including figure inclusion commands. We should not extract figures from comments since they are not actually included in the final document.\n\n6. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that include figures, which would require us to understand those custom definitions to correctly extract figures.\n\n7. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments for scaling, rotating, etc., which might complicate the extraction of the filename.\n\n8. **Complex File Names**: File names might include spaces or special characters that are handled specifically in LaTeX, requiring careful parsing to ensure accurate extraction.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful consideration and potentially robust parsing logic to accurately extract all figure file names from a LaTeX document."
