Figures referenced within comments should not be counted as included figure files.\n6. **Multiple figures in one command:** Sometimes, a single `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple files, typically separated by commas.\n7. **Custom commands or macros:** Users can define custom commands in LaTeX, which might obscure direct references to figure files.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that might be faced when attempting to accurately extract figure filenames from a LaTeX document.
