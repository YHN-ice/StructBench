The parser should be prepared to handle both scenarios.\n\n5. **Commented Lines**: Lines that are commented out should not be processed, but it's common for LaTeX users to comment out a line temporarily.\n\n6. **Nested Files**: The LaTeX file might use `\\input` or `\\include` commands to include content from other files, which may themselves include figures.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Macros**: Users might define custom macros to include figures, which would require the parser to understand those macros or ignore them.\n\n8. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, LaTeX users may include multiple figures in one command (e.g., using a loop or comma-separated lists).\n\n9. **Environment Consideration**: Figures might be included inside different environments, like `figure`, `minipage`, or even user-defined environments.\n\n10. **Error Handling**: The parser should gracefully handle errors or unexpected input in the LaTeX file that could otherwise disrupt the extraction process.\n\nTo accurately parse the LaTeX file and extract the filenames, the parser must be equipped to handle these complexities and be robust against various LaTeX practices and edge cases."
