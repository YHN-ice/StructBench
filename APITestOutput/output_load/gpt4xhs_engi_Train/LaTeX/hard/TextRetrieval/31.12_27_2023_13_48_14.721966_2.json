The parser has to correctly resolve these paths and determine the actual file names.\n\n3. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` sign. An include command within a comment should not be considered.\n\n4. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options, like scaling or rotation parameters, that are included in square brackets before the file name. The parser should ignore these options and only extract the file name.\n\n5. **Brace Styles**: File names could be enclosed with curly braces `{}` or without them. The parser should handle both cases.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Some LaTeX packages allow including multiple figures with a single command, for example with subfigures. These cases need to be properly handled to extract all file names.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments**: If the document defines custom commands or environments to include figures, the parser must understand these to extract the file names correctly.\n\n8. **Environment Scopes**: The file name might be defined within an environment, like `figure` or `minipage`, which could affect how the parser retrieves the file name.\n\n9. **Cross-referencing and Labels**: Sometimes, labels or cross-references might be confused with file names if not appropriately parsed.\n\n10. **File Names with Spaces or Special Characters**: LaTeX may use special syntax to handle file names with spaces or special characters, making it challenging to extract the correct name.\n\n11. **Conditional Inclusion**: LaTeX files might include conditionals (like `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`) that conditionally include graphics. The parser should recognize and handle these conditions properly.\n\nThese represent just a few of the potential issues that could complicate extracting figure file names from a LaTeX document.
