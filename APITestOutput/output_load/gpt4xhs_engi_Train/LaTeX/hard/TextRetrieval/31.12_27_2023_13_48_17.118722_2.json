The parser needs to be aware of all these possibilities.\n\n2. **File Extensions**: The figures might not always include file extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.pdf` in the LaTeX source, as LaTeX can often find the appropriate file without the extension being specified.\n\n3. **File Paths**: File paths can be absolute or relative, and they might involve complex directory structures. The parser should correctly handle different path notations.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: Sometimes, multiple `\\includegraphics` commands can be included on a single line, separated by other LaTeX commands or text.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX comments start with `%` and extend to the end of the line. The parser should ignore any figure inclusions within comments.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can include optional arguments for scaling, rotation, etc., which might complicate the extraction of the file name if not handled properly.\n\n7. **Figure Environments**: Figures are often enclosed within a `figure` environment, but not always. The parser shouldn't rely solely on this environment to find figures.\n\n8. **Robustness**: The parser should be robust against unusual syntax or formatting that may be present in the LaTeX file.\n\n9. **Custom Macros or Environments**: If the LaTeX file defines custom macros or environments that are used to include figures, recognizing these can be challenging unless the parser is specifically coded to understand them.\n\nOnce the input LaTeX file is provided, I will look for the inclusion of graphics typically indicated by the `\\includegraphics` command while taking into consideration these potential difficulties to accurately extract all figure file names."
