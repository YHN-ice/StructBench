The most common command for bold text in LaTeX is `\\textbf{}`, but there can be variations depending on the document class or included packages. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Variation in Commands**: LaTeX may use different commands for bold text, such as `\\bf`, `\\bfseries`, or a custom command defined in the preamble that wraps one of these standard commands.\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands, such as italics or underline, which may complicate the extraction process.\n3. **Grouping and Scopes**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to indicate the scope of a command. Extracting text will require correctly parsing these groupings to find where the bold command starts and ends.\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments in the text using the `%` symbol. Any bold commands within comments should not be considered.\n5. **Environment Blocks**: Bold text might be within an environment block (like `itemize`, `enumerate`, etc.), which may require additional parsing rules.\n6. **Custom Environments**: If the LaTeX document defines custom environments, these may alter or define new ways to make text bold.\n\nThe challenge lies in correctly identifying and extracting the text that is specifically meant to be bold while ignoring false positives (such as words \"textbf\" appearing in regular text) and handling the various LaTeX constructs and custom definitions that could exist in the document."
