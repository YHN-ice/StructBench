The filename is usually given within curly braces following this command.\n\nSome potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered when trying to extract figure file names from a LaTeX document include:\n\n1. Multiple graphics paths: LaTeX can use the `\\graphicspath` command to define multiple directories where it looks for images. This can complicate the extraction of file names because the path may not always be explicitly stated in the `\\includegraphics` command.\n\n2. Optional arguments: The `\\includegraphics` command can include optional arguments before the filename, inside square brackets. These options may control the width, height, rotation, and other attributes of the figure. It's important not to confuse these arguments with the filename.\n\n3. Filename without extension: LaTeX does not require the extension of the image file to be specified in the `\\includegraphics` command. When extracting file names, we must be aware that some may not include an extension.\n\n4. Multiple figures in one command: The `\\includegraphics` command might be used inside other environments or commands, like `\\figure` or `\\subfigure`, that could include multiple images in a single command.\n\n5. Custom commands or macros: The document could define custom commands that wrap `\\includegraphics` or figure environments, which would require more complex parsing to identify the included images.\n\n6. Commented out figures: Some figure inclusion commands might be commented out in the LaTeX source code. These should not be extracted as actively included figures.\n\n7. Varied figure environments: Besides `\\includegraphics`, LaTeX can include images with other environments like `tikzpicture`, which might reference external files in a different syntax.\n\nTo provide a correct answer, these potential difficulties must be considered during the parsing process."
