One must identify all possible commands used for bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting commands, such as italic or underlined text, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Command Parameters**: Bold commands may include optional parameters that need to be properly handled to extract only the text intended to be bold.\n\n4. **Environment Blocks**: Bold text may be inside environment blocks like `itemize`, `enumerate`, or custom environments, which may affect how text should be extracted.\n\n5. **Comments and Non-Text Contexts**: LaTeX comments (`%`) or bold text used in a context that is not printed (such as within a `\\label{}` command) should be ignored.\n\n6. **Custom Macros**: The document may define custom macros that result in bold text, which would require parsing and understanding the macro definitions.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Special characters might be escaped (like `\\%`), which complicates determining whether a sequence is a command or regular text.\n\n8. **Non-Standard Packages**: If the document uses non-standard packages to handle text formatting, one would need to account for those when parsing the document.\n\n9. **Conditional Text**: Some text may be conditionally bolded based on logic programmed into the LaTeX file, which would require evaluating those conditions.\n\nFor each of these potential issues, one would need to create rules or algorithms to correctly identify and extract the bold text while ignoring false positives and handling all LaTeX intricacies appropriately."
