Anything after this symbol on a line is a comment and should be ignored by the parser.\n\n6. **Brace styles**: File names could be enclosed in curly braces `{}`, or sometimes without braces when there are no spaces in the file names.\n\n7. **Multiple figures in one command**: The `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple files in one line, especially when used with subfigures.\n\n8. **Custom commands**: The document might define custom commands for including figures, which would require understanding of those custom definitions to extract file names correctly.\n\n9. **Environment contexts**: Figures are often included within a `figure` environment or a `minipage` environment, and we need to ensure that we’re extracting file names in the correct context.\n\nThese are just some of the things we need to consider when designing a robust parser for LaTeX figure extraction.
