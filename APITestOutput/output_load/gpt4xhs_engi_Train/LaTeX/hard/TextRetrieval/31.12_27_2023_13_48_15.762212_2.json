We need to consider whether to infer common extensions like `.png`, `.jpg`, `.eps`, etc.\n\n4. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: File paths can be given relative to the LaTeX document or as absolute paths. Both need to be handled correctly.\n\n5. **Comments**: Figures included within comments should not be considered, so it's critical to ignore anything after a `%` symbol that indicates a commented line.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Some LaTeX packages allow for including multiple figures within the same command, like subfigures.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Environments**: Users might define new commands or environments which internally use `\\includegraphics` but are not directly apparent in the document.\n\n8. **Figure Environments**: Figures might be included within figure environments and other floats, and the relevant commands may have surrounding text or LaTeX code.\n\nBy anticipating these issues, we can approach the question more effectively after seeing the input file.
