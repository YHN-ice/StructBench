The parser must recognize all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Commands:**\n   Bold text might be nested within other commands or environments.

Bold text within comments should not be extracted. Similarly, text that is conditionally included might require more complex parsing logic.\n\n4. **Complex Environments:**\n   In some cases, bold text might be within more complex environments like tables or custom-defined blocks, which could make it harder to extract without considering the environment's impact on formatting.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Erroneous Code:**\n   The LaTeX file might contain errors or incomplete commands that would confuse a simple parser.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a robust parser needs to be developed that can understand and replicate the behavior of a LaTeX compiler to some extent, recognizing and appropriately handling different contexts where bold text can occur."
