We should identify all the possible commands that denote bold text.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested inside other commands or environments, which could make it harder to extract just the bold parts cleanly without including other formatting or text.\n\n3. **Braces matching**: LaTeX commands use braces `{}` to encapsulate the text they are affecting. Extracting the text would require correctly matching opening and closing braces, including handling cases where braces are nested.\n\n4. **Optional arguments**: Some LaTeX commands may include optional arguments that are included in square brackets `[]` before the curly braces `{}`. These should not be confused with the text that is meant to be bold.\n\n5. **Comments and line breaks**: Comments in LaTeX are denoted by `%` and should be ignored when parsing the file. Additionally, line breaks and whitespace may not be consistent, requiring the parser to handle them appropriately.\n\n6. **Custom macros**: The document might define custom macros that change the behavior of how text is rendered as bold, which would require a more complex parsing strategy to handle.\n\n7. **Environment-based formatting**: Sometimes an entire environment (e.g., `\\begin{theorem}`) may be set to display its content in bold, which may not use explicit bold commands within the content itself.\n\n8. **Incomplete or malformed commands**: The LaTeX file may contain errors or incomplete commands that could confuse the parser if it is expecting well-formed LaTeX code.\n\n9. **Special characters and escape sequences**: Special characters in LaTeX (like `%`, `{`, `}`, `&`, `#`, etc.) and escape sequences (such as `\\&`) need to be handled properly during parsing.\n\nFor any LaTeX parsing task, including extracting bold text, correctly handling these issues would be crucial for an accurate extraction of content."
