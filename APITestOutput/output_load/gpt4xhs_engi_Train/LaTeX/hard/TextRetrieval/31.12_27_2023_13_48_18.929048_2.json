Identifying all possible commands that might include a figure is necessary.\n\n2. **File Extensions**: LaTeX allows including graphics without specifying the file extension. This means we might have to infer or search for possible extensions based on the provided filename.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Figures might be included using both relative and absolute paths. The parser needs to handle different path specifications correctly.\n\n4. **Comments**: Lines in a LaTeX file can be commented out using the `%` symbol. The parser must ignore commented lines to avoid extracting filenames from them.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures, especially within a loop or a custom command. The parser should be able to handle such situations.\n\n6. **Figure Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command may have options within square brackets before the file path that could complicate the parsing. The parser needs to differentiate between options and the actual file path.\n\n7. **Environment Considerations**: Figures are often included within figure environments or other custom environments. The parser should consider these environments to correctly identify figure inclusions.\n\n8. **File Path Complexity**: File paths can have complex structures including directories, subdirectories, and may contain special characters that need careful handling.\n\n9. **Commands Spread Across Lines**: LaTeX allows commands to be spread across multiple lines, which could make it difficult to match and extract the filenames correctly if the parser expects single-line commands.\n\n10. **Custom Macros**: Users may define their own macros that wrap standard figure inclusion commands, so the parser might need to expand or understand these macros to find the included figures.\n\nTo address these issues, one would need a robust parsing strategy that can handle a variety of LaTeX syntax scenarios, possibly involving regular expressions, context-aware parsing, or even a full-fledged LaTeX parser."
