These options can be inside square brackets before the file name and need to be correctly parsed to extract the file name.\n\n3. **Path Specifications**: The file names might include relative or absolute paths, which means that the parser has to handle directories and subdirectories correctly.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension of the image, and sometimes they don't (since LaTeX can automatically determine the extension). The parser must be able to extract the file name with or without the extension.\n\n5. **Comments and Disabled Code**: The LaTeX file might contain comments or disabled code blocks that include figure commands, which should not be counted as included figures.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: There may be commands that include multiple figures at once (such as subfigures), which complicates the extraction process.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Macros**: There could be custom commands or macros defined in the document for including figures, which would not be recognized without understanding the macro definitions.\n\n8. **Environment Usage**: Figures might be included inside different environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), which may change how the inclusion command should be interpreted.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a robust LaTeX file parser needs to carefully handle these cases to accurately extract all included figure file names."
