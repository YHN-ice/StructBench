When parsing a LaTeX file to extract included figure files, several potential difficulties and obstacles might be encountered:\n\n1. **Multiple include commands**: LaTeX uses several different commands to include figures (e.g., `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, `\\include`). Each may have different syntax and options that must be identified and handled.\n\n2. **File path variations**: Figures may be included with relative or absolute paths, and they may reside in different directories. The parser must correctly resolve these paths.\n\n3. **File extensions**: LaTeX often allows for omitting the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command since it can automatically determine the type of the image. The parser must account for this and possibly infer the correct file type.\n\n4. **Multiple figures in one line**: It's possible to include multiple figures within a single line using various LaTeX constructs. The parser must be capable of recognizing and separating these instances.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. If an include command is commented out, it should not be considered by the parser.\n\n6. **Complex commands**: Figures may be included within complex environments or custom commands, which might obscure the direct inclusion making it harder to parse.\n\n7. **Options in include commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command, for example, can contain various optional arguments that modify the inclusion (like scaling, rotation, etc.). These should be parsed accurately to extract only the filename.\n\n8. **Brace styles**: LaTeX is flexible with braces, allowing for curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]` for options, and even sometimes round parentheses `()`. The parser needs to handle these variations correctly.\n\n9. **Cross-platform differences**: File paths may use different directory separators on different operating systems (e.g., forward slash `/` on Unix-like systems and backslash `\\` on Windows).\n\n10. **Encoding issues**: LaTeX files can be saved with different text encodings, which could affect string parsing if not handled correctly.\n\nTo properly extract the figure filenames, these obstacles must be taken into account.
