It is necessary to extract only the bold text while correctly handling nested commands.\n\n3. **Brace Balancing**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` for command arguments. Extracting text from within these braces requires correctly handling nested braces and not mistaking braces used for other purposes as command arguments.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Text within comments (`%`) should not be considered part of the document content. Also, there might be conditional LaTeX code that is not active in the final document.\n\n5. **Environment Handling**: Some environments might change the way text is formatted, including making all text within them bold. It is important to recognize and handle such environments correctly.\n\n6. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: LaTeX is mostly agnostic to whitespace and line breaks, so they should be handled properly during parsing to ensure only the relevant text is extracted.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a parser must be able to recognize and process LaTeX commands, handle nested structures, ignore comments, and manage whitespace appropriately.
