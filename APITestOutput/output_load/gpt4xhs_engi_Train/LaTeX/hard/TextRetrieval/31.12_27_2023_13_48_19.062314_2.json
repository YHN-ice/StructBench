Variations in command syntax: Users can write LaTeX commands with optional arguments in different ways, e.g., `\\includegraphics[width=3cm]{example.png}` vs `\\includegraphics{example.png}`. The parser should handle these variations.\n\n3. Relative and absolute paths: Figures might be included using relative or absolute paths, and the parser must be able to extract the file name correctly in each case.\n\n4. File name extensions: The LaTeX file might include the extension of the figure file or omit it. The parser should be prepared to handle both cases.\n\n5. Commented out lines: Sometimes, lines including figures might be commented out using the `%` symbol. The parser should ignore these lines.\n\n6. Multiple figures in one command: A single command might include multiple figures, particularly within figure environments or subfigure commands.\n\n7. Custom commands and environments: The document might define custom commands or environments that include figures, which would require the parser to understand these definitions to extract the file names.\n\n8. Enclosed environments: Figures could be included inside nested environments, and the parser must correctly traverse these to find the figure commands.\n\n9. File path with spaces: If a file path includes spaces, it might be enclosed in double braces `{{...}}`, which the parser needs to account for.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parser would need a robust method to identify and process figure inclusion commands accurately while handling various scenarios and edge cases.
