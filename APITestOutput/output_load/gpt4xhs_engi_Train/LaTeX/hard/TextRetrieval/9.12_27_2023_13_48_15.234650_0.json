Recognizing all possible variations is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands may be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which could complicate parsing.\n\n3. **Brace Matching**: Since LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to indicate the scope of commands, correctly matching opening and closing braces is crucial, especially when they are nested.\n\n4. **Comments and Conditional Text**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` character, which should not be parsed as content. Additionally, conditionally included text (using `\\if`-`\\fi` constructs) may affect whether the bold text appears in the final document.\n\n5. **Custom Macros**: Users can define custom macros that may include bold text. Recognizing and properly handling these macros requires understanding the definitions or interpreting them correctly.\n\n6. **Environment Considerations**: Bold text may be part of specific environments (like `itemize`, `enumerate`, etc.), which might alter how the bold command is interpreted.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Special characters may be escaped in LaTeX (e.g., `\\%`), and correctly parsing these escapes is necessary to avoid misinterpretation.\n\nNow, please provide the LaTeX input file so I can attempt to extract the bold texts."
