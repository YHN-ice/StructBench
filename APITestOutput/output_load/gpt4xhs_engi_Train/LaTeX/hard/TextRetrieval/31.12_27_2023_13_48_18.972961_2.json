Improperly paired braces or missing braces could lead to difficulties in parsing.\n\n10. **Custom commands and macros**: Users might define custom commands or macros that internally use `\\includegraphics` but appear differently in the document.\n\nA robust parser will need to account for all these potential issues to correctly identify and extract all figure filenames from a LaTeX document."
