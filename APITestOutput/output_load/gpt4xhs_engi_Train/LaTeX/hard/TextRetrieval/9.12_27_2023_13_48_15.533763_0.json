This nesting could make it more difficult to correctly isolate the bold text.\n\n3. **Custom macros:** The document could define custom macros that apply bold formatting, which would require understanding the macro definitions to extract the bold text properly.\n\n4. **Brace matching:** LaTeX uses braces `{}` to define the scope of commands. It's important to correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the complete text that is meant to be bold.\n\n5. **Comments and non-printing characters:** The LaTeX source might contain comments (with `%`) or non-printing characters that should not be included in the extracted text.\n\n6. **Text across multiple lines:** The bold text in the LaTeX source code may span multiple lines, which requires handling line breaks and potential indentation correctly.\n\n7. **Special characters and LaTeX commands inside the text:** Bold text may include special characters (like `\\&`, `\\_`, etc.) or other LaTeX commands that need to be interpreted or stripped out as necessary.\n\n8. **Differences in versions or packages:** There might be differences in how bold text is represented depending on the LaTeX version or the packages used in the document.\n\nTo provide a correct answer, we'll need to carefully account for all these potential issues. Now, please provide me with the LaTeX file content so I can proceed with extracting the bold texts for you."
