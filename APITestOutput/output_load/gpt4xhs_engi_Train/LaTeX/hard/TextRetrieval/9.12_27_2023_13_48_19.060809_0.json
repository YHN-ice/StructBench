Recognizing these would require interpreting the macro definitions.\n\n5. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX start with `%` and continue to the end of the line. If a bold command is commented out, it should not be included.\n\n6. **Environments**: Bold text might be within an environment that changes the text to bold, such as a custom-defined environment in the preamble.\n\n7. **Conditional Text**: There might be conditional statements in the LaTeX source that include bold text which is conditionally included based on certain boolean flags or parameters.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, one needs to consider these potential issues and parse the file accordingly, ignoring comments, handling nested commands and environments, and properly interpreting custom commands and macros."
