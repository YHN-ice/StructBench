We need a strategy to extract only the text content while handling nested formatting commands properly.\n\n3. **Line breaks and comments**: LaTeX files might contain line breaks, comments, or other formatting that could interfere with simple string matching. We need to handle these appropriately.\n\n4. **Custom commands**: The document might define custom commands for bold text, and without knowing these commands, it may not be possible to extract all bold texts correctly.\n\n5. **Environment-based formatting**: Sometimes, text might be made bold by being placed within a certain environment that changes the font weight of all contained text (e.g., `{\\bfseries ...}`), rather than a specific command applied to the text itself.\n\n6. **Conditional formatting**: There might be conditional formatting based on LaTeX if-else statements that apply bold formatting only when certain conditions are met.\n\n7. **Command parameters**: The `\\textbf` command could be used inside the parameters of other commands or environments, where its effect might not be straightforward to interpret without parsing the whole structure.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, we would need to parse the LaTeX file considering these potential difficulties and extract only the relevant text that is actually displayed in bold once the document is compiled."
