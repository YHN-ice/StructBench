Bold text within a conditional block that isn't included in the final document might be tricky to identify and handle correctly.\n\n8. **Packages and macros**: There might be packages included in the preamble of the LaTeX file that change the behavior of the `\\textbf` command or provide additional ways to render text in bold.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, the parser will need to account for these potential issues and extract only the relevant bold text segments from the actual content of the LaTeX document, ignoring comments, handling nested constructs, and respecting any custom or conditional logic that impacts text formatting."
