Recognizing all possible ways bold text can be specified is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text commands may be nested inside other LaTeX commands or environments, and these cases need to be handled correctly.\n\n3. **Brace matching**: LaTeX commands often use curly braces `{}` to enclose the text they are affecting. The extraction process must correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the correct text.\n\n4. **Escape characters**: Some characters in LaTeX are special and must be escaped with a backslash `\\`. Depending on the context, these characters might not appear in the output or might be part of a command.\n\n5. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX begin with `%` and extend to the end of the line. Text within comments should not be extracted as part of the bold text.\n\n6. **Custom commands**: The document could contain custom commands defined with `\\newcommand` that specify bold text. These would not be immediately recognizable without parsing the definitions.\n\n7. **Conditional inclusion**: Portions of the LaTeX document may be conditionally included or excluded using commands like `\\if`, `\\else`, and `\\fi`. The parser must be aware of these conditions to extract text accurately.\n\n8. **Non-standard packages**: If the LaTeX file uses non-standard packages which redefine how bold text is specified, additional logic may be required to handle these cases.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file and understand its structure, I can proceed to determine which of these challenges are present and extract the bold texts accordingly."
