The parser needs to be ready to handle different extensions while excluding non-figure files.\n\n5. **Multiple figures in one command**: It’s possible to have multiple figures included within a single command, especially within figure environments or custom commands/macros users might define for convenience.\n\n6. **Comments and non-standard use**: Figures included within comments should not be extracted, and sometimes users manipulate standard commands for special purposes, which can complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Environment encapsulation**: Figures might be encapsulated in different environments (e.g., `figure`, `minipage`), which could affect how the file name is specified.\n\n8. **File name with spaces**: File names may contain spaces or special characters that are handled differently in LaTeX, such as using quotes or backslashes.\n\nA robust parsing approach would need to account for these potential issues to accurately extract all figure file names from a given LaTeX file."
