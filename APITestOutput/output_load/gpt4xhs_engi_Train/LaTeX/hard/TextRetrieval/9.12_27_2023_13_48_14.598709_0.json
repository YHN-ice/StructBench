We must ensure only the raw text within `\\textbf{}` is extracted, without any nested commands or their effects.\n\n2. **Multiple instances**: There may be multiple `\\textbf{}` commands in the file, and each one needs to be handled properly to extract all occurrences of bold text.\n\n3. **Line breaks**: The text within a `\\textbf{}` command may be broken across lines or contain LaTeX line breaks (`\\\\`). The parser must concatenate these lines to form the complete raw text.\n\n4. **Special characters**: LaTeX uses special characters (like `%`, `$`, `&`, `#`, `{`, `}`, etc.) that might be included in the bold text. These need to be handled correctly as per LaTeX conventions.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. Text within comments should not be treated as part of the document and hence not extracted.\n\n6. **Environment-based bolding**: Other than `\\textbf{}`, bold text can be created using environments like `{\\bfseries ...}`. The parser needs to handle such cases as well.\n\n7. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are escaped (e.g., `\\%`) should not be considered as comment initiators or special characters but as part of the text itself.\n\nThese are some potential issues that may need to be addressed in order to accurately extract all bold texts from a LaTeX file. Now, please provide the input LaTeX file so I can proceed with extracting the bold texts for you."
