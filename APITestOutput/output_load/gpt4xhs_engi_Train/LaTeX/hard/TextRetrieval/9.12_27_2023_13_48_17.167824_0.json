This diversity requires the parser to recognize all possible bold commands.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text might be nested inside other commands or environments, which could complicate extraction. For example, `\\textbf{some \\emph{important} text}` contains emphasized text within bold text.\n\n3. **Custom Macros**: Users can define their own macros to simplify their LaTeX writing. If a custom macro for bold text is defined, such as `\\newcommand{\\mybold}[1]{\\textbf{#1}}`, the parser would need to recognize it as well.\n\n4. **Comments**: The LaTeX file might contain comments with the `%` symbol. Any text within comments should not be considered part of the output even if it includes `\\textbf{}`.\n\n5. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to enclose the arguments of commands. Correctly matching opening and closing braces is necessary to extract the complete text that is meant to be bold.\n\n6. **Environment-based formatting**: Text within certain environments could be set to display as bold by default, such as within a `theorem` environment or when using `\\bfseries` within a scope. The parser must be aware of these contexts.\n\n7. **Incomplete or Broken Commands**: If the LaTeX source includes syntax errors or incomplete commands (e.g., an unclosed brace for `\\textbf{`), the parser needs to handle these cases gracefully.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of LaTeX syntax but are escaped to be displayed literally, like `\\{` or `\\}`, should not be misinterpreted as command syntax.\n\nBy keeping these potential difficulties in mind, we can attempt to accurately extract all bold texts once we receive the input file content."
