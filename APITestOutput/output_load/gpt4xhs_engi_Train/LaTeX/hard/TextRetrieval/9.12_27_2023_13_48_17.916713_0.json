In LaTeX, bold text can be specified using the `\\textbf{}` command or within the `\\bfseries` scope. Here are some potential challenges and obstacles in parsing the bold text:\n\n1. **Multiple Commands for Bold:** LaTeX has several commands for making text bold, such as `\\textbf{}`, `\\bf`, and `\\bfseries`. The parser needs to recognize all possible commands that denote bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Commands:** Bold commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which could make parsing more complex.\n\n3. **Command Parameters:** The bold commands may have optional parameters that need to be correctly handled and ignored during parsing.\n\n4. **Comments and Escaped Characters:** The LaTeX file may contain comments (using `%`) that could include bold commands which should not be parsed as they are not rendered. Also, escaped characters (like `\\\\textbf`) that are meant to display as text instead of being interpreted as a command should also be handled.\n\n5. **Custom Macros:** The document might define custom macros that change the text to bold, and these would not be recognized without parsing and understanding those macro definitions.\n\n6. **Environment Scopes:** Text might be made bold by being inside a particular environment that changes the text weight to bold, such as the `{\\bfseries ...}` environment.\n\n7. **In-line vs. Block:** Bold text might appear in-line with other text or as a block on its own. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n8. **Balanced Braces:** LaTeX commands rely on balanced curly braces `{}`, and parsing must ensure to correctly match opening and closing braces, even in complex nesting situations.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, the parser must correctly navigate through these potential issues and extract only the relevant text that is formatted to be bold."
