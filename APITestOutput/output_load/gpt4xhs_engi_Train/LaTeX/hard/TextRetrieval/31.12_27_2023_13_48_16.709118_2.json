One must recognize all possible commands that can be used to include figure files.\n\n2. **Different Path Specifications**: Figure files might be included using absolute or relative paths, and these paths could be nested within directories. The parser must correctly identify the file name amidst the path.\n\n3. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments (e.g., scale, width, height) that come before the file name; the parser needs to ignore these when extracting the file name.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes LaTeX allows including multiple figures within one command, especially within a figure environment. Handling such cases can add complexity.\n\n5. **Commented Out Lines**: Some lines may include commented out include commands which should not be considered as they are not actual figures included in the document.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The LaTeX file might define custom commands or environments that internally include figures. Without knowledge of these definitions, it could be difficult to identify included figures.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX compilers require the file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`) while others do not. The parser must handle both cases where the file extension is present or absent.\n\n8. **Files Included in Other Files**: If the LaTeX document is split across multiple files, figures may be included in files that are themselves included in the main file. Depending on the setup, these may or may not be directly visible in the main document.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it would be necessary for a LaTeX parser to be quite sophisticated to handle all possible cases of figure inclusion accurately."
