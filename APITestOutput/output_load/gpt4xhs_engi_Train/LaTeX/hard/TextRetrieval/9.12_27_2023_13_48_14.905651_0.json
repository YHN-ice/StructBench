The most common command is `\\textbf{...}`, but users can also define custom commands or environments that result in bold text. As the parser, I will need to be aware of all the ways bold text can be created.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: LaTeX allows for nested commands, so bold text may be within other formatting commands, which can complicate the extraction process. For example, `\\textbf{\\emph{...}}` would need to be parsed correctly to extract the bold text without the emphasis formatting.\n\n3. **Brace matching**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to denote the scope of formatting commands. I will need to correctly match opening and closing braces to ensure that I extract the complete bold text segments.\n\n4. **Custom and complex environments**: Users can define custom commands and environments that may not follow the standard syntax for bold text. If such customizations are present, they must be identified and handled appropriately.\n\n5. **Comments and inactive code**: The LaTeX file may contain comments (using `%`) or inactive code that should not be included in the extracted text.\n\n6. **In-line math mode**: If the document includes math mode text (using `$...$` or `\\[...\\]`), this can affect how text is parsed, especially since certain formatting commands behave differently or are not allowed in math mode.\n\n7. **Special characters**: Special characters in LaTeX (such as `\\`, `{`, `}`, `&`, `%`, `#`, etc.) can interfere with straightforward text extraction and need to be handled correctly.\n\n8. **Multiple files**: Sometimes, LaTeX projects are split across multiple files using `\\input` or `\\include` commands. If the bold text is in a separate file, it might be missed unless those files are also parsed.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust parsing strategy that understands the syntax and semantics of LaTeX is required."
