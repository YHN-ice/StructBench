We need to account for all possible ways bold text can be formatted.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text might be nested within other commands or environments, which could make it trickier to extract just the bold text without any additional formatting.\n\n3. **Comments and Escape Characters**: Bold commands may be commented out or escaped in the LaTeX file, which means they wouldn't actually produce bold text in the final document. We need to ignore these instances.\n\n4. **Incomplete or Broken Commands**: If the LaTeX file contains errors, such as incomplete `\\textbf{}` commands without the corresponding closing brace, it may be challenging to correctly parse the content.\n\n5. **Custom Commands and Macros**: The LaTeX file may define custom macros or commands that change the default behavior of bold commands. Without knowing these, we might miss some bold text.\n\n6. **Complex Formatting**: Bold text might be part of more complex formatting structures, such as tables or figures, where additional parsing logic would be required to extract just the text component.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, we'll need to carefully parse the file while considering various scenarios wherein bold text is used.
