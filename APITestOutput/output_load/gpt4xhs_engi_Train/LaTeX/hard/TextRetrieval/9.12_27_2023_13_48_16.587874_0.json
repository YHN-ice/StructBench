The most common command is `\\textbf{}`, but bold text could also be wrapped within `\\bf{}`, `\\bfseries`, or a custom command defined by the user.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which makes parsing more difficult. For instance, `\\textbf{\\textit{Bold and Italic}}` would need proper handling to only extract the bold text without the italic formatting.\n\n3. **Custom Macros**: The LaTeX document may have custom macros defined that internally use the bold text command. Identifying and interpreting these custom macros would require parsing and expanding them correctly.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX comments, which start with `%`, might contain bold commands that are not actually used in the final document. These should be ignored during parsing.\n\n5. **Environment-Based Formatting**: Bold text within environments such as `figure`, `table`, or `itemize` might follow different formatting rules or be part of captions and labels.\n\n6. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands**: Incorrectly closed or malformed bold text commands could lead to parsing issues, making it difficult to determine where the bold text starts and ends.\n\n7. **Other Packages**: LaTeX documents often use external packages that might introduce new ways to format bold text. These would need to be accounted for if they are used in the document.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parser would need to:\n\n- Accurately identify all the variations of bold text commands.\n- Handle nested formatting commands.\n- Ignore comments and properly handle environments.\n- Deal with custom macros and expand them if necessary.\n- Gracefully manage malformed or incomplete commands.\n- Be aware of external packages that might alter the standard behavior of bold text formatting."
