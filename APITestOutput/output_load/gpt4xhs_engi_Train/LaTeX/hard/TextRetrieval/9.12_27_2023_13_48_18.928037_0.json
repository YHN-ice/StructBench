Identifying all possible ways to denote bold text within the LaTeX file is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text might have nested commands inside it, such as italic or underline commands. Properly parsing these nested structures could be challenging.\n\n3. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Comments in LaTeX are denoted by `%` and should not be parsed as they are not part of the actual document content. Similarly, code that is commented out or within a `\\iffalse ... \\fi` block should be ignored.\n\n4. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The document may define custom commands or environments for bold text, which would need to be recognized and handled properly.\n\n5. **Complex Syntax**: LaTeX syntax can be quite complex with the use of braces and brackets for command parameters, optional arguments, etc. Ensuring that the parser correctly handles these without mistakenly capturing non-bold text is important.\n\n6. **Conditional Statements**: The LaTeX file may contain conditional statements that affect whether text is bold or not. These would need to be evaluated correctly.\n\n7. **Multiple Files**: Sometimes, LaTeX documents are split across multiple files using `\\input` or `\\include` commands. If the bold text is in a separate file, it would need to be located and parsed as well.\n\n8. **Environment-specific Commands**: Some commands may only create bold text within certain environments, so understanding the context in which a command is used is necessary.\n\n9. **Inline vs. Block Elements**: Bold text can appear inline with other text or as separate blocks. Ensuring that all instances are captured regardless of their format is needed.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we can better assess the best approach to parsing it and extracting the bold texts while taking into account these potential challenges."
