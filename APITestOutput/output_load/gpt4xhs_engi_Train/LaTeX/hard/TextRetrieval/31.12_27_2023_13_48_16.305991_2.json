Furthermore, the path can contain spaces or special characters that may need to be handled properly.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Not all LaTeX documents specify the file extension of the images being included. The command might omit the extension, and LaTeX will still render the image if it can find a file with the corresponding base name and an appropriate image extension.\n\n4. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can include options within square brackets before the file path, which could include additional text that needs to be parsed correctly to extract the actual file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX document, including figure inclusion commands, might be commented out with the `%` character, so it is important not to extract file names from commented lines.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, LaTeX users may include multiple figures within one command, such as subfigures or using loops. These instances will require careful parsing to extract all file names.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Environments**: Users might define custom commands or environments that internally include graphics. Without a definition of these commands or a way to parse them, it could be challenging to extract the filenames.\n\n8. **TeX Conditionals or Programming Constructs**: Some LaTeX documents may use conditional statements or other programming constructs that dynamically determine which images to include.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties would require a parser that can handle a variety of LaTeX syntaxes and is robust against common user variations and LaTeX constructs."
