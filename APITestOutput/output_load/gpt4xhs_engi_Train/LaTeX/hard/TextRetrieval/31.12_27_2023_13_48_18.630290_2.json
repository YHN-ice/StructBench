When extracting figure file names from a LaTeX document, several challenges and obstacles could arise:\n\n1. **Variations in Figure Inclusion Commands**: LaTeX can include figures using different commands such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\epsfig`, or other custom inclusion commands defined by the user.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: Figures might be included with relative or absolute paths, and these paths may contain directories and subdirectories, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX files may omit the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command, assuming a default, like `.png` or `.jpg`. This means we have to consider extensionless file names as well.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, LaTeX users include multiple figures within one command (e.g., using a loop or comma-separated values), which makes it harder to extract individual file names.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX files allow comments with `%`. If the figure inclusion line is commented out, it shouldn't be considered.\n\n6. **Graphics Packages Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command might include options, such as scale or width, which need to be ignored when extracting the figure name.\n\n7. **Conditional Inclusions**: LaTeX allows for conditional compilation (e.g., using `\\if` statements), which may or may not include certain figures depending on the conditions.\n\n8. **Custom Commands or Environments**: Users might define their own commands or environments that wrap around the standard figure inclusion commands.\n\n9. **Enclosed File Paths**: File paths that are enclosed in curly braces `{}` might have additional text or commands that are not part of the file path.\n\n10. **Non-standard Syntax**: Some users may employ non-standard LaTeX practices, which could make parsing more challenging.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help us devise a strategy for accurately extracting figure file names from the LaTeX document you provide."
