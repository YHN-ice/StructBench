The parser must be able to handle and extract the correct file name from such paths.\n\n3. **Optional arguments:** The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments for scaling, rotating, etc., which might complicate the pattern to match.\n\n4. **Commented lines:** LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` character. If a figure include command is commented out, it should not be considered.\n\n5. **Environment awareness:** Figures are often included inside a `figure` environment or wrapped in other custom commands or environments, which might affect how the include command is parsed.\n\n6. **File extensions:** Sometimes LaTeX source files specify the file extension of the graphic, and sometimes they do not (relying on LaTeX to automatically find the appropriate file). The parser has to account for both cases.\n\n7. **Complex file names:** File names might contain underscores, hyphens, or other characters that could complicate simple parsing strategies.\n\n8. **Different LaTeX distributions or custom commands:** There might be custom commands defined in the preamble or elsewhere that handle figure inclusion differently than standard LaTeX commands; identifying these would require parsing and understanding the entire document structure.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be carefully designed with pattern matching that considers these complexities.
