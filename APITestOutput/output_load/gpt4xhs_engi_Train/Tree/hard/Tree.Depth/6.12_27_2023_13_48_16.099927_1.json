Any misinterpretation of these relationships can lead to an incorrect depth calculation.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The parser must handle errors gracefully, such as missing nodes or references to non-existent nodes, which could impact the ability to determine the depth of a specific node.\n\n6. **Size and Scalability**: If the tree is very large, it might be difficult to process it efficiently.
