        "To find the height of the root node in a tree represented by the given edges, we can construct the tree and then perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.

Construct a data structure to represent the tree, typically an adjacency list, which maps each node to a list of its children.\n\n2. Perform a DFS starting from the root node, keeping track of the depth as you traverse the tree.\n\n3. Update the maximum depth whenever you reach a leaf node (a node with no children).\n\n4. Once the DFS is complete, the maximum depth will be the height of the root node.\n\nBased on the given input, we can see that 'i' is the root node since it does not appear on the right side of any input line.
