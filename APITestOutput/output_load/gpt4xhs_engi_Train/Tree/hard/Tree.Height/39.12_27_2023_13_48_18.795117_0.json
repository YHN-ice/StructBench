        "To find the height of the root node in the given tree, we do not necessarily need to parse a file. The information is provided in a textual edge list format, where each line represents an edge from a parent node to a child node. The height of the root node (\"n\" in this case) is the length of the longest path to any leaf node, with the leaf nodes themselves defined as having a height of 0.\n\nFrom the structure provided, we can see that the edges form paths that start from the root node \"n\" and branch out. To determine the height, we need to follow each path from \"n\" to its furthest leaf and count the edges.\n\nThe input text represents a tree structure in a parent->child relationship. Starting with the root node \"n\", we can see that it has only one direct child \"o\". So we start with a height of 1 (since there's one edge from \"n\" to \"o\") and move down one level to \"o\". We then continue this process, choosing the longest path at each decision point until we reach a leaf node. If we take the longest path each time, we ensure we find the maximum height.\n\nGiven the structure and assuming no cycles (which would invalidate the tree definition), we do not need to know the entire tree to find the longest path; we only need to follow the longest branch.\n\nHowever, since this is not a practical task to manually count and verify each possible path, if we were to write a program or script to parse this input and perform the calculation, we would likely perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the root node to find and return the maximum depth. This algorithm would account for all branches and return the maximum height found among them.\n\nAs this is not an executable environment and the input is too large to manually process within a reasonable time frame, I can't provide you with a direct answer without writing and running an actual program or having additional information that indicates which path from \"n\" down is the longest.\n\nTo provide an exact height value, you would typically run such a program or script on your dataset. If you need assistance writing such a script or if you have access to coding environments, I could assist you with pseudocode or actual code in a language like Python."
