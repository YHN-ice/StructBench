        "Given the sequential input of edges, where each edge is represented by a parent-child relationship (e.g., u->v means 'u' is the parent of 'v'), you want to calculate the height of the root node.

In this case, 'u' appears to be the root as it has no preceding nodes.\n\nTo find the height of the root node, you must traverse the tree and keep track of the longest path.
