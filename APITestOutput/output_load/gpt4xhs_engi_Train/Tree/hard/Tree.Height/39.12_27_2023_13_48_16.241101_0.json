        "From the input provided, we can see that it represents a tree with a series of edges from parent nodes to children nodes.

The height of the root node is defined as the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. A leaf node is a node with no children, and its height is 0.\n\nWe will construct the tree and calculate the height using a depth-first search approach.
