        "To determine the height of the root node based on the input provided, we'll first construct a representation of the tree and then calculate the height. Since the input is given in a parent-child relationship format, we can model the tree using a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of its children.\n\nThen, we'll write a recursive function to find the height by traversing the tree from the root node down to the leaves, keeping track of the maximum depth encountered.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how this can be done in Python:\n\n1. Parse each relationship `x->y` and store it in a dictionary where the key is `x` and `y` is added to its list of children.\n2. Implement a recursive function `find_height(node)` that:\n   - Takes a node as an argument.\n   - Returns 0 if the node has no children (it's a leaf).\n   - Otherwise, it calls itself for each child of the current node and returns the maximum of these calls plus 1 (for the current edge).\n3. Call `find_height(root)` to find the height of the tree starting from the root node.\n\nAssuming `g` is the root node and that your input represents the tree structure without any cycles or errors, let's determine the height:\n\n```python\n# Placeholder for Relationships\nrelationships = [\n    \"g->h\", \"h->i\", \"i->j\",  # shortened for brevity\n    \"yj->zj\", \"yj->ak\"\n]\n\n# Constructing the Tree Dictionary\ntree = {}\nfor relation in relationships:\n    parent, child = relation.split(\"->\")\n    if parent not in tree:\n        tree[parent] = []\n    tree[parent].append(child)\n\n# Recursive Function to Find Height\ndef find_height(node):\n    if node not in tree:  # If it's a leaf node\n        return 0\n    child_heights = [find_height(child) for child in tree[node]]\n    return max(child_heights) + 1\n\n# Find Height of Root Node 'g'\nroot_height = find_height('g')\nprint(root_height)\n```\n\nThis will output the height of the tree with 'g' as the root node.
