        "To calculate the height of the root node from the given edge list, we have to construct the tree and then find the longest path from the root to any leaf node. Since the representation is given as an edge list, we can parse it and construct a tree data structure (e.g., using a dictionary for adjacency lists) and then traverse the tree to find its height.\n\nA simple algorithm to find the height of a tree represented by an adjacency list would be to perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the root node and keeping track of the maximum depth encountered.\n\nGiven that the input edges represent a tree, there should be no cycles, and there should be one unique root node with no incoming edges. However, from the provided input, we can't directly identify the root node or construct the tree without additional context. Assuming `s` is the root (as it seems to be the starting node in your list), we can use a recursive DFS function to find the height.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Constructing the tree from the edge list\nedges = [\n    (\"s\", \"t\"),\n    # ... include all other edges here ...\n    (\"kk\", \"mk\"),\n]\n\ntree = defaultdict(list)\nfor parent, child in edges:\n    tree[parent].append(child)\n\n# Recursive function to calculate height\ndef find_height(node):\n    if node not in tree:  # If it's a leaf node\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Height is 1 + max height of any child\n        return 1 + max(find_height(child) for child in tree[node])\n\n# Assuming 's' is the root node\nheight_of_root = find_height('s')\nprint(height_of_root)\n```\n\nThis code constructs a tree as an adjacency list and then uses a recursive function to calculate its height. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree since each node is visited exactly once.\n\nUnfortunately, as I don't have an environment to execute code, I can't run this script.
