        "To calculate the height of the root node in a tree structure, we can traverse the tree and update the height as we discover deeper paths. Given the input as a list of edges in the form of \"parent->child\", we can build a tree data structure and recursively determine the maximum depth.\n\nFor this specific scenario, we can use the following approach:\n1. Parse the input and construct a tree representation (such as an adjacency list or a dictionary with parent nodes as keys and lists of child nodes as values).\n2. Start from the root node (the one with no parent).\n3. Recursively traverse the tree, keeping track of the current depth.\n4. Update the maximum depth each time we reach a leaf node (node with no children).\n5.

Since leaf nodes are defined to have a height of 0, we start counting from the root, which is one level above the first set of child nodes.
