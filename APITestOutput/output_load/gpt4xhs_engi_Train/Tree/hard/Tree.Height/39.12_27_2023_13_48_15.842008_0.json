        "The provided input describes a tree with edges directed from parent nodes to child nodes. Leaf nodes are those without children. To find the height of the root node (referred to as 'k' in this case), we need to find the longest path from the root node 'k' to any leaf node.\n\nThe process involves traversing the tree and keeping track of the depth of each node. Since the input is given in a text format where each line represents an edge, one way to tackle this would be to convert this representation into a data structure like an adjacency list that can store the tree.

If you have access to a programming environment, I would recommend writing a script to parse this tree structure and use DFS or BFS to find the longest path accurately. Assuming the visible longest path is indeed the longest, based on the provided input sample, a potential longest path has 8 edges, suggesting that could be the height of the root node.
