        "Based on the input provided, it appears to represent a tree structure using a parent-child notation, where each line specifies an edge from a parent node to a child node. To determine the height of the root node, we must parse this structure to create a tree and then find the longest path from the root to any leaf node.\n\nTo solve this, we'll employ a programming approach. First, we'll build a representation of the tree in memory by parsing the input lines into a data structure that captures the parent-child relationships, such as a dictionary or an adjacency list.
