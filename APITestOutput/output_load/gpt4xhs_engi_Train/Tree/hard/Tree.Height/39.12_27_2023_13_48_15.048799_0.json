        "Given the inputs, we can see that it represents a tree structure with edges defined from parent to child nodes. We can determine the height of the tree by finding the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.\n\nFrom the input, 's' is the root node, and we are to find the height by counting the number of edges in the longest path from 's' to any leaf node. To calculate the height manually, we must traverse from 's' to each of its deepest leaf nodes while counting the edges.
