        "Based on the provided input, which represents a tree structure with parent->child relationships, we need to determine the path from the root node to the node 'rj'. To find this path, we'll identify the sequence of nodes starting from the root and leading up to 'rj'.\n\nFirstly, we need to find the root. The root node is typically the one that has no parent. From the given list, we don't have a clearly defined root, but since you've mentioned \"root\" in the instructions, I'll assume node 'y' is the root based on its position at the start of the input.\n\nNow, we need to construct a map of parent-child relationships and then traverse it to find the path to 'rj'. Rather than an actual programmatic solution, I'll manually trace the path using the input you've provided.\n\nStarting from 'y', we see that 'y' has children 'z', 'wf', and 'ii'. We need to follow each branch until we find 'rj'. By searching through the list, we can see that node 'rj' is under node 'qj', which is under 'pj', which is under 'oj', which is under 'ii', which is under 'y'. So, we can now construct the path:\n\ny -> ii -> oj -> pj -> qj -> rj\n\nIf you would like this in the same format as your example (A->D->H), it would look like this:\n\ny->ii->oj->pj->qj->rj\n\nThis is the path from root node 'y' to node 'rj' based on the input provided."
