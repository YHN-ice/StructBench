Identifying the Root Node: The root node is the starting point of any path in a tree. The parser must correctly identify this node from the file.\n\n3. Traversing the Tree: To find the path to a specific node, the parser must traverse the tree, which could be done using techniques such as breadth-first search or depth-first search.
