        "The input provided is a series of directed edges connecting nodes in a graph. To find the path from the root node to node 'dj', we need to understand the structure of this graph and identify the root node. Since no specific root node is mentioned, we must make an assumption about the root based on the provided edges.\n\nTypically, in a tree, the root node is the one that has no incoming edges, only outgoing edges. From the input given, it's not possible to directly infer the root, as we only have a subset of the tree. However, since each child appears to have only one parent and we're looking for a path to 'dj', we can work in reverse from 'dj' up through its ancestors until we reach a node that does not have a parent listed, which we will assume to be the root.\n\nLet's construct the reverse path starting from 'dj':\n\n1.
