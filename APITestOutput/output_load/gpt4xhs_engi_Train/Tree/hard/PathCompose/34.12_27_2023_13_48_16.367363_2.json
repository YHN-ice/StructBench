Understanding how the tree is represented is necessary to trace the path.\n\n3. **Node Identification:** Nodes may not be uniquely identifiable if there are no unique names or identifiers assigned to them. This can make it difficult to distinguish between different nodes with the same name or label.\n\n4. **Error Handling:** The file might contain errors, such as missing nodes, incorrect indentations, or broken parent-child relationships.
