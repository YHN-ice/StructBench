The parser must be able to recognize and handle the specific format of the input file.\n\n2. **Tree Structure**: Trees can be represented in different ways, such as binary trees, n-ary trees, or even as graphs if there are reticulations. The parser must understand the structure to navigate it properly.\n\n3. **Node Identification**: Nodes may be identified by different attributes like names, ids, or labels.

The parser should be robust enough to handle or report these issues.\n\n5. **Complex Paths**: There may be multiple paths to a node if the tree is not strictly a hierarchy (e.g., in the case of phylogenetic networks).
