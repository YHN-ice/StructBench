In this case, additional information would be needed to determine which path is desired.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: Handling of errors or malformed data within the tree file must be considered to avoid crashing or returning incorrect information.\n\nOnce I have access to the actual input file and its structure, I can provide an accurate path from the root to node 'fb'."
