        "To find the path from the root node to the node `sc`, we need to traverse the tree structure described by the given relationships. We can construct the tree and then backtrack from the node `sc` to the root node.\n\nFrom the input data, we see that each line describes a parent-child relationship in the format `parent->child`. We can use this to build a map of child-to-parent relationships, which will allow us to find the path by starting from `sc` and moving up towards the root.\n\nLet's construct this map and then determine the path:\n\n1. First, we build a map where each key is a child node, and its value is the parent node. We need only track the parents of nodes since we are provided with directed edges (implicit tree structure).\n   \n2.
