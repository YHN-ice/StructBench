        "To find the path from the root node to the node 'q', you need to traverse the input and build a tree or parent-child relationship map.

However, based on the given input snippet and assuming 'p' is your root node (since it isn't a child of any other node in the snippet provided), you can't build a valid path because there is no direct line of ancestors from 'q' to 'p'. There may be missing pairs in your input, or possibly 'p' is not the correct root.
