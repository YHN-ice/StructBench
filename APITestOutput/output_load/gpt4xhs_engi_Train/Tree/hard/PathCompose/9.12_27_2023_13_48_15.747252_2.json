        "To determine the path from the root node to node 'bf', we need to construct the tree based on the given relationships between nodes and then traverse it to find the desired path. Here's a step-wise method to achieve this without needing the actual tree file:\n\n1. Create a data structure to represent the tree, such as a dictionary to store parent-child relationships.\n2. Parse the given node relationships and populate the data structure. Each relationship defines a parent-child link (e.g., `s->t` means `s` is the parent of `t`).\n3. Once the tree structure is built, start from node 'bf' and trace the path up to the root node by finding each node's parent until you reach the root (which has no parent).\n4. Record the path found in reverse (from 'bf' up to the root) and then reverse it again to present it from root to 'bf'.\n\nLet's apply this method using the given relationships, focusing on finding the path to node 'bf':\n\nWe initialize our data structure (a dictionary) to keep track of each node's parent:\n```python\nparent_dict = {}\n```\nNext, we process each line of input (each relationship), populating the dictionary:\n```python\nrelationships = [\n    \"s->t\",\n    \"t->u\",\n    \"u->v\",\n    # ...

(any remaining relationships)\n]\n\nfor relationship in relationships:\n    parent, child = relationship.split(\"->\")\n    parent_dict[child] = parent\n```\nNow, we have a dictionary that maps each child to its parent. Starting from 'bf', we can find its ancestors:\n```python\nnode = 'bf'\npath = []\nwhile node in parent_dict:  # Continue until we reach the root that has no parent\n    path.append(node)\n    node = parent_dict[node]  # Move up to the parent\npath.append(node)  # Add the root node\n\n# Reverse the path to get it from root to 'bf'\npath = path[::-1]\n```\nFormat the path in the desired output format (e.g., A->B->C):\n```python\nformatted_path = \"->\".join(path)\nprint(formatted_path)\n```\nAfter running this code with all your relationships included, you'll get an output string representing the path from the root ('s') to 'bf'.
