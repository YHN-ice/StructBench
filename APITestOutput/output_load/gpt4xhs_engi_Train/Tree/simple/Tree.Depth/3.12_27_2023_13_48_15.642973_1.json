If the format is not standard or if it's poorly structured, it might complicate the parsing process.\n   \n2. Node Identification: Nodes might not be uniquely identified or labeled, which could make it difficult to locate the specific node 'mc'. \n\n3. Tree Structure: The tree could be unbalanced or non-binary, which means a simple recursive traversal algorithm might need some adaptation to ensure all nodes are visited and their depths correctly calculated.\n\n4. Large Size: If the tree is very large, it might take a significant amount of time or memory to parse and process it.\n\n5.
