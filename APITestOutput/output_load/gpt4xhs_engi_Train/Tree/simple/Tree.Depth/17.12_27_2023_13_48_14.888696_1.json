It might be in a nested format, adjacency list, or another representation, and each format requires a different parsing approach.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The file might contain errors or inconsistencies, such as missing nodes, incorrect indentation, or broken hierarchy, which would make it difficult to accurately determine the depth of a node.\n\n5. **Large Tree Size**: If the tree is very large, it might not be practical to manually traverse it to find the depth of a node. Efficient algorithms and possibly some form of memoization or caching might be necessary to handle large trees.\n\n6. **Ambiguous Node Identifiers**: If nodes are not uniquely identified (e.g., if there are multiple nodes with the same name), disambiguating which node's depth is being asked for could be challenging.\n\n7. **Recursive Structures**: If the tree contains recursive structures or cyclical references, special care must be taken to avoid infinite loops and correctly compute depths.\n\nOnce I have the actual Tree file content, I'll be able to address these challenges and determine the depth of node 'cc'."
