If there are multiple nodes with the same identifier or if the identifier \"jd\" is not unique, it could be difficult to determine which node's depth is being asked for.\n\n4. **Depth Definition**: The definition of depth must be clear. Depth is usually defined as the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node. However, if the root node of \"jd\" is ambiguous or if there are multiple paths leading to \"jd\", determining its depth could be problematic.\n\n5. **Large or Circular Trees**: If the tree is very large, it may be resource-intensive to parse it completely to find the depth of a single node.
