        "Based on the tree structure you provided, we can determine the height of the root node by finding the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. The height is defined as the number of edges in this path.\n\nFrom the structure you have provided, let's visualize it as a tree:\n\n```\n             u\n      /     |       |    \\   \n    v      qb      lc    gd\n   /|\\     /|\\      /|\\    /|\\\n  w bb gb rb lc   mc rc  hd md rd wd\n / ...  ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ...\n```\n\nWe can see that the tree starts from the root node 'u', and then branches out. Since the height is given by the longest path of edges from 'u' to any leaf node, we can follow each branch down from 'u' and count the edges.\n\nFor instance, the path `u->v->w->x` has 3 edges. However, we need to find the longest such path. By scanning through your input, it seems that all paths are of similar length (e.g., `u->v->w->...`, `u->qb->rb->...`, `u->lc->mc->...`, and `u->gd->hd->...`), with each non-leaf node having four child nodes except for 'u' which has four child nodes. \n\nTherefore, each branch has a maximum depth of 3 (from 'u' to the fourth level down). Since we are looking for the height, which is essentially the maximum depth, and seeing that all branches seem to extend uniformly, the height of the root node 'u' is 3 edges.\n\nAnswer: 3"
