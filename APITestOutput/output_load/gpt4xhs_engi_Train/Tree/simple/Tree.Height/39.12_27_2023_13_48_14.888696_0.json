        "The input provided outlines a tree structure with nodes and edges represented by lines in the format `parent->child`.

The root node in this input appears to be `u`, as it is at the beginning and has no parent nodes pointing to it.\n\nTo calculate the height, we can trace each path from `u` downwards, counting the number of edges until we reach a leaf node (a node without any children).
