        "Based on the input you've provided, it is a representation of a tree structure with nodes and their children. To determine the height of the root node, we need to find the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. In this case, the root node is 'k', and we need to find the depth of the deepest leaf node.\n\nThe input shows that 'k' is connected to 'l', 'gb', 'bc', 'wc', each of which has its own subtree. We can find the height by recursively traversing each subtree from 'k' and keeping track of the maximum depth encountered.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process to find the height:\n\n- Start at the root node 'k'.\n- Traverse each child of 'k' (which are 'l', 'gb', 'bc', and 'wc') and calculate their respective heights.\n- The height of each child is 1 + the maximum height of its children.\n- Return the maximum height found among all children of 'k'.\n\nBy looking at the data and following the edges, we can visually determine the height by finding the longest path. Let's take a look at one of the deepest paths:\n\nk -> l -> m -> n\n\nThis path has 3 edges. However, without evaluating every single path manually, we cannot be certain this is the deepest. Therefore, we would typically use an algorithm to ensure we've found the correct maximum depth.\n\nIf we were to implement this in code (e.g., using Python), we could do something like this:\n\n```python\ntree = {\n    'k': ['l', 'gb', 'bc', 'wc'],\n    'l': ['m', 'r', 'w', 'bb'],\n    # ...

As mentioned before, without checking all paths, we can't be certain of the deepest path, but it appears that there are no paths deeper than 3 edges.
