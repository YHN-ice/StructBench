        "To determine the height of the root node without an actual parser, we can manually track the longest path from the root node to any leaf node by following the edges in the tree structure provided in the input.\n\nIn your input, 'w' is the root node.

We have to follow each path to see which one leads to the longest path.\n- Following the path from w to x, we see that x branches further to y, db, ib, and nb.\n- Continuing from x to y, we see that y has several leaf nodes (z, ab, bb, cb), but they only add one more edge to the path.\n- Going back to x and now following to db, db has leaf nodes too (eb, fb, gb, hb), again adding only one more edge to the path.\n- Continuing with x to ib, ib leads to leaf nodes (jb, kb, lb, mb), again adding only one edge.\n- With x to nb, nb also leads to leaf nodes (ob, pb, qb, rb), with one additional edge.\n- Now let's check another branch starting from w.
