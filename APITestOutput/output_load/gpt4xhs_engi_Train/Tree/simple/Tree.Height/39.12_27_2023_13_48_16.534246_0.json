        "Given the input, which represents the edges of a tree structure, we can construct the tree and calculate the height of the root node. The input format is such that the first node mentioned is the parent and the node after the arrow \"->\" is the child.\n\nWe do not need to construct an actual tree data structure to determine the height; instead, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to track the maximum depth as we traverse from the root.\n\nThe tree described in the input is a directed tree with the root node labeled 't'.
