        "To find the height of the root node in a tree structure described by edge relationships, we can create a representation of the tree and apply an algorithm to calculate its height. In this case, the input describes a tree with nodes and their child nodes. We do not have a specific file format, but the representation is given directly as edges between nodes (parent->child).\n\nBased on the input, we can build a tree and then calculate its height. The height of the root node is the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.\n\nHere's how you could approach this problem:\n\n1. Parse the input to build the tree structure.\n2. Traverse the tree to calculate its height, starting from the root node.\n\nGiven that the root node in your input is 'q', the edges you provided suggest that 'q' is the starting point for our tree traversal. We can apply a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the longest path in the tree, which corresponds to its height.\n\nI will now outline a pseudo code to calculate the height of such a tree:\n\n```\ndef find_height(node):\n    if node has no children:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Recursively find the height of each child and return the maximum height\n        return 1 + max(find_height(child) for child in children[node])\n\n# Parse the input to build a tree structure\ntree_input = [\n    \"q->r\", \"r->s\", \"s->t\", \"s->u\", \"s->v\", ..., \"sd->vd\", \"sd->wd\"\n]\nchildren = {}\n\n# Construct the tree\nfor edge in tree_input:\n    parent, child = edge.split(\"->\")\n    if parent not in children:\n        children[parent] = []\n    children[parent].append(child)\n\n# Calculating the root's height\nroot_height = find_height('q')\n```\n\nIn this pseudo code, `children` is a dictionary that maps each node to its list of child nodes. The `find_height` function recursively calculates the height of a node by finding the height of each of its children and selecting the maximum value. Since leaves have a height of 0 by definition, we add one for each level of recursion to get the total height.\n\nBased on your input and assuming there are no cycles or errors in your tree, running this algorithm will give you an integer value representing the height of the root node 'q'."
