        "Given the input describing the tree structure, we can construct the tree and calculate the height of the root node. The height of a node in a tree is the number of edges in the longest path from that node to any leaf. Since leaf nodes are at height 0, we will increment the height for each level we move up the tree.\n\nThe provided tree structure appears to be a directed tree with `o` as the root node. To find the height of the root node, we need to find the longest path from `o` to any leaf node. Based on the input, we can see that each lettered node (e.g., `o`, `p`, `q`, etc.) corresponds to a parent node, and each arrow (`->`) points to a child node.\n\nTo calculate the height, we increment by 1 for each level we go down from the root. From the `o` root node, there are several branches, and we want to find the one with the most levels. From a quick inspection of your provided data, it seems that each subsequent child node only has one more level down, no matter which branch you look at. Thus, we have a straightforward way to determine the height of the root node: just count the levels down one of the longest branches.\n\nOne of the longest branches appears to be:\n`o -> p -> q -> r`\n\nThis branch contains 3 edges from the root node `o` to the leaf node `r`. Therefore, the height of the root node is **3**."
