Here, manually inspecting the tree structure:\n\n- The longest path from 'f' could be through 'g': f->g->m->n (or another leaf under 'm'), which has 3 edges.\n- The paths from 'f' through its other children ('bb', 'wb', 'rc', 'hd') are not longer than the path through 'g', as they all have similar structures with three edges maximum from 'f' to any leaf.\n\nThus, the height of the root node 'f', which is the number of edges in the longest path from 'f' to any leaf node, is 3.\n\nAnswer: 3"
