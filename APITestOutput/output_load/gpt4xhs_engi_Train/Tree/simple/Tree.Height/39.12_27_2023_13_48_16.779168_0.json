For simplicity, we can represent the tree as a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of its children.\n2.

Define a recursive function `calculate_height(node, current_height)` that:\n   - Checks if `node` has children:\n     - If not, it's a leaf node, so update `max_height` with `current_height` if this is the largest encountered so far.\n     - Otherwise, for each child of `node`, call `calculate_height(child, current_height + 1)`.\n4.
