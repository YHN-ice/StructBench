This could involve creating objects for each node and establishing parent-child links.\n\n5. **Navigating the Tree:** Once the tree is built, you need to implement traversal logic to navigate from the root to any given node, which can be non-trivial depending on the tree's structure (e.g., binary tree, n-ary tree, etc.).\n\n6. **Error Handling:** The parser should gracefully handle errors in the file, such as malformed lines or an undefined path to a particular node.\n\n7. **Performance:** If the tree is very large, the parser and search algorithm must be efficient enough to quickly return the requested path.\n\n8. **Output Formatting:** Finally, the parser must output the path in the specified format (e.g., A->D->H), which involves correctly concatenating node names with appropriate separators.\n\nPlease provide the input file or further details about the tree structure so that I can assist you with your question."
