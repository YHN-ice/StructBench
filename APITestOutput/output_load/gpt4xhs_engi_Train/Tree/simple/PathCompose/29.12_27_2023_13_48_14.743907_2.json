Multiple Paths: If the tree can have multiple instances of a node (with the same name but different instances), determining which path to take might be challenging.\n\n5. Missing Nodes: If there are missing or undefined nodes in the file, it could lead to dead ends or make it impossible to find the path without making assumptions or corrections.\n\n6. Cycles: Ideally, a tree structure should not contain cycles. If the file mistakenly contains cycles, it may cause infinite loops during traversal.\n\n7.
