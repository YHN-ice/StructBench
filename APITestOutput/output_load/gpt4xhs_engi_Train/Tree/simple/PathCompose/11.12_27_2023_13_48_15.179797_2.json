Navigating through these structures to find a specific path can be challenging.\n\n3. **Non-Unique Identifiers**: If the nodes within the tree are not uniquely identified or if the target node (\"vb\") has duplicates within the tree, it may be difficult to determine which path is being requested.\n\n4. **Ambiguous Path Definitions**: Depending on the tree's structure, there might be multiple paths leading to the same node due to the presence of cycles or re-merging branches.
