If the format is not standardized or is poorly formatted, it could be challenging to extract the necessary information.\n\n2. **Size and Complexity**: If the tree is very large or deeply nested, it may be difficult to efficiently traverse the tree to find the correct path. Performance issues could arise with very large trees.\n\n3. **Non-unique Identifiers**: If node identifiers (like \"eb\") are not unique within the tree, it could be ambiguous which path to provide.
