Ambiguities in Node Names: If node names are not unique or if there are ambiguities in node identifiers, it may be challenging to determine the correct path to a given node.\n\n4. Error Handling: The file might contain errors or inconsistencies that need to be handled gracefully. For example, missing nodes, incorrect links, or cycles that are not expected in a tree structure could complicate the parsing process.\n\n5. Large File Size: If the Tree file is very large, it may present performance issues and require efficient parsing algorithms to handle data without excessive resource consumption.\n\n6. Nested Structures: The path parsing logic must be able to handle nested structures properly and maintain the state as it traverses the tree.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, I would need to see the input Tree file and ensure that none of these obstacles are present or that they are handled appropriately during the parsing process."
