If a comma is missing, it is a structural error.\n\n2. **Trailing Commas**: While some programming languages or parsers may allow trailing commas, JSON does not permit a comma at the end of a list of elements or object members.\n\n3. **Unquoted Keys**: JSON requires that keys in objects are strings wrapped in double quotes. If the keys are not quoted or use single quotes, it is an error.\n\n4. **Incorrect Quotes**: JSON strings must be enclosed in double quotes. Using single quotes or no quotes at all for strings is an error.\n\n5. **Mismatched Brackets and Braces**: Every opened curly brace `{` must have a closing curly brace `}`, and every opened square bracket `[` must have a closing square bracket `]`. A mismatch is an error.\n\n6. **Data Types**: JSON has specific data types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null). Errors can occur if these types are not respected, such as wrapping numbers in quotes or not using lowercase for booleans.\n\n7. **Nested Objects/Arrays**: Proper nesting is crucial. Errors can occur if objects or arrays are not properly enclosed within other objects or arrays.\n\n8. **Extra Characters**: Any characters outside of the JSON structure (before an opening brace or after a closing brace) are errors.\n\n9. **Encoding Problems**: Non-UTF-8 encoded content or special characters not properly escaped can cause errors.\n\nPlease provide the JSON file content so I can proceed with checking for any structural errors."
