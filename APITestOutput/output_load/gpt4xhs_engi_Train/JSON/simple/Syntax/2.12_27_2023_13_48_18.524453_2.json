Mismatched braces or brackets: Every opening brace `{` or bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing brace `}` or bracket `]`. Any mismatch can result in a structural error.\n\n3. Improper quotation marks: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes `\"`. Single quotes `'` are not valid for enclosing keys or string values.\n\n4. Data type errors: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. A common mistake is to include an unsupported data type or to format a value incorrectly.\n\n5. Unescaped special characters: Special characters in strings (like double quotes, backslashes, etc.) need to be escaped with a backslash (`\\`).\n\n6.
