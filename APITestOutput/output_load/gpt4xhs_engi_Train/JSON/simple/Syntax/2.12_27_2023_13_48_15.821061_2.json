Single quotes are not valid for enclosing keys or string values.\n\n3. **Unquoted keys:** All keys in a JSON object must be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n4. **Trailing commas:** Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in arrays or objects, JSON does not permit trailing commas after the last element.\n\n5. **Data types mismatch:** Values must be of an appropriate data type (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). For example, strings must be in quotes, and booleans should not.\n\n6. **Braces and brackets mismatch:** Opening and closing braces `{}` (for objects) and brackets `[]` (for arrays) must be correctly paired and nested.\n\n7. **Syntax errors:** Any other syntactic errors such as missing colons between keys and values or incorrectly nested elements.\n\nIf any of these errors are present, the JSON will be considered structurally incorrect.
