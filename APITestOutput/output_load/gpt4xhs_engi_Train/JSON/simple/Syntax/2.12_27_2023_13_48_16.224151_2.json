Arrays should be enclosed in `[` and `]`. Mismatched or missing brackets/braces can cause errors.\n\n2. **Comma Errors**: Extra or missing commas can lead to issues. Every element in an array or object should be followed by a comma, except for the last one.\n\n3. **Key-Value Pair Issues**: Every key should be a string wrapped in double quotes, and key-value pairs should be separated by a colon.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings (in double quotes), numbers, objects, arrays, `true`, `false`, and `null`. Incorrect data types or invalid syntax can cause errors.\n\n5. **Quotation Marks**: JSON keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid.\n\n6. **Encoding Problems**: JSON must be encoded in UTF-8, and any problems with character encoding can result in errors when parsing.\n\n7. **Nested Structures**: Deeply nested structures can sometimes be confusing and prone to mistakes, like missing closing brackets for nested objects or arrays.\n\n8. **Trailing Characters**: Any characters after the closing `}` of the JSON object can result in an error.\n\n9. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, so any presence of comments would cause an error.\n\nAfter receiving the JSON input, the process would involve methodically checking for all the above issues to determine if there is a structural error or not."
