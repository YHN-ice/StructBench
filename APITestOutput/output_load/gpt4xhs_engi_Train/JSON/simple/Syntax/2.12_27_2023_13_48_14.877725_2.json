If a value is not correctly formatted according to its data type, it'll be an error.\n3. **Nested Structures**: Complex JSON objects with nested arrays and objects can be tricky to navigate and it's easy to lose track of the hierarchical structure.\n4. **Encoding Issues**: JSON data must be in UTF-8 encoding; if not, there may be problems in reading and interpreting the file.\n5. **Large Files**: Very large JSON files can be difficult to parse due to memory constraints or performance issues.\n6. **Duplicated Keys**: While technically not an error in JSON, duplicated keys within an object can lead to unexpected behavior since most parsers will only consider the last value associated with a given key.\n7. **Trailing Commas**: Trailing commas are not allowed in JSON and will result in a parsing error.\n\nIn order to determine if there is a structural error in the provided JSON file, these are some of the key aspects that need to be checked."
