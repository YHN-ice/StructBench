A common error is the misuse or imbalance of these brackets.\n\n2. **Missing Commas or Extra Commas**: Each key-value pair in a JSON object and each element in an array must be separated by a comma. Missing commas can cause parsing to fail, as can extra commas, especially after the last element in an object or array.\n\n3. **Unquoted or Improperly Quoted Strings**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and unquoted strings will lead to errors.\n\n4. **Data Types Issues**: JSON has specific data types, such as number, string, boolean, object, array, and null. Sometimes, values may be assigned an incorrect type, like a string instead of a number.\n\n5. **Trailing Characters**: Anything outside of the root object or array is considered a trailing character and will cause an error.\n\n6. **Nesting Errors**: Overly complex or improperly nested objects and arrays can be difficult to parse and may lead to errors if not structured correctly.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains characters that are not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), it can result in parsing errors.\n\nOnce I see the input JSON file, I will analyze it for these common structural issues to determine if there are any errors."
