Common issues include:\n\n1. **Misplaced or missing brackets and braces**: JSON structure relies on curly braces `{}` to encapsulate objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays. Any mismatch or incorrect placement can cause an error.\n\n2. **Improper use of commas**: Commas are used to separate key-value pairs within an object and elements within an array. A missing comma can lead to an error, as can an extra comma, especially if it's at the end of a list of key-value pairs or array elements (although some parsers may allow trailing commas).\n\n3. **Unquoted or poorly quoted strings**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes `\"`. Single quotes `'` are not valid, and missing quotes will also lead to an error.\n\n4. **Data type issues**: JSON expects data to be in certain formats, like strings in double quotes, numbers without quotes, and the use of boolean values `true` or `false` without quotes.\n\n5. **Colon between key and value**: Each key-value pair must be separated by a colon `:`. A missing or misplaced colon can cause an error.\n\n6. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments. Including them would result in an error.\n\n7. **Encoding issues**: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8, but sometimes files are saved with different encodings which might lead to parsing errors.\n\nOnce I see the JSON input, I'll be able to determine if any of these common issues are present and whether the file contains structural errors."
