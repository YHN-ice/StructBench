Missing or extra commas: JSON relies on commas to separate elements in arrays and key-value pairs in objects. A missing or extra comma can lead to an invalid JSON structure.\n\n2. Unquoted keys: JSON requires all keys in objects to be enclosed in double quotes. Unquoted keys can invalidate the JSON structure.\n\n3. Incorrect bracket pairing: Objects are enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Mismatched or improperly nested brackets can cause structural errors.\n\n4. Trailing commas: Although some parsers may allow it, officially, a trailing comma after the last element in an array or the last key-value pair in an object is not allowed in JSON.\n\n5. Data type issues: JSON has specific data types such as string, number, object, array, boolean, and null. Incorrect usage of data types (like using a single quote for strings) can lead to errors.\n\n6. Encoding problems: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8, and issues with encoding can result in errors when parsing the file.\n\n7.
