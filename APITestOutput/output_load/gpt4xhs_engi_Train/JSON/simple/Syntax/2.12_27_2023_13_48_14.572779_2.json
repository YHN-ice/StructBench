Single quotes are not valid.\n\n2. **Trailing Commas**: JSON does not allow a trailing comma at the end of lists or objects.\n\n3. **Missing Commas**: Commas must separate elements in arrays and members in objects.\n\n4. **Unescaped Characters**: Special characters in strings must be escaped with a backslash, such as `\\\"`, `\\\\`, `\\b`, `\\n`, `\\r`, `\\t`, `\\f`, etc.\n\n5. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Errors can be made if the wrong data type is used.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: Any deviation from the correct syntax such as missing brackets or braces, or incorrectly nested objects or arrays.\n\n7. **Extra/Unexpected Tokens**: Including any characters or tokens that are not part of the JSON structure.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the file encoding is not UTF-8, some characters may not be represented correctly.\n\n9. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, so any presence of them is an error.\n\n10. **Duplicate Keys**: Objects should not have duplicate keys; each key within an object should be unique.\n\nIdentifying these potential issues requires a careful examination of the JSON structure according to the JSON format specification.
