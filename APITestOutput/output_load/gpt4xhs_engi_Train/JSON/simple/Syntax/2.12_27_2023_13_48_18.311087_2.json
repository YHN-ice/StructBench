Missing or extra commas: JSON objects and arrays use commas to separate elements. A missing comma can cause elements to be improperly parsed, while an extra comma can lead to unexpected tokens.\n\n2. Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and string values: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and unquoted strings can cause parsing errors.\n\n3. Incorrect brace usage: JSON objects are enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Misplaced or unmatched braces can invalidate the structure.\n\n4. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types (string, number, object, array, boolean, and null). Assigning invalid data types to these elements will cause errors.\n\n5. Trailing commas: Although some parsers tolerate trailing commas, standard JSON does not allow a comma after the last element in an object or array.\n\n6. Encoding problems: JSON is typically encoded in UTF-8; if it's not, it could cause issues when parsing special characters.\n\n7. Nesting errors: Improperly nested objects or arrays can also lead to structural problems.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the JSON file, I would identify that there is a structural error.
