If a value is assigned an incorrect data type, this could lead to an error.\n\n3. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text must be encoded in Unicode (like UTF-8), and if it's not, this could cause issues when parsing the file.\n\n4. **Nested Objects/Arrays**: Highly nested objects or arrays can be complex to parse and small mistakes in nesting can lead to structural errors.\n\n5. **Unescaped Characters**: Certain characters must be escaped in JSON strings (like backslashes and quotation marks within strings). Unescaped characters might cause parsing errors.\n\n6. **Key Duplication**: Having duplicate keys within an object might not necessarily be a syntax error in JSON, but it can lead to unexpected behavior as typically only one of the values associated with the duplicate key will be used.\n\n7. **Comments**: JSON does not natively support comments. While some parsers might handle them gracefully, standard JSON parsers will treat comments as errors.\n\n8. **Trailing Commas**: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in lists and objects, in JSON, this is considered an error.\n\nIt is important to review the JSON file carefully to identify if any of these potential issues are present. If you provide the JSON file, I can proceed to check for structural errors."
