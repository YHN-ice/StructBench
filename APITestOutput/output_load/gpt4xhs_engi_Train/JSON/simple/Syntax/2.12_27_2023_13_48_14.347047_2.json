Here is a list of potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Syntax Errors**: JSON format is very strict. Common syntax errors include:\n   - Missing or extra commas.\n   - Missing quotation marks around keys or string values.\n   - Using single quotes instead of double quotes.\n   - Trailing commas after the last element in an array or object.\n   - Unnecessary leading zeros in numbers or incorrect number formats.\n\n2. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Any deviation from these expected data types can cause parsing errors.\n\n3. **Nesting and Hierarchies**: JSON objects and arrays can be nested within each other. Errors in the way elements are nested can lead to a breakdown in the structure.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text must be properly encoded as UTF-8. If the encoding is not correct, it can result in parsing failures.\n\n5. **Large File Sizes**: Very large JSON files can be difficult to parse due to memory limitations or performance issues.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the JSON file you provide, they could hinder the process of parsing and interpreting the data accurately.
