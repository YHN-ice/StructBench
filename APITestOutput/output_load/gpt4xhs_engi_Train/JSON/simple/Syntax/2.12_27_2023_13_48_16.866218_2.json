Common mistakes include missing or extra commas, unquoted keys, single quotes around strings instead of double quotes, trailing commas, etc.\n\n2. **Data type issues**: Values must be of a valid JSON data type: string, number, object, array, true, false, or null.\n\n3. **Nesting problems**: Objects and arrays can be nested in JSON. Incorrect nesting can lead to structural errors.\n\n4. **Unexpected characters**: Any character that's not part of the JSON format (like JavaScript comments, which are not allowed in JSON) will result in an error.\n\n5. **Encoding issues**: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8, and issues can arise if it's not.\n\n6. **Mismatched or unbalanced delimiters**: Delimiters like curly braces `{}` and square brackets `[]` must be properly opened and closed in pairs.\n\n7. **Incomplete JSON structure**: The file might not contain a complete JSON structure, meaning it cuts off prematurely.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, I would need to see the actual JSON input file to check for these types of errors.
