Each opening bracket should have a corresponding closing bracket.\n3. **Unquoted keys**: In JSON, keys must be strings and thus should be enclosed in double quotes.\n4. **Improperly formatted strings**: String values must be enclosed in double quotes.\n5. **Trailing commas**: JSON does not allow a trailing comma after the last element in an array or the last key-value pair in an object.\n6. **Data type issues**: Values must be of an appropriate data type (e.g., strings in quotes, numbers without quotes, etc.).\n7. **Incorrect escaping**: Special characters in strings (like double quotes or backslashes) must be escaped with a backslash.\n8. **Colon usage**: Each key-value pair must have a colon separating the key from the value.\n\nAny of these issues could prevent the JSON from being properly parsed and are considered structural errors.
