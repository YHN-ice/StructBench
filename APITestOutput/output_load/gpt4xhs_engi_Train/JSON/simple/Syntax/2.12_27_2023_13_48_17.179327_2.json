Single quotes are not valid for enclosing keys or string values.\n\n4. **Trailing commas:** Unlike some programming languages, JSON does not allow a trailing comma after the last element in an array or the last key-value pair in an object.\n\n5. **Mismatched brackets or braces:** An array is enclosed in square brackets `[]` and an object is enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Every opening bracket or brace must have a corresponding closing bracket or brace.\n\n6. **Incorrect data types:** JSON has specific data types such as number, string, boolean, array, object, and null. Values must be of a valid type.\n\n7. **Nested errors:** JSON can contain nested arrays and objects, and errors can occur at any level of nesting.\n\n8. **Invalid characters:** Special characters in strings need to be escaped using a backslash `\\`.\n\nIf I come across any of these issues while parsing the given JSON, it will prevent successful parsing and indicate that there is a structural error in the JSON file.
