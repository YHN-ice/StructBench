Missing or extra commas: Every key-value pair in an object should be separated by a comma, except for the last pair. Similarly, elements in an array should be separated by commas, except for the last element.\n\n2. Unquoted keys or strings: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Extraneous trailing commas: Having a comma after the last key-value pair in an object or the last element in an array is an error.\n\n4. Mismatched or missing brackets and braces: Every opening curly brace `{` must have a corresponding closing curly brace `}`, and every opening square bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing square bracket `]`. \n\n5. Incorrect data types: JSON has specific data types, such as numbers, strings, boolean, null, arrays, and objects. Inserting a different data type where one of these is expected can cause an error.\n\n6. Improper nesting: The structure of nested objects and arrays must be correct, ensuring that each level of nesting is properly encapsulated within its parent object or array.\n\n7.
