Single quotes are not valid, and keys must also be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n5. **Data Types**: JSON values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, `true`, `false`, or `null`. Ensuring that the data types are valid and correctly used is important.\n\n6. **Trailing Characters**: Additional characters after the final closing bracket can cause errors.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the file has encoding issues, such as characters that are not valid in the UTF-8 encoding, it could lead to parsing problems.\n\nThese are key aspects to look for when identifying structural errors in a JSON file.
