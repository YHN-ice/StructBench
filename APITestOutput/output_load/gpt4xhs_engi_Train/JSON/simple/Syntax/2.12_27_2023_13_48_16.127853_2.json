These should be properly opened and closed in pairs. Any mismatch here would be an error.\n\n3. **Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and string values**: In JSON, keys and string values should be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and keys/values without quotes are incorrect.\n\n4. **Data types**: Values in JSON must be of the correct data type. For instance, strings should be in quotes, numbers should not be quoted, and true/false values should be lowercase and not quoted.\n\n5. **Trailing commas**: A trailing comma after the last key-value pair in an object or after the last element in an array is invalid.\n\n6. **Nested structures**: Incorrectly nested arrays or objects can lead to structural errors.\n\n7. **Encoding issues**: The file should be properly encoded (usually UTF-8), and characters should be escaped where necessary.\n\n8. **Syntax errors**: Any deviation from the expected syntax, such as using an equals sign (`=`) instead of a colon (`:`) to separate keys from values, would be an error.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the given JSON file, it would be considered structurally incorrect.
