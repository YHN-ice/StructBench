A common mistake is using single quotes or no quotes at all.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Mistakes can occur when data types are not used correctly, such as enclosing a number in quotes or not using quotes for a string.\n\n5. **Braces and Brackets**: Objects are enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. An imbalance or incorrect use of these can lead to errors.\n\n6. **Colon Usage**: Inside JSON objects, a colon separates keys from their values. Omitting the colon or using an incorrect symbol can cause an error.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: Any deviation from the correct syntax such as typos, incorrect nesting, or faulty hierarchical structures.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: The file should be encoded in UTF-8 without any BOM (Byte Order Mark).\n\n9. **File Size**: A very large JSON file might exceed memory limits or cause performance issues which could hinder parsing.\n\nOnce we encounter the actual JSON input, these potential issues will guide the identification of any structural errors present in the file."
