Missing or extra commas: JSON requires commas between elements in an array and between key-value pairs in an object. A missing comma can cause a parsing error, while an extra comma (especially at the end of a list or object) may also lead to errors.\n\n2. Unquoted keys: In JSON, all keys in an object must be strings and thus should be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Single quotes: JSON only supports double quotes for strings. If a string is enclosed in single quotes, it is not valid JSON.\n\n4. Trailing commas: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an array or the last key-value pair in an object.\n\n5. Incorrect data types: JSON has specific data types (e.g., string, number, object, array, true, false, null). Assigning a value to a wrong data type can cause an error.\n\n6. Nesting errors: Improperly nested objects or arrays can break the structure of the JSON.\n\n7. Syntax errors: Any kind of typographical mistake (like missing brackets, braces, or misplaced quotation marks) can lead to a syntax error.\n\nNow you can present the JSON file for parsing and I'll check for any structural errors based on these potential issues."
