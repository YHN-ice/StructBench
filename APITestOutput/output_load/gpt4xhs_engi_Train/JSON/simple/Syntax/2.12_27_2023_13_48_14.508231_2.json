Here's a list of potential difficulties and obstacles one might encounter:\n\n1. **Missing or Extra Commas**: Each key-value pair in an object or each element in an array should be separated by a comma. Missing a comma can lead to parsing errors, while an extra comma (especially if it's trailing in an array or object) can also cause issues.\n\n2. **Unquoted or Improperly Quoted Keys and String Values**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and keys without quotes or with incorrect quotation marks will result in errors.\n\n3. **Invalid Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). If a value does not conform to these types, that can lead to errors.\n\n4. **Mismatched Brackets and Curly Braces**: Every opening bracket `[` or curly brace `{` needs to have a corresponding closing bracket `]` or curly brace `}`. Mismatching these can break the structure of the JSON.\n\n5. **Incorrect Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments. Including comments can invalidate the JSON.\n\n6. **Extra Characters Outside of the JSON Structure**: Any characters outside of the main JSON structure can cause parsing to fail.\n\n7. **Nested Errors**: Sometimes the error is not at the first level of the JSON but nested within an object or an array, making it more difficult to spot.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If a JSON file is not properly encoded (UTF-8 is standard), this could lead to problems when parsing special characters.\n\nTo accurately determine whether there's a structural error in a JSON file, one needs to carefully check it against these common issues.
