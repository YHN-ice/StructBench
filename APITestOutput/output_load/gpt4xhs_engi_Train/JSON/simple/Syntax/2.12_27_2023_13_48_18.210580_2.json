Missing or extra commas: Each key-value pair in an object or each value in an array should be separated by a comma, but there should not be a trailing comma after the last element.\n\n2. Unquoted keys: JSON keys must be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Single quotes around strings: JSON requires double quotes for strings, not single quotes.\n\n4. Improper nesting: Objects and arrays must be properly nested within each other.\n\n5. Unescaped characters: Certain characters in strings need to be escaped using a backslash, such as double quotes, backslashes, and control characters like newline (\\n).\n\n6. Data types mismatch: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null), and values must correspond to the appropriate type.\n\n7. Brackets not matching: Curly braces `{}` denote objects and square brackets `[]` denote arrays; they must be used in matching pairs.\n\n8. Syntax errors: Any deviations from the JSON format rules can cause syntax errors, such as missing quotes around strings or invalid use of colons and braces.\n\nIf any of these issues or other syntactical inconsistencies are present in the input file, I'll be able to spot them once I review the contents of the JSON file.
