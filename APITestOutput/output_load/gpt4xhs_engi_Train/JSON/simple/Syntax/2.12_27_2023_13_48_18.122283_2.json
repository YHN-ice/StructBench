All string values must also be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. **Trailing commas**: JSON does not allow a trailing comma at the end of lists or objects.\n\n4. **Mismatched or missing brackets and braces**: JSON structures must have matching opening and closing brackets ([]) for arrays and braces ({}) for objects.\n\n5. **Incorrect data types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null.
