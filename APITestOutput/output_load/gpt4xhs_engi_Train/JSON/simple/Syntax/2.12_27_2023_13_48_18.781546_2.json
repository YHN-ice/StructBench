A common error is an extra comma after the last element of an object or array, or a missing comma between elements.\n\n2. **Improper Quotation Marks:** In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes, no quotes, or improper use of quotes can cause errors.\n\n3. **Braces and Brackets Mismatch:** Every opening brace `{` must have a closing brace `}` and every opening bracket `[` must have a closing bracket `]`. Unmatched or incorrectly nested braces and brackets can lead to structural errors.\n\n4. **Data Types Mismatch:** JSON supports specific data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. A mismatch, like putting a string without quotes, can result in errors.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas:** While some parsers may tolerate trailing commas, they are considered illegal in the JSON standard.\n\n6. **Colon vs Equal Sign:** In JSON, key-value pairs are separated by a colon `:`. Sometimes, people mistakenly use an equal sign `=` which is incorrect.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues:** JSON is typically encoded in UTF-8. Encoding issues might not be visible at a glance but can cause parsing errors.\n\n8. **Comments:** Standard JSON does not support comments. Including comments in a JSON file will lead to errors in most parsers.\n\n9. **Duplicate Keys:** Although not technically a structural error according to the JSON specification, duplicate keys in an object can lead to unexpected behavior as some parsers might ignore or overwrite the value of the first occurrence with the second one.\n\n10. **Parsing Limits:** Some JSON parsers have limits on the size of the JSON they can parse or may run into issues with deeply nested structures.\n\nWhen given an actual JSON input, these potential issues would be checked to determine if there are any structural errors in the JSON file provided."
