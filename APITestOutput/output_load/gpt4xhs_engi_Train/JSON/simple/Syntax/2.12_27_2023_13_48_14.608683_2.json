Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket.\n\n3. **Improper use of quotes**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid.\n\n4. **Colon instead of comma or vice versa**: Each key-value pair in an object must be separated by a colon, and each pair must be separated from the next by a comma.\n\n5. **Data types issues**: JSON values can only be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null.
