Missing or extra commas can result in errors.\n\n3. **Mismatched or missing brackets/braces**: Every opened curly brace `{` or square bracket `[` must be properly closed with `}` or `]`, respectively. Mismatched or missing closing brackets/braces can lead to errors.\n\n4. **Unquoted or improperly quoted strings**: In JSON, keys and string values should be enclosed in double quotes `\"`.\n\n5. **Trailing commas**: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last key-value pair in an object or the last element in an array.\n\n6. **Data type issues**: JSON only supports certain data types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null).
