Similarly, each element in an array must be separated by a comma, except the last element.\n\n2. **Wrong quotes usage**: In JSON, only double quotes are valid for enclosing keys and string values. Single quotes or missing quotes can cause errors.\n\n3. **Invalid data types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Using an unsupported data type or formatting (like trailing decimals, dates, functions) can result in errors.\n\n4. **Brackets and braces mismatch**: Curly braces `{}` must be properly matched and nested to define objects, and square brackets `[]` must be used correctly to define arrays.\n\n5. **Colon instead of equals sign**: In JSON, key-value pairs must be separated by a colon `:` rather than an equals sign `=`.\n\n6. **Trailing zeros in numbers**: Numbers in JSON should not have trailing zeros unless they are part of the fractional part of a decimal number.\n\n7. **Unescaped characters**: Certain characters must be escaped in JSON strings, such as double quotes, backslashes, and control characters.\n\n8. **Improper nesting**: Objects or arrays nested within other objects or arrays must maintain proper syntax and nesting rules.\n\nWhen given the JSON file input, we should check for these potential structural errors to determine if the JSON is well-formed or if it contains any issues that would prevent it from being parsed correctly."
