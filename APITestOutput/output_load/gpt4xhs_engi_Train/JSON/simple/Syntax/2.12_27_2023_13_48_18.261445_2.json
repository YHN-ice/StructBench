It must start with either a single object (enclosed in {}) or an array (enclosed in []) and follow the correct syntax.\n\n2. **Key-Value Pairs**: JSON data is written as key-value pairs, with keys being strings and values being valid JSON data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, or null). Each key-value pair must be separated by a comma.\n\n3. **Data Types**: The values must be of the correct type. Incorrect data types or formats (e.g., strings not enclosed in double quotes or numbers with invalid format) would be considered errors.\n\n4. **String Enclosure**: In JSON, strings must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid string delimiters.\n\n5. **Comma Usage**: Extra commas or missing commas between elements can cause errors. There shouldn't be a comma after the last key-value pair in an object or the last value in an array.\n\n6. **Nested Objects/Arrays**: The structure must correctly represent nested objects and arrays, respecting the opening and closing of braces `{}` and brackets `[]`.\n\n7. **Special Characters**: Special characters within strings must be properly escaped using a backslash `\\`.\n\nOnce I've seen the input JSON file, I will check for these potential issues to determine if there is any structural error.
