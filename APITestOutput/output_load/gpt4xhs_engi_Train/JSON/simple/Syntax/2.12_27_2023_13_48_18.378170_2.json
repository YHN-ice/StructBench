A missing comma can lead to the joining of two separate elements, while an extra comma can create an empty element that is not valid.\n\n2. **Improper use of quotes**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Missing quotes, single quotes, or improperly closed quotes are common errors.\n\n3. **Braces and brackets mismatch**: Each opening brace `{` or bracket `[` must be paired with a closing brace `}` or bracket `]`. Unmatched or incorrectly nested braces and brackets can cause structural issues.\n\n4. **Data type issues**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Assigning the wrong data type to a value can cause errors.\n\n5. **Trailing commas**: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in arrays or objects, JSON does not permit this. A trailing comma after the last element in an array or object is considered an error.\n\n6. **Colon issues**: In JSON objects, each key-value pair must be separated by a colon. Missing or extra colons can create syntactical errors.\n\n7. **Syntax misalignment**: Any deviation from the standard syntax rules of JSON format would lead to an error. This includes incorrect capitalization (JSON is case-sensitive), missing elements, or additional characters that do not fit the JSON structure.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I will check for these issues to determine if there is any structural error."
