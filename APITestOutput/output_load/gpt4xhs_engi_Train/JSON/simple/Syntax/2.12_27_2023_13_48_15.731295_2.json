For example, strings might not be enclosed in quotes, or numbers might be enclosed in quotes when they should not be.\n3. **Nesting and Hierarchy Issues**: Objects or arrays may not be properly nested or closed, leading to a breakdown in the JSON structure.\n4. **Encoding Issues**: If the file has encoding problems, it may contain characters that are not correctly displayed or that break the JSON format.\n5. **Duplicate Keys**: Some parsers could have issues with duplicate keys within an object, which is not standard compliant.\n6. **Trailing Comma**: A common mistake is to leave a trailing comma at the end of a list of elements or key-value pairs.\n\nEach of these issues would prevent a JSON file from parsing correctly.
