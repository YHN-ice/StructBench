Errors can occur if these types are mismatched or used incorrectly.\n\n3. **Encoding Issues**: If the file uses an unsupported character encoding, it can lead to errors when parsing.\n\n4. **Nested Object/Array Complexity**: Deeply nested objects or arrays could make it difficult to spot errors at a glance.\n\n5. **Key-Value Pair Issues**: Sometimes keys are missing or duplicate keys are present, which is not valid in a JSON object.\n\n6. **Large File Size**: For very large JSON files, it would be difficult and time-consuming to manually inspect every part of the file for errors.\n\n7. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, so any presence of comments can cause an error.\n\n8. **Trailing Characters**: Extra characters after a complete JSON document can also cause errors.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles and accurately determine the presence of errors, it is crucial to carefully inspect the structure of the JSON file, paying close attention to the syntax, and ensuring that the key-value pairs, arrays, and objects are properly formatted according to JSON standards.
