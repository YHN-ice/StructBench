Missing or extra commas: JSON objects separate key-value pairs with commas, and arrays separate elements with commas. Missing or extra commas can cause a file to be invalid.\n\n2. Incorrect brackets: JSON uses curly brackets for objects and square brackets for arrays. Mismatched or incorrectly nested brackets can cause errors.\n\n3. Unquoted strings: Keys and string values in JSON must be enclosed in double quotes. If they are not quoted or use single quotes, it is an error.\n\n4. Trailing commas: While some languages allow trailing commas in their data structures, JSON does not permit a trailing comma after the last element in an object or array.\n\n5. Data type issues: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). If a value is not of a correct type (for example, a string not enclosed in quotes), it is an error.\n\n6. Encoding problems: If the JSON file contains characters that are not properly encoded (e.g., special characters outside of ASCII without proper escaping), it may lead to errors when parsing.\n\n7. Syntax errors: Any other deviations from the JSON format specification, such as using undefined syntax or incorrect value assignments, can also lead to errors.\n\nThese potential difficulties need to be checked against the JSON file in question to determine if it is free from structural errors or not. Now you can provide the JSON file for evaluation."
