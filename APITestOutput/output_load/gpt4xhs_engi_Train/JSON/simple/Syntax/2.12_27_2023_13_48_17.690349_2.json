Here's a list of potential issues that we might encounter when checking the structure of a JSON file:\n\n1. **Syntax Errors**: JSON format is very strict. Missed commas, extra commas, double quotes on keys and string values, colons between keys and values are all required. Brackets need to be properly opened and closed.\n\n2. **Data Type Errors**: Values must be of an appropriate data type (string, number, object, array, true/false, or null). Strings must be wrapped in double quotes.\n\n3. **Nesting Errors**: Objects or arrays can be nested within other objects or arrays, but they must be properly opened and closed without overlap.\n\n4. **Unescaped Characters**: Within strings, certain characters like quotes, backslashes, and control characters need to be escaped with a backslash.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: The JSON should be properly encoded (typically UTF-8).\n\n6. **Trailing Commas**: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in arrays or objects, JSON does not permit this.\n\n7. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments.\n\n8. **No leading zeros in numbers**: Numbers in JSON cannot have leading zeros.\n\n9. **Duplicate keys**: While some parsers might allow duplicate keys within an object, according to JSON standards, each key within an object must be unique.\n\nIf you provide me with the JSON input, I can analyze the text and let you know if there are any structural errors based on these common issues."
