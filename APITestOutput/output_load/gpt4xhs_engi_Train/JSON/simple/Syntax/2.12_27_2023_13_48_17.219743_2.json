Single quotes `'` are not valid.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: Trailing commas at the end of lists (arrays) or objects are not allowed in JSON.\n\n5. **Duplicate Keys**: JSON objects should not contain duplicate keys; each key within an object should be unique.\n\n6. **Incorrect Data Types**: Values in JSON must be of an acceptable data type (string, number, object, array, boolean, or null).
