Common mistakes include missing commas, colons, or quotes. If these elements are not used correctly, it could lead to a structural error.\n\n2. **Data Types Issues**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Mistakes in data types, like wrapping a number in quotes or not correctly using brackets for arrays, could result in errors.\n\n3. **Nesting Problems**: Objects and arrays can be nested within each other. Errors can occur if nesting is done incorrectly, such as missing braces or square brackets to close nested structures.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: Having a comma after the last key-value pair in an object or the last element in an array is not allowed in JSON and would be considered a structural error.\n\n5. **Unescaped Characters**: Within strings, certain characters like quotes or backslashes must be escaped with a backslash (\\). If they are not, this could cause a structural error.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text shall be encoded in UTF-8. If the file contains characters that are not properly encoded, it may not be parsed correctly.\n\n7. **File Size Limitations**: If the JSON file is particularly large, there might be performance issues that could potentially interfere with the parsing process.\n\n8. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments. If the file includes comments, it will result in an error.\n\nNow that we've outlined some potential issues, please provide the JSON file content or structure so I can check for any structural errors."
