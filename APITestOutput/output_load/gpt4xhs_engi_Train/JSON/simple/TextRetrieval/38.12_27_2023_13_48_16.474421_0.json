The process might require more memory and time to process, and it might be difficult to locate the desired data quickly.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports various data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring correct handling and interpretation of these types is important when extracting data.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: If the JSON file contains syntax errors, it might not be possible to parse it correctly without first fixing these errors.\n\n6. **Encoding**: The file must be properly encoded (typically UTF-8). If the encoding is not correct, it could result in incorrect parsing of the content.\n\n7. **Read Permissions**: If the parser does not have the necessary permissions to access or read the file, it will not be able to process the content.\n\nOnce I can view the JSON content, I can attempt to parse it and locate the object with id 's'."
