Nested Objects/Arrays: If the desired object is deeply nested within other objects or arrays, it may require traversing through multiple layers to find it.\n\n3. Non-standard JSON formatting: Sometimes, JSON files might not be properly formatted or might contain comments that are not standard in JSON, which could create parsing issues.\n\n4. Large File Size: If the JSON file is very large, it could take a significant amount of time to parse through the entire file to locate the object with id \"j\".\n\n5.
