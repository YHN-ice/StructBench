Ensuring the correct handling of these types when searching for and interpreting the id is essential.\n\n3. **Keys and Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive. If you're looking for an id with a lowercase 'i', it won't match a key with an uppercase 'I'. It's important to clarify the exact case used in the query.\n\n4. **File Size**: Large JSON files may pose performance issues for processors with limited memory or computational power.\n\n5. **File Encoding**: The JSON file must be correctly encoded (usually UTF-8) to ensure that it can be properly read and interpreted.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: JSON files with missing commas, extra braces, misplaced quotes, or other syntax errors will not parse correctly.\n\n7. **Multiple Entries with Same ID**: If there are multiple objects with the same id within the JSON file, determining which object to return could be ambiguous.\n\nOnce I have access to the JSON file, I can begin to parse it and look for the object with the specified id 'i'.
