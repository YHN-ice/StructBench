        "To identify the most deeply nested objects in the given JSON file that do not contain any list or dict as values, we need to recursively traverse the JSON structure and check for the presence of list or dict data types in the terminal objects.\n\nThe provided JSON input is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"x\",\n  \"Z\": \"k\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"y\",\n      \"Y\": \"j\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"z\",\n          \"X\": \"i\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHere is how we can identify the most deeply nested non-list/dict objects:\n\n1. Start at the root object and traverse the `subs` key, which contains a list of sub-objects.\n2. Continue recursively traversing any `subs` lists found within.\n3. When a `subs` list is empty (i.e., `[]`), we are at a terminal object.\n4. Since values can be directly checked for their type, any terminal object with no `list` or `dict` as its values qualifies.\n\nGiven the input, the most deeply nested object that meets the criteria is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"z\",\n  \"X\": \"i\",\n  \"subs\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis object is at the deepest level and has an empty list for `subs`.
