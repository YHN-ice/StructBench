This means that terminal values could be strings, numbers, booleans, or `null`, and the algorithm must recognize these as endpoints.\n\n4. **Multiple Deeply Nested Objects**: There might be multiple objects that are equally deeply nested, and all of them need to be identified and returned.\n\n5. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be challenging to process it efficiently without running into performance issues.\n\n6. **Recursive Traversal**: Traversing nested JSON objects may require recursive algorithms, which can be complex to implement correctly.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Terms**: The question mentions \"objects,\" which typically refers to dictionary-type structures in JSON (`{}`). However, clarification on whether this term includes other terminal values or if it's strictly about `{}` structures is needed.\n\n8. **Formatting and Output**: Extracting the exact excerpt as it appears in the JSON file while maintaining the formatting can be challenging, especially when considering whitespace, indentation, and other formatting nuances.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, one would need to write a recursive function that tracks the depth of each object, differentiates between terminal and non-terminal values, and collects excerpts of the most deeply nested terminal objects. Efficient handling of the file would also be necessary to avoid performance issues."
