Keys might not be consistent, and the types of values can vary widely, which requires a flexible parsing approach.\n\n4. **Multiple Deep Objects**: There could be several objects at the same level of maximum depth, and identifying all of them could be challenging if the logic isn't set to handle multiple instances.\n\n5. **Complex Data Types**: Even though we're not considering lists or dicts, there might be other complex data types (such as strings that contain serialized JSON) which could complicate the parsing.\n\n6. **Formatting Issues**: The JSON file could contain formatting errors or may not adhere to the standard JSON structure, which would require additional error handling.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: The file might use an encoding that doesn't match the system's default, which can cause issues when trying to read the file.\n\n8. **Recursive Structures**: If the JSON contains recursive structures, it could potentially lead to infinite loops if not handled correctly.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust JSON parsing algorithm needs to handle recursive structures, keep track of nesting levels, manage memory efficiently, and include error handling for non-standard formats and encodings."
