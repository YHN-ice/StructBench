While I'm not able to physically parse files or visualize their contents, I can guide you through the typical challenges and obstacles one might face during this process:\n\n1. **Complex Nesting:** JSON files can have an intricate structure with multiple levels of nesting. Objects can be nested within other objects or arrays, making it difficult to determine the depth of nesting without a systematic approach.\n\n2. **Arrays vs Objects:** Both objects (key-value pairs) and arrays (ordered lists) can contain nested structures. The challenge is to identify objects that are the most deeply nested and do not themselves contain further objects or arrays.\n\n3. **Large Files:** Very large JSON files may present performance issues, making it difficult to parse them efficiently without specialized tools or programming techniques.\n\n4. **Variability in Structure:** JSON files can have a highly variable structure without a consistent schema. This makes automated parsing more complicated as one cannot make assumptions about the structure or depth of nesting.\n\n5. **Data Types:** Distinguishing between data types (e.g., object, array, string, number, boolean, null) is crucial when looking for nested objects. The task requires ignoring primitives and focusing on objects.\n\n6. **Recursion:** Parsing nested structures often requires recursive algorithms which may be challenging to implement correctly, especially when handling edge cases.\n\n7. **Path Tracking:** To provide meaningful output, it's helpful to track the path of nesting so that the user knows where in the JSON structure the deepest objects are located.\n\n8. **Output Format:** Deciding on an appropriate output format that conveys the necessary information while being understandable and concise can be difficult.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a parser would need to be implemented with careful consideration of these factors to accurately identify and extract the most deeply nested objects in a JSON file."
