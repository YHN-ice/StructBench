Therefore, one must ensure that all paths are explored to find all of the most deeply nested objects.\n\n3. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, parsing and keeping track of the nesting levels might be resource-intensive and could possibly exceed memory or processing constraints.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Depth Measurement**: Deciding what constitutes a \"level\" in the JSON hierarchy can be ambiguous, especially if arrays contain objects or if objects contain arrays that also have nested objects.\n\n5. **Identifying Unique Objects**: Deeply nested structures might contain repeated or similar objects. Identifying unique instances can be difficult without some form of object tracking.\n\n6. **Output Format**: Ensuring that the output format is readable and accurately represents the structure of the JSON file can be challenging, especially when presenting excerpts that must reflect the object's nesting context.\n\n7. **Data Types**: JSON supports various data types including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and nulls. Deeply nested objects with simple data types need to be distinguished from those with complex types (arrays, objects).\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a systematic approach to traverse the JSON structure is essential. This might involve recursive functions or iterative approaches with stack-like structures to keep track of visited nodes and their depth levels.
