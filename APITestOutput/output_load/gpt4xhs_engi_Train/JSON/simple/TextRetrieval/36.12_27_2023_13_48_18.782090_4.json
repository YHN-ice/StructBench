Varying Depths: JSON objects can be nested at various levels, and some branches may be deeper than others. Identifying the deepest level requires traversing the entire structure.\n\n2. Complex Structures: JSON files can contain a mix of nested objects (dictionaries) and lists, which can have their own nested objects. We must be able to distinguish between different types and only consider dictionaries for the deepest nesting.\n\n3. Recursive Traversal: Parsing nested structures often requires a recursive approach. Without care, this can lead to stack overflow errors for very deeply nested structures or infinite loops if there are circular references (which are generally not allowed in JSON but could be present in improperly constructed files).\n\n4. Identifying Terminal Objects: We need to differentiate between objects that are containers (i.e., those that contain other objects or lists) and terminal objects, which do not contain any nested structures.\n\n5. Multiple Occurrences: There may be more than one object that qualifies as \"most deeply nested,\" so we need to ensure all such instances are identified and returned.\n\n6.
