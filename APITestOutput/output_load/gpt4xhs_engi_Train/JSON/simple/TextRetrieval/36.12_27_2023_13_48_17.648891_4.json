Identifying the deepest level requires a comparison across all branches.\n\n3. **Mixed Data Types**: JSON objects can contain mixed data types, including other objects and arrays. Determining the nesting level might be complicated if arrays and objects are intermixed.\n\n4. **Recursive Structures**: If the JSON contains recursive structures, it might be difficult to identify the end of the nesting without special handling for such cases.\n\n5. **Similar Keys at Different Levels**: Identifying unique paths to the most deeply nested objects can be hindered by the presence of similar or identical keys at different levels of the structure.\n\n6. **Large Arrays**: Large arrays may contain objects, and those objects could themselves be deeply nested, making it harder to parse through every element.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is not properly encoded, it can cause parsing errors which would need to be handled.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, recursive functions or iterative approaches with stacks or queues can be used to programmatically traverse the JSON structure, keeping track of the maximum depth reached and extracting the objects at that level. Handling of special cases and ensuring proper encoding would also be necessary for accurate parsing."
