An array can contain multiple objects, and objects can have properties that are arrays or other objects. Identifying the terminal nodes where no further nesting occurs (i.e., no list or dict type values) requires careful traversal.\n\n3. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the nested objects do not contain values of type list or dict means checking the data type of each value in each object.\n\n4. **Multiple Deepest Nodes**: There could be multiple objects at the same depth which is the deepest, so we need to ensure we find all objects at this depth.\n\n5. **Formatting Output**: Once the most deeply nested objects have been identified, they need to be presented in a way that matches the requirements, which in this case seems to require preserving their appearance as excerpts from the original JSON.\n\n6. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is particularly large, it could pose a challenge for processing, especially if the entire file needs to be read into memory.\n\n7. **Cyclic References**: While not typically an issue with JSON files, if an object references itself directly or indirectly, it could create difficulties in determining the depth; however, such cases are generally invalid in JSON.\n\n8. **Performance Considerations**: Depending on the size and complexity of the JSON file, performance can be a concern. Efficient parsing and depth calculation would be necessary for large files.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we'll need to parse it and handle these potential issues to extract the most deeply nested objects without list or dict types as their values."
