Ensuring that the data extraction handles these correctly is important.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: The file might use a character encoding that is not properly handled, which could result in incorrect interpretation of the characters.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: The JSON file might contain syntax errors that make it invalid, which would require error handling to either correct or report these issues.\n\n6. **Multiple Objects with Same ID**: There could be multiple objects with the id 'k', in which case it would need to be clarified whether to return the first occurrence, all occurrences, or handle it in some other specific way.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Instructions**: If the term \"object with id k\" is not clear, it might refer to an object having an attribute \"id\" with the value \"k\" or it could refer to some form of identifier within the JSON structure that signifies an object named or labeled 'k'.\n\n8. **Missing Data**: The object with id 'k' might not exist in the JSON file, which would require handling for such cases.\n\n9. **Dynamically Generated IDs**: If IDs are generated dynamically and not statically defined in the JSON file, finding the object with id 'k' could require understanding the generation logic.\n\n10. **Multiple Levels of Identifiers**: The id 'k' could be at various levels of nesting within the JSON file, making it necessary to search recursively or through multiple levels of the structure.\n\nOnce we have access to the JSON file, we can address these potential obstacles specifically and extract the requested information accordingly."
