I need to correctly identify and handle these data types to avoid mistaking a list or dict for a simple object.\n\n3. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is particularly large, it can be challenging to parse the entire file without efficient memory and processing strategies.\n\n4. **Similar Keys in Different Levels**: Keys in JSON objects can have the same name but exist at different levels of nesting. Distinguishing between these keys requires careful tracking of the hierarchical structure.\n\n5. **Handling Multiple Deepest Objects**: There could be multiple objects tied for being the most deeply nested. It's crucial to ensure that all such objects are identified and presented.\n\n6. **Recursive Data**: JSON structures can sometimes be recursive, which could lead to infinite loops if not handled correctly during parsing.\n\n7. **Incorrect Formatting**: If the JSON file has formatting issues or errors, it might not be parsed correctly unless there is error handling in place.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser needs to traverse the JSON structure systematically, keep track of nesting levels, handle each data type appropriately, manage memory efficiently for large files, deal with recursive structures carefully, and include error handling mechanisms for any formatting issues."
