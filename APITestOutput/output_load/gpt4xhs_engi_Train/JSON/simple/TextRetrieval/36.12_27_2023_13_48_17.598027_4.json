It requires careful inspection to ensure that the objects considered do not contain further nested lists or dictionaries.\n\n3. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is particularly large, it can be difficult to manually identify the most deeply nested objects due to the sheer volume of data.\n\n4. **Recursive Structures**: Sometimes, JSON objects can be recursive, meaning an object might indirectly contain a reference to itself through nested objects. Detecting and handling such cases programmatically can be complex.\n\n5. **Similar Keys**: JSON objects can contain keys with the same name but at different nesting levels. Ensuring that the correct level is identified for each key is important.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains non-standard encodings or special characters, it could cause issues when parsing the content.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Data Types**: The values associated with the same key in different parts of a JSON file could be of different types (e.g., a mix of strings, numbers, booleans), which might add complexity when determining whether an object is the most deeply nested without further lists or dicts.\n\nWithout seeing the actual JSON file, it's difficult to anticipate all possible issues, but these are some general challenges that might be encountered."
