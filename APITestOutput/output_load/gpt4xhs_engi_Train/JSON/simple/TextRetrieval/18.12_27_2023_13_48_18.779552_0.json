Determining which one to provide could be challenging unless additional context is given.\n\n3. **Large Data Set**: If the JSON file is very large, efficiently locating the specific object without impacting performance could be difficult.\n\n4. **Data Types and Formats**: Ensuring that the parser correctly interprets different data types and formats within the JSON file (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, nulls) is important for accurate data extraction.\n\n5. **Encoding and Character Sets**: The file might use different character encodings, which could affect the parsing process if not handled correctly.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: Any syntax errors in the JSON file could prevent successful parsing.
