The object with the desired ID might be deeply nested within other objects or arrays, which can make it more challenging to locate.\n\n3. **Non-Unique IDs**: If the ID is not unique and appears multiple times in the file, it may be difficult to determine which object is the correct one without additional context.\n\n4. **Dynamic or Inconsistent Schema**: If the JSON structure is not consistent (e.g., the format varies or uses dynamic keys), finding the correct object could become more complicated.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors in JSON**: Any errors in the JSON syntax, such as missing commas or brackets, can prevent proper parsing of the file.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the file uses a character encoding that is not properly handled, some data might be misinterpreted or cause errors during parsing.\n\n7. **Large Numbers of Objects/Keys**: A file with a high number of objects or keys may require efficient search algorithms to find the object with the given ID without vastly impacting performance.\n\n8. **Lack of Indexing**: Unlike databases, JSON files don't have indexing capabilities. Searching for an object with a particular ID requires scanning through all objects if no optimizations are applied.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one might need to employ streaming or chunk-based processing for large files, recursion for nested structures, validation to ensure IDs are unique and the JSON is correctly formatted, and appropriate character encoding handling.
