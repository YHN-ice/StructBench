Ensuring that the \"id\" field is a string and not a different data type (like a number or boolean) is important for accurate identification.\n\n5. **Formatting Issues**: If the JSON file has formatting errors or is not properly structured as per JSON standards, parsing might fail.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text shall be encoded in UTF-8, but if the file has encoding issues, characters might not be represented correctly, which can lead to difficulties in finding matches.\n\n7. **Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive.
