Identifying the depth and structure correctly requires careful parsing.\n\n2. **Mixed Data Types**: A JSON object may contain mixed data types including nested lists and dictionaries. The challenge is to identify objects that are nested but do not themselves contain any list or dictionary.\n\n3. **Large JSON Files**: If the JSON file is large, it may be challenging to process it efficiently without running into performance issues.\n\n4. **Ambiguities in Definition**: The definition of \"most deeply nested\" might be ambiguous. It could refer to the object with the greatest number of parent objects, or it could be interpreted to mean the object that is most deeply nested where none of its children are lists or dictionaries.\n\n5. **Identical Structures at Different Depths**: There might be cases where objects with identical structures appear at different depths, requiring the parser to identify all instances or the one at the greatest depth.\n\n6. **Recursive Structures**: JSON files can have recursive structures which might create difficulties in traversal without proper checks.\n\n7. **Variations in JSON Formatting**: The JSON file could have variations in formatting such as extra whitespace, newlines, or unconventional ordering of keys which could pose challenges in parsing.\n\n8. **Handling of JSON Arrays**: Since we are interested in objects (dicts), JSON arrays (lists) could be an obstacle as they may contain objects within them.\n\n9. **Size Limits**: Depending on the environment in which the parser operates, there might be size limits to the input that can be processed, which may cause issues with very large JSON files.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing strategy is required.
