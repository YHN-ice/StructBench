Determining the most deeply nested objects requires traversing through all these levels.\n\n2. **Similar Structures at Multiple Depths**: Multiple objects might have a similar structure but at different nesting levels, requiring careful consideration to determine the actual deepest level.\n\n3. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be challenging to parse it efficiently without running into performance issues.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Defining \"Most Deeply Nested\"**: Depending on the structure of the JSON, there might be ambiguity in what is considered the \"most deeply nested\". For example, if two objects are at the same depth but in different branches of the hierarchy, it might be difficult to establish which one to consider or if both should be considered.\n\n5. **No Clear Indication of Object Types**: JSON does not explicitly label types like 'list' or 'dict'; rather, it uses array and object notation. We need clear criteria to differentiate between these types as we parse.\n\n6. **Formatting and Parsing Errors**: There may be issues with the formatting of the JSON file that can lead to parsing errors, such as missing commas or brackets, which can make it difficult to interpret the structure properly.\n\n7. **Recursion and Iteration Logic**: Parsing deeply nested structures typically requires recursion or iterative logic, which can become complex and error-prone if not managed correctly.\n\nWithout the specific JSON file structure, it's hard to predict all potential issues, but these are common challenges faced when working with deeply nested JSON data.
