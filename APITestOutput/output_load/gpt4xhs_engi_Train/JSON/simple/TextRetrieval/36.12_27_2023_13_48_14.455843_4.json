Identifying Types: Distinguishing between different data types (such as lists, dicts, strings, numbers, etc.) at each level of nesting to ensure that only the deepest objects without a list or dict are selected.\n\n3. Handling Duplicate Paths: There could be multiple paths leading to similarly deeply nested objects, and it might be necessary to identify all unique instances.\n\n4. Large Files: If the JSON file is very large, it could be challenging to process it efficiently without running into memory or performance issues.\n\n5.
