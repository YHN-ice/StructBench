Distinguishing between these and handling each appropriately is essential for identifying the deepest objects.\n\n3. **Recursion:** A recursive strategy might be needed to navigate through the nested structures. Ensuring that the recursion correctly identifies and returns the deepest objects without being misled by intermediate lists or dictionaries can be tricky.\n\n4. **Multiple Deep Objects:** There might be multiple objects at the same maximum depth. Identifying all of them requires maintaining a collection of the current deepest objects and updating it as deeper ones are found.\n\n5. **Equivalent Paths:** There could be equivalent paths with different content. Keeping track of unique paths is necessary if the goal is to list different deeply nested objects rather than counting them.\n\n6. **Circular References:** Although rare and non-standard, JSON structures can sometimes have circular references (which is not actually valid JSON). Handling or detecting them may be necessary depending on the tool used to parse the JSON.\n\n7. **Large Files:** If the JSON file is very large, performance considerations may become important, as naive recursive algorithms could lead to stack overflow or excessive memory consumption.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a well-thought-out algorithm that methodically traverses the JSON structure is necessary, possibly employing iterative methods with a stack to manage depth or a recursive approach with careful base cases and memoization to handle large structures efficiently."
