It can be a challenge to determine the maximum depth and identify objects at that level.\n\n2. **Variability in Data Types**: Different data types like lists (arrays) and dictionaries (objects) can be nested inside one another. The task is to find the deepest object where no further list or dictionary is present as a value.\n\n3. **Large Data Sets**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be difficult to parse it manually or even load it into memory all at once. Efficient parsing libraries or streaming parsers may be needed to handle such cases.\n\n4. **Understanding \"Most Deeply Nested\"**: Clarifying what counts as \"most deeply nested\" is important. Is it the object with the most parent layers above it, or is it the structure that's furthest away from the root regardless of the type?\n\n5. **Multiple Occurrences**: There could be multiple objects at the same maximum depth. All instances need to be identified and extracted.\n\n6. **Correct Interpretation of Structure**: Ensuring that the parser correctly understands and navigates the JSON structure, respecting its hierarchies and not confusing keys with values or missing nested objects.\n\n7. **Data Integrity**: The parser must maintain the integrity of the data, ensuring that no information is lost or altered during extraction.\n\nEach of these obstacles requires careful consideration during the parsing process to ensure an accurate response to the question.
