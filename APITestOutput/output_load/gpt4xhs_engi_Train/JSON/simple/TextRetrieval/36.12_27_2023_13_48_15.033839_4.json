Determining the object with no list (array) or dictionary (object) as a value requires inspecting each value and understanding its type.\n\n5. **Similar Keys in Different Levels**: There could be keys with the same name at different levels of nesting, which could cause confusion if we're not careful about keeping track of the hierarchy.\n\n6. **Inadequate Information**: Without seeing the JSON structure, it's not possible to predict what specific challenges the file might present.
