Different Types of Values: Objects can have keys pointing to various types of values (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, arrays). Distinguishing between these and only considering objects that contain no nested lists or dictionaries requires type checking.\n\n3. Multiple Deeply Nested Objects: There might be multiple objects at the same level of nesting. Identifying all of them instead of just the first encountered one is necessary to answer the question comprehensively.\n\n4. Large Files: If the JSON file is very large, it might be inefficient or even impractical to load it entirely into memory. Streaming parsers or iterative approaches might be required to handle such files without running into memory issues.\n\n5.
