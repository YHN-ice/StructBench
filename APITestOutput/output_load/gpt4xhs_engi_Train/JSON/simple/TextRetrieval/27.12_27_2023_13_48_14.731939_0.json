If not handled correctly, this can lead to missed matches or errors.\n\n6. **Missing or Null ID Values:** If some objects do not have an `id` or the `id` is null, it can complicate the search process.\n\n7. **Performance Constraints:** If the parser needs to maintain performance while searching through a potentially large and complex JSON file, it may need to employ streaming or incremental parsing techniques.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues:** JSON files could use various character encodings, and if not handled properly, this could result in incorrect interpretation of text.\n\n9. **Error Handling:** The JSON file might contain errors or might not be well-formed, requiring robust error handling logic in the parser.\n\n10. **Access Restrictions:** Depending on the environment, there may be restrictions accessing the file (for example, due to permissions or being located on a remote server).\n\nOnce we have access to the JSON file and understand its structure, we can develop a more targeted approach to overcome these potential obstacles."
