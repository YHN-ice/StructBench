If the data type is not as expected, additional handling might be required.\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, efficiency and performance could become concerns. Processing large files might require more memory and could slow down the response time.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: If the file is not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), there might be issues with reading special characters or symbols.\n\n6. **File Accessibility**: The JSON file needs to be accessible for reading.
