We would need a strategy for handling large files, like streaming the data instead of loading it all at once.\n\n3. **Complex Nesting:** JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays.

Ensuring that the parser correctly handles each type is important for accurate data retrieval.\n\n8. **Accessing Nested Arrays/Objects:** The 'subs' might be a nested array within the JSON structure, so knowing how to access elements within nested arrays or objects is critical.\n\nTo proceed effectively, we will assume that the JSON file is correctly formatted and that I have a method to parse and access the data within.
