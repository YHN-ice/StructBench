Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Invalid JSON Format:** If the JSON file is not properly formatted, it can cause parsing errors. This includes missing commas, brackets, or quotation marks.\n   \n2. **Nested Structures:** JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays. Identifying the correct path to the desired data (in this case, the first object's id within an array named 'subs') can be tricky if the structure is complex.\n\n3. **Large File Size:** If the JSON file is very large, it can be challenging to process it efficiently without running into memory or performance issues.\n\n4. **Data Type Confusion:** JSON supports different data types, such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring that the correct data type is handled when retrieving the 'id' is important.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues:** If the JSON file contains special characters or is encoded in a different charset, it might not be read correctly without the appropriate handling.\n\n6. **Ambiguous Keys:** Sometimes JSON files may have keys that are named the same but exist in different parts of the hierarchy. Identifying the right key to answer the question may require careful consideration of the hierarchy.\n\n7. **Tool Limitations:** The capabilities of the JSON parser being used may limit how easily one can navigate and extract information from the JSON file. Some parsers offer more advanced query and filtering capabilities than others.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it is important to:\n\n- Validate the JSON file for correct formatting before parsing.\n- Understand the structure of the JSON file to navigate to the required data.\n- Use a parser that can handle large files and stream data if needed.\n- Pay attention to the data types and encode characters properly.\n- Make sure to reference the correct hierarchical path to access the desired key-value pair.\n\nOnce you provide the JSON input, I'll proceed with parsing it and answering your question regarding the first object's id within the 'subs' array."
