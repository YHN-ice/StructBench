If \"subs\" is nested within several layers of objects or arrays, it may be challenging to reach the correct level to access its contents.\n\n2. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to process it efficiently. Large files may take more time to parse and could potentially cause performance issues.\n\n3. **Data Inconsistency**: If the JSON file does not have a consistent structure (e.g., missing fields, varied object structures), it might be difficult to find the required information.\n\n4. **Ambiguity**: Without clear instructions, there might be ambiguity regarding what constitutes the \"first\" object. For example, if there is no clear ordering or if there are multiple arrays named \"subs,\" it could be unclear which one to look at.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: If the JSON file contains syntax errors, a JSON parser will not be able to read it correctly, which can prevent access to the data altogether.\n\n6. **Incorrect Path**: Identifying the correct path to access the desired data is crucial.
