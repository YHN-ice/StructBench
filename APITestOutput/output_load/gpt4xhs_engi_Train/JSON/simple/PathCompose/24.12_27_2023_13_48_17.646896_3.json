Mistaking array elements can lead to accessing the wrong data.\n\n3. **Similar keys**: If the JSON file contains keys with similar or identical names at different levels, it can be confusing to identify which key to use.\n\n4. **Data type issues**: JSON supports various data types like strings, numbers, objects, and arrays. Ensuring that the access method matches the data type (e.g., using integer indexes for arrays and string keys for objects) is crucial.\n\n5. **Typos and case sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so mistyping a key or using the wrong case can result in an error or access to the wrong value.\n\n6. **Missing or null values**: The JSON file may contain null values or missing keys, which could lead to undefined results when attempting to access them.\n\n7. **Dynamic JSON structure**: If the structure of the JSON is dynamic and changes frequently, writing a hardcoded path to access a value may not be reliable.\n\n8. **Encoding issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is not properly encoded in UTF-8, parsing errors may occur.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, you should:\n\n- Carefully inspect the JSON structure to understand the hierarchy and paths.\n- Use the correct indices for arrays and the correct key names for objects.\n- Handle potential errors or missing data gracefully.\n- Ensure that the JSON file is properly formatted and encoded.\n- Write flexible code that can handle changes in the JSON structure if applicable."
