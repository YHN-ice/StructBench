Nested Structures: JSON files often contain nested objects and arrays. Accurately navigating through these layers to reach the target value can be challenging if the structure is complex or deeply nested.\n\n2. Keys with Similar Names: If the JSON object contains keys with similar or identical names at different levels of nesting, it can be confusing to determine which key to use at each step.\n\n3. Arrays with Multiple Elements: When the value being accessed is within an array, it is important to know the correct index to use. If the array is large or contains objects with many attributes, this can be error-prone.\n\n4. Dynamic Structures: If the JSON structure is dynamic and changes frequently, a hardcoded path to a certain value may not always be valid, leading to errors in data retrieval.\n\n5. Typographical Errors: Typos in key names or indices can lead to incorrect paths and failure to retrieve the correct value.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: JSON keys are case-sensitive. Using the wrong case when accessing an object's properties can result in an undefined value.\n\nTo successfully access the value \"e\" from a JSON object, it is important to carefully understand and navigate the structure, pay attention to the case of keys, and ensure that the correct indices are used for any arrays in the path.
