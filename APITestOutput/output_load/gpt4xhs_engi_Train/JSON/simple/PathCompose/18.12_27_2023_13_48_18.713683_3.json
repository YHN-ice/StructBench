Here are some of the common challenges:\n\n1. **Nested Objects and Arrays**: JSON files can have multiple levels of nested objects and arrays, which might make it tricky to navigate to the correct key or index.\n2. **Key Names**: If keys are dynamic or not known beforehand, it might be difficult to determine the correct path to a value.\n3. **Data Types**: JSON can contain various data types, like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring the correct data type is being accessed is important.\n4. **Large Files**: Large JSON files may be difficult to navigate, and finding the correct key or path may be time-consuming without an automated process or tool.\n5. **Syntax Errors**: JSON has a strict syntax. Missing commas, extra quotes, or incorrect brackets can cause parsing errors.\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If a JSON file has encoding issues or contains special characters, it may lead to issues when trying to parse or access data.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one needs to be familiar with the structure of the JSON file, understand how to navigate nested objects and arrays, ensure that the correct key names are used, and take care when interpreting data types. Additionally, using JSON parsing tools or libraries that provide methods for safely navigating and accessing values can help avoid errors."
