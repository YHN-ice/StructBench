Mistaking the data type could lead to accessing a non-existent key on a string or trying to use an array method on an object, for example.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: Incorrect syntax while writing the access path can lead to errors. For example, using incorrect brackets or forgetting quotes around string keys.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is encoded in a non-standard format, this might cause issues when trying to parse or access certain elements.\n\n8. **Data Size**: If the JSON file is very large, it could cause performance issues, making it difficult to quickly access the required data.\n\nTo successfully navigate these potential obstacles, one must carefully inspect the JSON structure, understand the data types involved, and use proper syntax while constructing the access path."
