Understanding the structure and knowing the correct path to access the desired value can be challenging if the nesting is deep or complex.\n\n2. **Similar Keys**: If there are keys with similar or identical names at different levels of the hierarchy, it might be confusing to identify which key to use at each step.\n\n3. **Arrays with Multiple Objects**: If the JSON file contains arrays with multiple objects, accessing a value requires knowing the correct index of the object within the array.\n\n4. **Dynamic Keys**: Sometimes, keys in JSON objects are dynamic or generated programmatically, making it hard to predict the exact key to access beforehand.\n\n5. **Type Confusion**: JSON supports different data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Knowing the data type of each element is crucial because accessing a value from an object differs from accessing an element within an array.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors in JSON**: Invalid JSON formatting, such as missing commas, brackets, or quotes can lead to parsing errors, making it impossible to access the data without correcting the syntax first.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is encoded in a different charset, it might require additional handling to parse correctly.\n\n8. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be inefficient to parse the whole file if you only need to access a specific value.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one must carefully inspect the JSON structure, understand the types and hierarchy of elements involved, and write precise access paths considering array indices and object keys. Tools like JSON formatters or linters can be used to validate and visualize the structure to aid in this process."
