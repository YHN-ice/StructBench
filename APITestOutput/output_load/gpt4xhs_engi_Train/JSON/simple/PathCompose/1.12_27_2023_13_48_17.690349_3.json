Nested Structures: JSON objects can have multiple levels of nested objects or arrays. It's important to know the exact structure to navigate through the levels properly.\n\n2. Keys with Similar Names: If the JSON has keys with similar names or duplicate keys within different scopes, it can be confusing to determine which key path leads to the desired value.\n\n3. Arrays vs. Objects: JSON can contain both arrays (ordered collections) and objects (unordered collections with key-value pairs). Knowing whether to use an index or a key at each level is crucial.\n\n4. Data Types: Ensuring that the accessed value is of the expected data type (string, number, boolean, object, array, null) is important to avoid runtime errors.\n\n5. Dynamic Keys: Sometimes, JSON keys can be dynamic or generated based on some condition. In such cases, you might not have a fixed key path to access the value.\n\n6. Case Sensitivity: JSON keys are case-sensitive. Thus, 'Key', 'KEY', and 'key' would be considered different keys.\n\n7. Typos and Errors: Simple typos in keys or incorrect indexes in arrays can lead to accessing the wrong value or result in an error.\n\n8. Handling Errors: Properly handling errors in case of missing keys or out-of-bound array indexes is essential to ensure the robustness of the code that parses the JSON.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it's important to inspect the JSON structure carefully and write code that gracefully handles any unexpected conditions."
