Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Nested Objects or Arrays**: JSON files can contain nested objects or arrays. Knowing the correct path to the desired value, including all keys and indices for arrays, is essential.\n\n2. **Key Names**: JSON keys are case-sensitive. Therefore, it's important to use the exact key names, including the correct casing, to access the associated values.\n\n3. **Data Types**: The value accessed could be a string, number, object, array, boolean, or null. Handling each data type correctly is crucial for processing the value further.\n\n4. **Dynamically Named Keys**: Sometimes JSON objects contain keys that are dynamically generated and not known beforehand. This might require iterating over keys or having some logic to identify the correct key to use.\n\n5. **Arrays with Mixed Types**: If an array contains mixed data types or nested structures, accessing a specific element might require additional checks or steps.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be challenging to navigate through it without proper tools or methods to parse and access the data efficiently.\n\n7. **Invalid JSON Format**: If the input JSON is not properly formatted, parsing errors could occur that prevent accessing any data at all.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or is encoded in a different charset, it might cause issues while parsing and accessing the data.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one should ensure to:\n- Understand the structure of the JSON file.\n- Use the correct keys and indices.\n- Handle different data types appropriately.\n- Deal with dynamically named keys and mixed-type arrays carefully.\n- Use efficient methods for parsing large files.\n- Validate the JSON format before attempting to parse it.\n- Handle encoding issues if they arise."
