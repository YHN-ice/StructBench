Mistaking one for the other can lead to incorrect access paths.\n\n3. **Similar Keys**: If the JSON file contains keys with similar or identical names at different nesting levels, it can be confusing to ensure that you're referencing the correct one.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the value being accessed is of the expected data type (e.g., string, number, boolean, object, array) is important, especially when the JSON schema is not known in advance.\n\n5. **Dynamic Structure**: If the structure of the JSON is dynamic or changes frequently, writing a generic access path can be challenging.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: Small syntax errors like missing brackets or incorrect key names can lead to failed access attempts or runtime errors.\n\n7. **Large Files**: When dealing with large JSON files, performance can become an issue, and reading or parsing the file might require stream processing or other optimization techniques.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is necessary to gracefully handle cases where keys do not exist or unexpected data types are encountered.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful inspection of the JSON structure, iterative testing, and possibly using schema validation or tools that help visualize JSON structures can be useful.
