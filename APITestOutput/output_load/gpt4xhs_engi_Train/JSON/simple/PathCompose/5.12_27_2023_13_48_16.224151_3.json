A common mistake is to use one-based indexing, which would lead to an off-by-one error.\n\n3. **Key Sensitivity:** JSON keys are case-sensitive. If the key is not referred to with the exact same case, it will not match, and the value cannot be accessed.\n\n4. **Data Types:** JSON supports different data types like numbers, strings, booleans, null, objects, and arrays. It's important to be aware of the data type when accessing the value to perform the correct operation or method.\n\n5. **Dynamic Keys:** Sometimes keys can be dynamic or generated at runtime, making it difficult to know the exact path without additional logic or data processing.\n\n6. **Error Handling:** When accessing nested keys, if any key along the path doesn't exist, it might cause an error like `undefined` in JavaScript if not handled properly.\n\n7. **Large Files:** Large JSON files may be difficult to navigate and may require tools or scripts to parse effectively.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors:** Invalid JSON format due to syntax errors like missing commas, quotes, or brackets can prevent proper parsing of the file.\n\n9. **Encoding Issues:** If the JSON file includes special characters or is not encoded in UTF-8, there could be issues when parsing strings.\n\n10. **File Accessibility:** There might be problems with file permissions or reading files from certain locations that could prevent access to the JSON content.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues can help in preemptively addressing them during the parsing process."
