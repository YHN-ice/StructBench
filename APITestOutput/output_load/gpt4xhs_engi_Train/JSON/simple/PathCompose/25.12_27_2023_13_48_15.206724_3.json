Nested structures: JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays, which can make the path to a specific value complex. Determining the correct sequence of keys and indices to reach the desired value requires careful navigation.\n\n2. Dynamic keys: If the JSON structure includes keys that are generated dynamically or change frequently, it becomes harder to predict the exact path to a given value without prior knowledge of the structure.\n\n3. Arrays with variable lengths: When dealing with arrays within the JSON, it can be challenging to know the correct index to use if the array lengths are not consistent or known ahead of time.\n\n4. Similar keys at different levels: There could be keys with the same name at different nesting levels, leading to confusion about which one to reference.\n\n5. Type mismatches: Expecting a certain type (e.g., object, array, string, number) at a certain level and encountering a different type could lead to access errors.\n\n6. Ambiguous paths: Multiple paths could potentially lead to similar-looking values, making it unclear which path is correct for the desired value.\n\n7. Large and complex JSON: In very large JSON files, simply finding the relevant section can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n8. Syntax errors: Incorrect use of brackets, quotes, or commas could result in syntax errors that prevent successful parsing.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it's important to have a clear understanding of the JSON structure, verify that the path is correct at each step, handle potential variations in array lengths or dynamic keys, and ensure that syntax is properly used when constructing access paths."
