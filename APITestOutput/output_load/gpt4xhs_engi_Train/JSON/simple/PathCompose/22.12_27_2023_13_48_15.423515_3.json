Nested Structures: JSON files can contain deeply nested structures, making it complex to navigate to the correct level to find the desired data.\n\n2. Arrays vs. Objects: JSON supports both arrays (ordered lists) and objects (unordered collections of key-value pairs). Identifying whether the data is stored in an array or an object and using the appropriate index or key to access it can be challenging.\n\n3. Keys with Similar Names: JSON objects may contain keys with similar or identical names at different levels of the hierarchy. This could lead to confusion about which key to reference.\n\n4. Dynamic Structure: If the JSON structure is not fixed or changes frequently, it can be tough to write a stable path to access the data. It might require additional logic to handle the variability.\n\n5. Typos and Case Sensitivity: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so a typo or incorrect case can prevent access to the correct value.\n\n6. Dealing with Data Types: JSON supports various data types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects. Ensuring that the data is accessed with consideration of its type is crucial.\n\n7. Large Files: For very large JSON files, performance considerations might come into play when parsing and accessing data.\n\n8.
