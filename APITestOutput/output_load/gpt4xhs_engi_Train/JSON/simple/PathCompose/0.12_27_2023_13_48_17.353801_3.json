Key names are case-sensitive and sometimes might be confusing or similar to one another.\n\n3. **Arrays**: If the value is stored within an array, you need to know the correct index to access it. Arrays are zero-indexed, so the first element is at index 0.\n\n4. **Data types**: Knowing the type of data (object, array, string, number, boolean, null) you're accessing is important as it determines how you interact with it.\n\n5. **Error handling**: If you try to access a key or index that does not exist, it could result in an error. Handling these scenarios gracefully is important.\n\n6. **Dynamic structure**: If the JSON structure is dynamic and changes frequently, it may be difficult to hard-code the path to a specific value without additional logic to handle these changes.\n\n7. **Large files**: If the JSON file is very large, there could be performance considerations when parsing and searching for a value.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it's important to:\n- Understand the JSON structure by examining it carefully or using schema documentation if available.\n- Use proper error handling in case of missing keys or out-of-bounds indices.\n- Optimize for performance when dealing with large JSON files, perhaps by using streaming parsers or other techniques.\n- Write flexible code that can handle potential changes in the JSON structure if applicable.\n\nNow, if you could provide the JSON file or its structure, I could help you determine how to access the value \"d\"."
