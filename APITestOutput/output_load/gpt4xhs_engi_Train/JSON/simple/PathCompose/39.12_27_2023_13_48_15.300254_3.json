If arrays are large or dynamic, finding the right index might not be straightforward.\n\n4. **Type Mismatches**: JSON supports various data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring that you’re accessing the right type (e.g., not trying to use an index on an object or a key on an array) is important.\n\n5. **Dynamic Data**: If the structure of the JSON data is dynamic and changes frequently, hardcoded paths to data may break, and thus, dynamic resolution methods need to be implemented.\n\n6. **Key Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so 'Key' and 'key' would be considered different. It’s important to use the exact key as it appears in the JSON file.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: Proper JSON syntax must be followed when accessing elements. A missing bracket, comma, or quote can cause errors in parsing.\n\n8. **Data Size**: Large JSON files may be challenging to manage and parse manually.
