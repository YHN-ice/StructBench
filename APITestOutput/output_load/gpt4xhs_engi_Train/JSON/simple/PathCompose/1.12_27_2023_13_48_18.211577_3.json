A type mismatch can occur if the expected type of a value is different from what's actually present in the JSON.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: A very large JSON file could potentially result in performance issues, making it tough to parse and work with efficiently.\n\n5. **Invalid JSON Format**: If the JSON file is not properly formatted (e.g., missing commas, extra braces, syntax errors), parsing errors will occur.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the file encoding is not UTF-8 or if there are special characters that aren't properly encoded, it could lead to issues in parsing and interpreting the data.\n\n7. **Access Permissions**: There may be restrictions on accessing the file itself due to file permissions or it being located on a secure server.\n\nEach of these potential issues would need to be addressed in order to accurately access and interpret the value \"p\" from a given JSON file.
