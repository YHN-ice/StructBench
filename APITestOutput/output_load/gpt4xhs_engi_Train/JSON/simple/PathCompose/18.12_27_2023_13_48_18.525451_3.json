Identifying whether to use an index (for an array) or a key (for an object) at each level is crucial.\n\n3. **Similar Keys**: The JSON file might contain multiple keys with the same name at different levels of the hierarchy. Distinguishing the correct path requires careful attention to the structure.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues**: Ensuring that the accessed value is of the expected data type (string, number, boolean, etc.) is important to prevent errors in processing the data.\n\n5. **Large Files**: For very large JSON files, efficiently parsing and finding the required information without excessive resource consumption can be a challenge.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: JSON is strict in its syntax. Missing commas, quotation marks, or brackets can lead to parsing errors. Proper error handling is necessary to identify and correct syntax issues.\n\n7. **Encoding and Escaping**: Ensuring that the file encoding is correct and that special characters are properly escaped according to JSON standards is essential for successful parsing.\n\n8. **Path Misinterpretation**: Human error in interpreting the correct path to a deeply nested value can lead to incorrect answers.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful analysis of the JSON structure, attention to detail, and potentially using a JSON parsing tool or library can aid in accurately accessing the desired value."
