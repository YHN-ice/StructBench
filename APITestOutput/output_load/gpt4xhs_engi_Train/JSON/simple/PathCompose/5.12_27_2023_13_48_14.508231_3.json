If the keys are not known beforehand, it might be difficult to determine the correct path without analyzing the structure.\n\n3. **Array Indices**: If the value is within an array, one must know the correct index to access the value. If the array is large or the values are not ordered, finding the correct index could be tricky.\n\n4. **Similar Keys**: If there are multiple keys with the same name at different levels of nesting, it can be confusing to identify which key to reference in the path.\n\n5. **Typographical Errors**: When specifying the path, typographical errors such as misspelled keys or incorrect indices can lead to wrong answers.\n\n6. **Dynamic Data**: If the JSON data is dynamic and changes over time, the path that worked at one point may not work later if the structure has changed.\n\n7. **Data Type Confusion**: Confusing an object with an array (or vice versa) due to similar-looking syntax (e.g., curly braces {} for objects and square brackets [] for arrays) can lead to incorrect path specifications.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, one would need to carefully inspect the JSON structure, ensure understanding of whether each level is an object or an array, pay attention to keys and indices, and approach the task methodically."
