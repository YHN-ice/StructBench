Ensuring you are accessing the right type at each level is important to avoid errors.\n\n4. **Keys with Special Characters**: Sometimes, JSON keys may contain spaces or other special characters that could require different access methods (e.g., `obj[\"key with space\"]` instead of `obj.key_with_space`).\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so it's important to match the exact casing of the keys when trying to access their values.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: When navigating through a JSON structure, there's a risk of encountering undefined keys or indices which can throw errors. Error handling is necessary to gracefully handle such cases.\n\n7. **Data Integrity**: The JSON file may contain errors, missing data, or unexpected formats which can cause issues when parsing.\n\nOnce we see the actual JSON structure, we'll have to navigate through these potential challenges to access the value \"j\"."
