Nested structures: JSON can contain nested objects and arrays, so navigating to the correct level can be complex.\n\n2. Keys with similar names: If the JSON contains keys with similar or identical names at different levels of nesting, it can be confusing to select the correct one.\n\n3. Arrays with multiple objects: If the target value is within an array consisting of multiple objects, determining the correct index to access the desired object might be challenging.\n\n4. Dynamic or unknown structures: If the structure of the JSON is not known beforehand, dynamically accessing the correct keys or indices can be difficult.\n\n5. Syntax and typos: Small syntax errors like missing brackets or quotes can lead to issues when trying to access values.\n\n6. Type mismatches: JSON supports different types (e.g., object, array, string, number, boolean, null). Mistaking the type of a value can result in errors when attempting to access it.\n\n7. Large files: For very large JSON files, performance may become an issue and finding the correct path to the value might be time-consuming.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it would be necessary to carefully inspect the JSON structure, use the correct syntax for accessing object properties and array elements, handle potential errors gracefully, and potentially write code or use tools that can navigate and parse JSON efficiently."
