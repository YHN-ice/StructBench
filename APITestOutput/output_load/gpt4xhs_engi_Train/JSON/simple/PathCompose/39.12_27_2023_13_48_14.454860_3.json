This can cause confusion and require careful navigation to reach the desired value.\n\n3. **Arrays and Objects**: Differentiating between objects and arrays is crucial because objects are accessed via keys, while arrays are accessed using indexes. This requires careful attention to the JSON structure.\n\n4. **Dynamic Data**: If the structure of the JSON data is dynamic and changes over time, it might be challenging to provide a static access path that remains valid.\n\n5. **Type Errors**: Mistaking the data type (e.g., trying to use an index on an object or a key on an array) can lead to errors when parsing JSON.\n\n6. **Existence of Keys/Index**: Assuming that a key or index exists without validation may lead to errors if the key or index is not present in the JSON.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: Incorrect syntax such as missing brackets, quotation marks, or using the wrong key/index separator could result in failure to access the correct value.\n\n8. **Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so using the incorrect case when referring to keys may prevent access to the correct value.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one must carefully inspect the JSON file structure and ensure that the path used to access the value is correctly formatted and matches the hierarchy of the JSON data."
