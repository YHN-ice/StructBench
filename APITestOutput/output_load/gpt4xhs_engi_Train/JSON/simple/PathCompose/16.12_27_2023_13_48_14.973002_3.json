Keys with Similar Names: If the JSON structure has keys with similar names or repetitive patterns, it can be confusing to identify the correct path.\n\n3. Case Sensitivity: JSON keys are case-sensitive. \"Key\" and \"key\" would be considered two different keys, so attention to the case is necessary.\n\n4. Dynamic Keys or Indices: If the structure of the JSON file is dynamic, where keys or array indices may change, this could complicate accessing the value \"k\" because a fixed path might not always work.\n\n5. Large Files: If the JSON file is very large, it could be challenging to manually find the key and may require automated tools to parse and search through the data.\n\n6. Data Types: Ensuring that the value accessed is of the expected data type is important. For example, if \"k\" is supposed to be a string but is returned as an integer, this could cause issues.\n\n7. Syntax Errors: A malformed JSON file with syntax errors (e.g., missing commas, quotes, brackets) could prevent proper parsing of the file.\n\n8.
