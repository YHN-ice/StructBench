Without knowing the expected data type, there could be formatting issues or confusions.\n\n5. **Array Indexing**: Assuming that ‘subs’ is an array, it’s necessary to correctly index into the array to find the first object. Indexing errors could lead to retrieving the wrong object.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structures**: The JSON file could contain complex data structures with nested arrays and objects, making it difficult to navigate to the desired information without a clear map of the structure.\n\n7. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is very large, performance might be an issue, and it might take a significant amount of time to parse and locate the required information.\n\nOnce you provide the actual JSON file, these challenges can be more specifically addressed."
