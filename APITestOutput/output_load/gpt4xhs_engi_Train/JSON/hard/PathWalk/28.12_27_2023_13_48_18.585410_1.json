Loading a huge file into memory could lead to performance issues or even crashes depending on the system's resources.\n\n3. **File Structure Complexity**: If the JSON structure is deeply nested or not well-organized, it may be difficult to navigate to the correct part of the file to find the \"subs\" list and extract the first object's ID.\n\n4. **Invalid JSON Format**: If the JSON file contains syntax errors or is not properly formatted, parsing it would result in errors. A JSON parser will expect a valid JSON format to operate correctly.\n\n5. **Variability in Key Names**: The key for the list of objects might not be consistently named \"subs\" or the ID field within the objects of the list might have different names in different objects, which would require additional logic to handle.\n\n6. **Multiple Lists Called \"subs\"**: There might be multiple lists named \"subs\" at various levels of the JSON structure, leading to ambiguity about which list is being referred to.\n\n7. **Data Types**: The ID field's data type might vary (e.g., string or integer), so when extracting it, the parser must handle it appropriately to avoid type errors.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the file contains special characters or has encoding issues, it might not parse correctly, leading to potential misinterpretation of the data.\n\nOnce I have access to the JSON input, I can attempt to parse it while considering these potential difficulties and provide the requested information assuming none of these obstacles prevents me from doing so."
