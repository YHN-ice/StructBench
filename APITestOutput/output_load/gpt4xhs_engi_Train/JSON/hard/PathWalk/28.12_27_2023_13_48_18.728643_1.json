Nested Complexity: The \"subs\" array could be nested within other objects or arrays, which adds complexity to the data traversal needed to reach the first object of interest.\n\n6.

Data Type Consistency: Ensuring that the \"id\" is of the expected data type (e.g., string, integer) and handling any inconsistencies that may arise.\n\n8.
