If there are any issues with the formatting such as missing commas, brackets, or quotation marks, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n3. **Large File Size:** If the JSON file is very large, it can be difficult to manually find the relevant section, and it may require automated tools or scripts to parse efficiently.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Key Names:** Sometimes JSON keys can have similar or duplicate names within different objects. It's important to ensure that we're looking at the correct 'subs' key within the intended context.\n\n5. **Type Mismatch:** There could be a type mismatch where the 'id' is expected to be a string or a number, and if not handled correctly, it could cause errors in retrieval.\n\n6. **Array Indexing:** If 'subs' is an array, we'll need to make sure we're accessing the first element correctly using proper indexing (typically '0' for the first element in an array).\n\n7. **Encoding Issues:** There could be character encoding issues that may prevent proper display or interpretation of the data.\n\n8. **Security Concerns:** If the JSON file contains sensitive information, there might be security protocols that restrict access or require special handling.\n\nTo proceed efficiently, the JSON file needs to be properly formatted and accessible so that I can parse it and locate the 'id' of the first object within the 'subs' array.
