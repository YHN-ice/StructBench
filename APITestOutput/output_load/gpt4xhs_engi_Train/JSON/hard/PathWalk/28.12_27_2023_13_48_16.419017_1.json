Determining which \"subs\" array you are referring to could be problematic.\n\n4. **Non-Standard JSON Formats:** While JSON is a standardized notation, sometimes files may not strictly adhere to the format, which could lead to parsing errors.\n\n5. **Data Integrity Issues:** The JSON file could have missing or corrupted data. For instance, if the \"subs\" array exists but has no objects within it, there would be no \"id\" to report.\n\n6. **Missing or Misnamed Keys:** It is possible that the key expected to hold the id (such as \"id\") might be missing, misnamed, or follow a pattern that requires interpretation.\n\n7. **Typographical and Syntax Errors:** JSON is sensitive to typographical errors such as missing commas, quotation marks, or brackets, which could cause parsing failures.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues:** File encoding issues might corrupt the JSON data leading to characters that can’t be correctly parsed.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, I would need to carefully read and navigate the JSON file structure, ensure the parsing tool can handle large files efficiently, confirm the hierarchy and key naming conventions, handle any potential errors gracefully, and be prepared for any unexpected data formats or integrity issues. \n\nNow that we've considered potential issues, please provide the JSON file so that I can attempt to parse it and answer your question."
