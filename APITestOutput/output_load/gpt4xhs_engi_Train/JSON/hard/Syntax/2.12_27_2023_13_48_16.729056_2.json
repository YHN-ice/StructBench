Common syntax errors include:\n    - Missing commas between elements in an array or between members in an object.\n    - Extra trailing commas at the end of lists or objects.\n    - Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and string values.\n    - Use of single quotes instead of double quotes for strings.\n\n2. **Data Type Issues**: JSON data types include objects, arrays, numbers, strings, `true`, `false`, and `null`. Errors can occur if these are not formatted correctly, such as:\n    - Strings not enclosed in double quotes.\n    - Numbers formatted incorrectly (e.g., leading zeros, non-numeric characters).\n    - Boolean values given as anything other than `true` or `false`.\n    - Null values spelled incorrectly.\n\n3. **Nesting and Structure Problems**: JSON can contain nested arrays and objects, and errors might arise from:\n    - Mismatched braces (`{}`) or brackets (`[]`).\n    - Improperly nested objects or arrays.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.\n\n5. **Non-Standard Extensions**: Some parsers might allow comments or other non-standard features that are not part of the JSON specification.\n\nIf any of these issues are present within the given JSON file, they will prevent the JSON from being properly parsed and will need to be corrected for the JSON to be valid."
