Mismatched or misnested brackets and braces can invalidate the JSON structure.\n\n3. **Quotation Marks**: Keys and string values should be enclosed in double quotes. Missing or incorrect use of quotation marks can cause errors.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Values in JSON can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, `true`, `false`, or `null`. Mistakes in data types or improper formatting (like enclosing numbers in quotes) can lead to structural problems.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas**: While some parsers tolerate trailing commas, they are not allowed in JSON. A trailing comma after the last element of an array or the last member of an object is an error.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8, and characters must be properly escaped. Encoding errors can disrupt the structure.\n\n7. **Comments**: JSON does not officially support comments. Any form of comments within the JSON file would be considered a structural error.\n\n8. **Duplicate Keys**: While not strictly a structural error according to all parsers, duplicate keys within an object can lead to undefined behavior.\n\nIdentifying these issues requires carefully parsing the JSON file while respecting its syntax rules.
