This should either be removed or followed by a key-value pair if it was intended to represent another object.\n\n2. **Missing commas**: There are missing commas at the end of several objects within the array. For example, after the first object within the \"subs\" array for the object with \"id\":\"ab\", and after the second object within the \"subs\" array for the object with \"id\":\"db\".\n\n3. **Mismatched square brackets**: The JSON structure has an excess of open square brackets without the corresponding closing brackets.
