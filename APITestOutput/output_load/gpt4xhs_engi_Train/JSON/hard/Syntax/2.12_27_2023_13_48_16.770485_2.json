A missing or extra comma can cause a structural error.\n\n2. **Mismatched or Unbalanced Brackets**: JSON uses curly braces `{}` for objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays. Every opening bracket must be matched and balanced with a closing bracket in the correct order.\n\n3. **Improper Quotation Marks**: JSON requires double quotes for strings and keys. Single quotes, unquoted keys, or strings, or improper use of double quotes can result in errors.\n\n4. **Data Types Issues**: JSON supports specific data types such as string, number, object, array, boolean, and null. Inserting an unsupported data type or formatting an accepted data type incorrectly (like missing quotes around a string) can cause errors.\n\n5. **Colon Use in Objects**: In JSON, a colon is used to separate keys from their values within an object. Missing or misusing a colon can lead to structural issues.\n\n6. **Trailing Commas**: While some languages allow trailing commas in lists and objects, JSON does not. A comma after the last element in an array or object will cause an error.\n\n7. **Encoding Problems**: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8, and any issues with character encoding can result in errors when parsing the file.\n\n8. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, so any presence of comments would cause a parsing error.\n\nIdentifying these potential issues requires carefully examining the structure of the JSON input provided. Please present the JSON file that you want me to analyze for structural errors."
