Unbalanced or missing brackets and braces: JSON uses square brackets for arrays and curly braces for objects. They must be balanced and properly paired to form a valid structure.\n\n3. Incorrect data types: JSON has specific data types, such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Using an incorrect data type for a value can cause errors.\n\n4. Non-string keys: In JSON, keys must be strings enclosed in double quotes. If a key is not a string or is missing quotes, it is an error.\n\n5. Trailing commas: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an array or the last key-value pair in an object.\n\n6. Encoding issues: JSON text must be encoded using UTF-8 without BOM (Byte Order Mark).\n\n7.
