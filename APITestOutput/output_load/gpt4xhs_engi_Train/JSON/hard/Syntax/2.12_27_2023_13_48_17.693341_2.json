Errors can occur if data types are not correctly used or formatted.\n\n4. **Unquoted Keys:** In JSON, keys must always be strings and thus should be enclosed in double quotes. Unquoted keys would lead to an error.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas:** Although some programming languages or parsers allow trailing commas, standard JSON does not permit a comma after the last key-value pair in an object or the last element in an array.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues:** If the file contains characters not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), this could lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Deeply Nested Structures:** While not an error per se, deeply nested JSON structures can make it difficult to read and parse the data correctly.\n\nTo identify any structural errors present in the given JSON file, I would need to examine the actual content of the JSON.
