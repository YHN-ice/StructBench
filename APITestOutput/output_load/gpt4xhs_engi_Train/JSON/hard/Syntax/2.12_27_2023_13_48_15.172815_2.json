Unquoted keys: In JSON, keys must be strings and should be enclosed in double quotes.\n3. Single quotes around strings: JSON requires double quotes for strings, not single quotes.\n4. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in lists or objects, JSON does not permit this.\n5. Improper nesting: Objects and arrays need to be properly nested within braces `{}` for objects and brackets `[]` for arrays.\n6. Missing brackets or braces: Every JSON array and object must start with `[` or `{` and end with `]` or `}`, respectively.\n7. Data type issues: JSON has specific data types such as number, string, boolean, array, object, and null. Mismatches in these types can lead to errors.\n8.
