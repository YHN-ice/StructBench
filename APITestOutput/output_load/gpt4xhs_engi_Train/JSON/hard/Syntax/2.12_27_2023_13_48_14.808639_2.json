Similarly, commas must be used to separate elements and key-value pairs appropriately, without any trailing commas at the end of lists or objects.\n\n3. **Unquoted or Improperly Quoted Keys/Strings**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes `\"\"`. Single quotes `''` are not valid, nor are unquoted keys or string values.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, objects, booleans, and null. Inserting an unsupported data type or incorrectly formatting a value (like adding quotes around numbers) can cause errors.\n\n5. **Nested Objects/Arrays Complexity**: Deeply nested objects or arrays can sometimes be confusing and might lead to missing or extra brackets or commas.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: Any deviation from the JSON format specification, such as missing colons `:` between keys and values, or using an equals sign `=` instead, will result in a structural error.\n\n7. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments.
