Extra commas: In several places, there are commas that do not separate key-value pairs or array elements, and they are followed by another set of curly braces without a key, which is incorrect.\n\n2. Unmatched brackets and braces: There are several places where curly braces `{}` and square brackets `[]` are not correctly matched or closed.
