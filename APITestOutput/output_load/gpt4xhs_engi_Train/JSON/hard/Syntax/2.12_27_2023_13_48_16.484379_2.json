Unquoted strings are a common mistake.\n\n3. **Trailing Commas**: JSON does not allow trailing commas at the end of lists or objects, which is a common mistake for those used to languages that allow this.\n\n4. **Incorrect Brackets**: Using the wrong type of bracket, such as a square bracket instead of a curly bracket, can lead to structural errors.\n\n5. **Mismatched Bracket Pairing**: Every opening bracket (whether curly `{` or square `[`) must be paired with a matching closing bracket.\n\n6. **Data Types Issues**: JSON supports specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). Mistyping these or using unsupported data types will result in errors.\n\n7. **Nested Structures**: Errors can occur in nested objects or arrays if the hierarchy is not maintained correctly.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: JSON should be encoded in UTF-8; other encodings can lead to problems with parsing special characters.\n\n9. **Single Quotes**: JSON requires double quotes for strings; single quotes are not valid.\n\n10. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, and any attempt to include them will result in a structural error.\n\nAfter identifying these potential issues, I can now proceed to analyze the given JSON file for structural errors when it is provided."
