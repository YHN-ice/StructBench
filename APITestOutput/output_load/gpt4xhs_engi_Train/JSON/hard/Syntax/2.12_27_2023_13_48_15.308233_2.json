        "True\n\nThe provided JSON structure contains multiple errors. Here are the issues I spotted:\n\n1. There are missing commas between objects in arrays. For instance, after the object with `\"id\":\"cb\"`, a comma is missing before the next object with `\"id\":\"db\"`.\n2. Similarly, after the object with `\"id\":\"fb\"`, a comma is missing before the next object with `\"id\":\"gb\"`.\n3. Also, after the object with `\"id\":\"jb\"`, a comma is missing before the next object with `\"id\":\"kb\"`.\n4. After the object with `\"id\":\"mb\"`, a comma is missing before the next object with `\"id\":\"nb\"`.\n5.
