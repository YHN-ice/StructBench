Single quotes or unquoted keys can cause errors.\n3. **Data Type Issues**: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). An invalid data type or improper formatting can result in an error.\n4. **Braces and Brackets Mismatch**: Opening and closing curly braces `{}` must be matched properly for objects, and square brackets `[]` for arrays. Unmatched or incorrectly nested braces and brackets can lead to errors.\n5. **Trailing Commas**: Although some parsers allow it, a trailing comma after the last element in an array or object is not valid in JSON.\n6. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.
