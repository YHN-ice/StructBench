Unquoted keys: In JSON, keys must always be strings and therefore should be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Incorrect quotes: JSON requires double quotes for strings. Single quotes are not valid.\n\n4. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages which allow trailing commas in arrays and objects, JSON does not allow trailing commas.\n\n5. Nested errors: When dealing with nested objects or arrays, errors can be more difficult to spot.\n\n6. Data type issues: JSON only supports certain data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). If a value doesn't fit into these types or if there's a syntax error related to data types (e.g., non-quoted strings), it will result in an error.\n\n7.

Syntax consistency: Inconsistencies in the use of brackets for arrays or braces for objects can lead to errors.\n\n9.
