Assigning an incorrect data type to a value could cause an error.\n\n3. **Incorrect Nesting**: Objects and arrays can be nested within each other, but they need to be properly opened and closed with curly braces `{}` for objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays.\n\n4. **Unescaped Characters**: In JSON strings, certain characters like double quotes, backslashes, and control characters must be escaped with a backslash (`\\`).\n\n5. **Encoding Problems**: JSON is typically UTF-8 encoded.
