It might be challenging to traverse these nested structures, especially if they are not uniformly structured.\n\n2. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be challenging to process the entire file efficiently, as it could require significant memory or computational resources.\n\n3. **Mixed Data Types**: Within nested JSON objects, there may be a mix of types including lists, dicts, strings, numbers, booleans, and nulls. Identifying objects without lists or dicts requires careful inspection of each value.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Defining \"Most Deeply Nested\"**: Depending on the structure of the JSON, there could be multiple paths to reach the deepest level. We would need to define what constitutes the \"most deeply nested\" in cases where there are multiple paths of the same depth.\n\n5. **Circular References**: Although rare and generally considered bad practice, JSON structures could theoretically contain circular references (which is more common in other data formats like YAML). This would create an infinite loop if not handled correctly.\n\n6. **Encoding and Format Issues**: The JSON file might have encoding issues or may not strictly adhere to the JSON format, which can lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Keeping Track of the Paths**: While traversing the JSON object, it is necessary to keep track of the paths taken to ensure that the \"most deeply nested object\" is indeed the deepest according to the structure.\n\n8. **Output Format**: The requirement is to output excerpts as they appear in the JSON file. This means that the parser would need to preserve the formatting and structure when providing these excerpts.\n\nOnce we encounter these challenges, we would need strategies such as recursive functions, stack-based iterative parsing, memory management techniques, and error handling mechanisms to overcome them and accurately identify the most deeply nested objects in the JSON file."
