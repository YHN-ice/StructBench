It can be difficult to traverse these structures programmatically to determine the depth of nesting.\n\n2. **Identifying the Type of Values**: Since the requirement is to find objects that do not contain lists or dicts as their values, one needs to distinguish between different types of values (strings, numbers, booleans, null, lists, and dicts) and handle them accordingly.\n\n3. **Large File Size**: If the JSON file is particularly large, it may be challenging to parse the file without running into memory issues or long processing times.\n\n4. **Multiple Occurrences**: There may be multiple objects that meet the criteria of being the most deeply nested. Each occurrence needs to be identified and listed separately.\n\n5. **Equal Depth Handling**: There might be various paths in a JSON object that reach the same depth level but are not part of the same object path. Deciding how to handle these equally deep paths can be complex.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Requirements**: The task description might be interpreted differently. For example, what constitutes an \"object\" in this context could vary – whether it is any key-value pair or specifically a dictionary-like structure without further nested objects or arrays.\n\n7. **Formatting and Output**: Preserving the formatting of the JSON for the output (indentation, braces, etc.) while extracting the most deeply nested objects can be challenging as well.\n\n8. **Performance Optimization**: Implementing an efficient algorithm to traverse the JSON structure without unnecessary repetitions or backtracking can be non-trivial, especially for deeply nested or very large JSON files.\n\n9. **Incomplete or Malformed JSON**: If the input JSON file is incomplete or improperly formatted, parsing it could result in errors that need to be handled.\n\n10. **Tool Limitations**: The tools or libraries used to parse the JSON must be capable of handling all aspects of the JSON format and provide the necessary functionality to determine depth and content type.\n\nOnce the JSON file is provided, I will apply an appropriate strategy to parse it and extract the requested information while keeping these potential difficulties in mind."
