Identifying objects that do not contain other lists or dictionaries while traversing the structure can be tricky.\n\n3. **Recursive Structures**: If the JSON contains recursive structures, where an object might indirectly contain itself, it could create an infinite loop if not handled properly.\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it could consume a significant amount of memory and CPU time to parse and analyze the structure, potentially leading to performance issues.\n\n5. **Multiple Paths**: There could be multiple paths to reach the same depth, which might require keeping track of all such paths to ensure that none are missed.\n\n6. **Identical Objects at Different Depths**: Identical objects might appear at different depths in the JSON structure, which could require additional logic to handle them correctly based on their nesting level rather than their content.\n\n7. **Data Integrity**: The JSON file might have errors or might not be well-formed, which can cause issues during parsing.\n\n8. **Encoding and Special Characters**: Handling of special characters and encoding might need to be considered to ensure that the content is read and represented correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust algorithm for traversing the JSON structure is needed.
