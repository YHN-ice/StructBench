When searching for deeply nested objects, we must consider both types and correctly handle the depth of nesting in both.\n\n3. **Multiple Deeply Nested Objects**: There could be multiple objects that are deeply nested to the same level. The parser should be able to identify all such occurrences.\n\n4. **Data Types**: A deeply nested object should not contain further lists or dictionaries as values, so the parser must differentiate between these and primitive data types like strings, numbers, booleans, and null.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is particularly large, it could present performance issues. Efficient algorithms and perhaps streaming of the file content might be necessary.\n\n6. **Variably Formatted JSON**: The JSON could be minified (without unnecessary whitespace), pretty-printed, or inconsistently formatted, which can affect the ease of parsing.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: JSON files are typically UTF-8 encoded, but they could be in other encodings as well. Ensuring correct handling of the file encoding is important to avoid errors.\n\nOnce you provide me with the JSON file or its contents, I will parse it and attempt to identify the most deeply nested objects that do not contain other lists or dictionaries as their values."
