When parsing a JSON file to find the most deeply nested objects that have no list or dictionary as a value, several difficulties and obstacles might arise:\n\n1. **Complex Nesting Structures**: JSON objects can contain multiple levels of nested dictionaries and lists, which can make it challenging to traverse and identify the deepest level. \n\n2. **Variably Nested Elements**: Different branches of the JSON structure could be nested to varying degrees, meaning we have to compare depths across different parts of the JSON.\n\n3. **Mixed Types**: Within the same level of nesting, there could be a mixture of types (lists, dictionaries, strings, numbers, booleans, etc.), and distinguishing between them is essential since we're only interested in objects without list or dict types.\n\n4. **Recursion Handling**: To navigate deeply nested structures, recursion might be necessary, and managing the recursive state correctly to identify the deepest elements is a common challenge.\n\n5. **Identifying End Nodes**: We need to differentiate between objects that are containers for other objects (non-terminal nodes) and those that are the actual end nodes (terminal nodes with no further nested structures).\n\n6. **Output Formatting**: Extracting the nested objects without altering their structure or content, and presenting them in the required format can be challenging, especially if the JSON has special characters, unicode, or requires escaping.\n\n7. **Large Files and Performance**: If the JSON file is very large, it could lead to performance issues when parsing it. Efficient algorithms and possibly streaming the JSON content may be necessary.\n\n8. **Invalid JSON Format**: The parser needs to handle cases where the input JSON might be malformed or invalid.\n\nTo address these challenges, a JSON parsing algorithm would typically involve a depth-first search through the object, tracking the depth of each object and type-checking to ensure that objects do not contain further nested lists or dictionaries. Upon reaching terminal nodes (deepest objects without further nesting), these would be collected and outputted in the specified format."
