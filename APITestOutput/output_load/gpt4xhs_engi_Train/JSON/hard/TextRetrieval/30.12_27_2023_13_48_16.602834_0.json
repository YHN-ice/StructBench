The object with id 'd' could be nested within an array or another object, requiring careful parsing to handle these correctly.\n\n4. **Non-Unique Identifiers**: If the id 'd' is not unique within the file, there might be multiple objects with the same id, which requires knowing which one to retrieve or handling multiple instances.\n\n5. **Encoding and Escaping**: Special characters in strings need to be handled correctly according to JSON encoding rules.\n\n6. **Errors in JSON**: The file might contain syntax errors or may not be properly formatted as valid JSON, which could lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: If data is missing or incomplete, this would make it difficult to provide a complete and accurate response.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Requirements**: The term \"excerpt\" needs clarification.
