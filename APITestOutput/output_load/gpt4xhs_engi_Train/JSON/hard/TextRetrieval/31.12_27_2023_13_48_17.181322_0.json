If the parser expects an ID to be a string but it's actually a number (or vice versa), this may lead to issues when searching for the object.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors in JSON**: If the JSON file has syntax errors, it might not be parseable, which would prevent us from retrieving any data from it.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the file is not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), there might be issues reading and interpreting some of the content.\n\n7. **Access Permissions**: The parser might have issues accessing the file due to insufficient permissions or if the file is located in a restricted directory.\n\n8. **Software Limitations**: The capabilities of the JSON parser itself may impose limitations, such as maximum file size, depth of nesting that can be handled, etc.\n\nOnce I have access to the actual JSON file, I’ll be able to handle these issues accordingly and retrieve the object with the specified ID.
