This means we have to ensure that all values within an object are of primitive types (like strings, numbers, booleans, or `null`).\n\n3. **Diverse Value Types**: JSON objects can contain values of various types, including nested objects. Each value must be checked to see if it is a list or a dictionary or a terminal value.\n\n4. **Multiple Occurrences**: There may be multiple objects that meet the criteria for being the \"most deeply nested.\" It's important to identify all such occurrences.\n\n5. **Data Volume**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be difficult to manually parse through the entire structure to determine the most deeply nested objects.\n\n6. **Performance and Optimization**: Depending on the size and complexity of the JSON file, performance could be a concern.

Is it the object with the highest level of nesting, or is it any object at the greatest depth level?\n\n8. **Reading and Output Formatting**: Ensuring that the extracted content is presented correctly with appropriate formatting as it appears in the JSON file can be challenging especially when maintaining nested structures in the output.\n\nOnce we have the JSON file, we can use an algorithm to parse the file, keep track of the current depth, and store objects that are candidates for being the most deeply nested ones while ensuring none of their values are of type list or dict.
