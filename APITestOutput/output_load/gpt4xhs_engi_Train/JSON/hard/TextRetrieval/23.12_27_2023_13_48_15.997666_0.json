Some of these challenges include:\n\n1. **Invalid JSON Format**: If the JSON file contains syntax errors or is not properly formatted, it might be difficult to parse and extract the required data.\n\n2. **Large File Size**: Large JSON files can be resource-intensive to parse, leading to long processing times or even causing memory issues.\n\n3. **Nested Structures**: JSON files can contain nested arrays and objects, which might require recursive parsing or complex logic to navigate and extract the desired information.\n\n4. **Ambiguity or Inconsistencies**: If the object identifiers are not unique, or if the structure of the JSON is inconsistent, finding the correct object may be challenging.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: Text encoding problems can corrupt the content when reading from the file, making it difficult to parse correctly.\n\n6. **Data Types and Validation**: Ensuring that extracted data matches the expected type (e.g., string, number, boolean) and adheres to any schema constraints can be an issue.\n\n7. **Multiple Objects with the Same ID**: If there are multiple objects with the same 'id', additional context or criteria may be needed to determine which object is being referred to.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, it's important to have robust error handling, use efficient parsing algorithms, and possibly employ a schema or structure definition to validate the JSON content.\n\nNow, you can provide me with the JSON file or its content, and I will parse it to answer your question regarding the object with id 'l'."
