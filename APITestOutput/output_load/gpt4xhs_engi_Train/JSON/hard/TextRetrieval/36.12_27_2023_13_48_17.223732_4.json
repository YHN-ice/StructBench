Identifying all of the deepest branches might require keeping track of multiple paths simultaneously.\n\n4. **Large Files and Performance**: If the JSON file is large, performance can become an issue. Efficiently parsing and keeping track of the nesting structure without excessive resource usage would be important.\n\n5. **Identifying Excerpts**: Once the most deeply nested objects are found, extracting exact excerpts as they appear in the file could be difficult if the parser does not retain formatting or location information.\n\n6. **Multiple Deepest Objects**: There can be more than one object that qualifies as the \"most deeply nested,\" which requires handling multiple answers.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Definition**: It must be clear what constitutes an object that has no list or dict as a value. For instance, if an object contains strings, numbers, or nulls, it must be considered, but any object that contains an array or another object should not.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a parser would need to carefully traverse the JSON structure, keeping track of nesting levels and the types of values encountered, and then correctly extract and format the relevant excerpts to present as the answer."
