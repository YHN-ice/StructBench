        "To extract the most deeply nested objects that do not contain any further lists or dictionaries as values, we can define a recursive function to traverse the JSON structure and collect these objects. Below is the pseudo-code for the process:\n\n1. Define a function `find_deepest_objects` that takes an object (a dictionary in Python terms) as a parameter along with the current depth level.\n2. Initialize a global variable `deepest_objects` to keep track of the deepest objects found so far, and another global variable `max_depth` to keep track of the maximum depth encountered.\n3. The function should iterate over the key-value pairs in the provided object.\n4. For each value:\n   - If the value is a list, recursively call `find_deepest_objects` for each dictionary within the list, incrementing the depth level.\n   - If the value is a dictionary, recursively call `find_deepest_objects` on that dictionary, incrementing the depth level.\n   - If the value is neither a list nor a dictionary (i.e., it's a primitive data type), continue checking other key-value pairs.\n5. If an object has no key with a list or dictionary as a value (all values are primitive data types), compare its depth level with `max_depth`.\n   - If the depth level is higher than `max_depth`, clear `deepest_objects` and update `max_depth` to this new maximum depth, then add the current object to `deepest_objects`.\n   - If the depth level is equal to `max_depth`, simply add the current object to `deepest_objects`.\n6.
