For example, if the keys are not consistently named or if there are syntax errors.\n\n4. **Multiple Objects with Same ID:** If there are multiple objects with the same id 'z', determining which one to provide as the answer could be confusing without additional context.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Keys:** If the key 'id' is used for different purposes in different parts of the JSON structure or if there are nested objects that also contain an 'id' key, it may be unclear which 'id' is being referred to.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues:** Character encoding issues could make it hard to read or interpret certain parts of the JSON file correctly.\n\n7. **External References:** The JSON file might reference external files or URLs for additional data, which may not be readily available during parsing.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, having the right tools (such as a JSON parser library) and understanding the structure of the JSON file in advance can greatly assist in extracting the correct information efficiently.
