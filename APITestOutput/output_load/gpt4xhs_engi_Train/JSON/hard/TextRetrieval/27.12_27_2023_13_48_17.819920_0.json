It may also not be properly formatted as valid JSON.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Request**: The request for an \"excerpt\" could be ambiguous if the object with id 'x' contains a lot of data. Determining what constitutes an \"excerpt\" might require further clarification.\n\n7. **Data Types**: JSON supports several data types such as number, string, boolean, null, object, and array.
