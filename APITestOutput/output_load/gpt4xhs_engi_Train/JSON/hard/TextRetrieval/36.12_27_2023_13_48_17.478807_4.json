Identifying the most deeply nested objects requires a recursive approach or a well-thought-out iterative process to traverse through all the levels properly.\n\n2. **Large Size of JSON File**: If the JSON file is very large, it can be challenging to process the entire file without efficient memory management. This could slow down the parsing process or even cause it to fail if not handled properly.\n\n3. **Variations in Data Types**: The values within the JSON objects could be of various types (string, number, object, array, boolean, null). We need to handle these data types appropriately to avoid errors during parsing.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Data Structures**: The structure of the JSON might not be uniform throughout, which can complicate the parsing logic. For example, some objects may be nested within arrays while others are nested within other objects.\n\n5. **Encoding and Format Issues**: The file encoding might not be standard UTF-8, or there could be format issues such as missing commas or brackets that result in invalid JSON.\n\n6. **Performance Considerations**: Depending on the approach used to parse and search the JSON (e.g., loading the entire file into memory versus streaming it), performance can be significantly impacted, especially for large files.\n\n7. **Extracting Relevant Parts**: Once the most deeply nested objects are found, they need to be extracted in a way that preserves their structure and formatting so they can be presented as excerpts.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties and obstacles, it's important to use a robust JSON parsing library or tool, set up proper error handling, ensure efficient memory usage, and have a clear strategy for traversing and extracting the required data from the JSON structure."
