Nesting complexity: The value \"c\" might be deeply nested within objects and arrays, requiring a clear understanding of the JSON structure to navigate to the correct key or index.\n\n2. Array indexes vs. Object keys: JSON can contain both arrays (accessed by index) and objects (accessed by key). Distinguishing between them and using the correct access method is crucial.\n\n3. Similar keys: If the JSON has multiple keys with the same name at different levels or within different branches, identifying the correct path to \"c\" can be challenging.\n\n4. Dynamic structure: If the JSON structure isn't consistent (e.g., varying keys, optional fields), it might be hard to provide a generic access path that works for all possible variations of the file.\n\n5. Case sensitivity: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so \"C\" and \"c\" would be considered different keys. Care must be taken to use the correct case when accessing keys.\n\n6. Data types: Ensuring that the data type of the value is what's expected (e.g., string, number, object) is necessary to prevent errors in processing the data.\n\n7. Error handling: Proper error handling is important to deal with cases where the path to \"c\" may not exist due to an unexpected JSON structure or if the file contains syntax errors.\n\n8. Syntax correctness: The syntax used to access values must follow the conventions for the language or tool being used for parsing. For example, different programming languages might have slightly different syntax for accessing object properties or array elements.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these obstacles will be essential for accurately parsing the JSON file and retrieving the value \"c\"."
