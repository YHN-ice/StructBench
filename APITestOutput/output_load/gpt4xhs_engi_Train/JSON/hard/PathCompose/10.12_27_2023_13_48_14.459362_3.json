Keys with Special Characters: Keys in JSON objects might contain spaces, hyphens, or other special characters that require special handling, such as using bracket notation instead of dot notation to access the values.\n\n3. Ambiguity in Access Path: If the instructions are not clear or if the JSON structure has multiple paths leading to similar keys, it may be challenging to determine the correct access path without additional context.\n\n4. Dynamic Structures: If the structure of the JSON is dynamic and can change, providing a static access path might not be reliable.\n\n5. Large Files: For very large JSON files, performance can become an issue, and efficient parsing strategies may be needed to access the desired value without significant delays.\n\n6. Syntax Errors: The JSON file might have syntax errors such as missing commas or brackets, extra trailing commas, or incorrectly formatted data, which would prevent proper parsing.\n\n7. Encoding Issues: Character encoding issues might arise if the JSON file contains non-standard characters or has been saved with an incorrect encoding.\n\n8. Data Types: Ensuring that the accessed value is of the expected data type (string, number, array, object, etc.) is important and sometimes requires additional checks or conversions.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a careful examination of the JSON structure is required along with potential error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure robust parsing."
