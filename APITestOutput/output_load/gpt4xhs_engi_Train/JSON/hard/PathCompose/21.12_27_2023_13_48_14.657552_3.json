Dynamic structures: The structure of the JSON may not be fixed, meaning that the path to \"n\" could vary depending on the data which makes automation challenging without a consistent schema.\n\n5. Type checking: JSON supports different types (e.g., object, array, string, number, boolean, null), so it's essential to ensure that each level of access corresponds to the correct type (e.g., using an index to access an array element or a key to access an object's property).\n\n6. Case sensitivity: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so accessing \"n\" would require matching the exact case used in the JSON file.\n\n7. Handling missing or optional data: If \"n\" is optional or might be missing from some entries, the code needs to handle these cases gracefully without throwing errors.\n\n8. Syntax errors in JSON: Malformed JSON with missing brackets, commas, or quotes can prevent successful parsing of the file.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, care must be taken to ensure that the path to the desired value is correct and that any code written to access the value is robust against variations in the JSON structure."
