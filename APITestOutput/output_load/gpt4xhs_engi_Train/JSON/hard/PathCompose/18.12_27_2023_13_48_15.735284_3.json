Nested Structures: JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays. I need to navigate through the correct hierarchy of objects and arrays to access the desired value.\n\n2. Correct Keys: Each value in a JSON object is associated with a key. I must know the correct keys to use at each level of the hierarchy to reach the target value.\n\n3. Array Indices: If the value is within an array, I'll need to know the correct index to use. Indices are zero-based, so I must be careful to use the right index number.\n\n4. Dynamic Structure: If the structure of the JSON file is not consistent, it could be more challenging to provide a one-size-fits-all access path. The path I give based on one instance of the JSON might not work for another if the structure changes.\n\n5. Type Errors: JSON objects and arrays are different types, and trying to access an array like an object (using keys) or an object like an array (using indices) will result in an error.\n\n6. Syntactical Correctness: When describing the access path, I need to use the correct syntax, including object dot-notation or bracket notation where appropriate.\n\n7.
