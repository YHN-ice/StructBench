Each level of nesting requires proper navigation through keys and indices.\n\n2. **Keys with Similar Names**: JSON objects might have keys with similar or identical names but located at different levels of the hierarchy, which can be confusing when trying to access the correct key.\n\n3. **Dynamic Structures**: The structure of a JSON file could be dynamic, meaning that the keys and their order might change from one instance to another. This can make it challenging to write a generic access pattern.\n\n4. **Type Errors**: Accessing values in a JSON object requires knowing whether the value associated with a key is another object, an array, or a primitive value. Mistaking an object for an array, or vice versa, can result in errors.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so \"Key\" and \"key\" would be considered different. Care must be taken to use the correct case when accessing values.\n\n6. **Incorrect Path**: Giving an incorrect path by skipping a level or using the wrong key/index at any level will lead to either an error or accessing the wrong value.\n\n7. **Data Integrity**: If the JSON file is not well-formed or has missing data, it can lead to errors when trying to parse it or access certain values.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues is crucial when parsing and accessing data within a JSON file. Now, if you provide the JSON input, I can show you how to access the value \"wy\" by overcoming these obstacles."
