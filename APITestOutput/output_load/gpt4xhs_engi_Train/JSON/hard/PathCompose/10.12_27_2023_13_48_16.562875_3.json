If the key names are not known or if there's a typo in the key, it would lead to an incorrect path or a failure to retrieve the value.\n\n3. **Arrays**: If the value is within an array, you need to know the correct index to access it. Indices are zero-based, and using an incorrect index can result in an error, or retrieving the wrong element.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the accessed value is of the expected data type is important. For example, if \"m\" is expected to be a string but is actually a number or an object, additional parsing or type conversion may be necessary.\n\n5. **Dynamic Structure**: If the structure of the JSON file is dynamic and can change, it may be necessary to implement checks or search algorithms to dynamically find the key \"m\".\n\n6. **Large JSON Files**: For very large JSON files, memory limitations and performance considerations may come into play when parsing and accessing data.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is important to gracefully handle cases where the key does not exist or the JSON is malformed.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: JSON files should be UTF-8 encoded.
