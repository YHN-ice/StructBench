Understanding the depth of nesting and the correct path is essential to access the desired value.\n\n2. **Correct Data Types:** JSON supports different data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. It’s important to know the type of each element to access it correctly.\n\n3. **Array Indexing:** If the value is part of an array, one needs to know the correct index to access it. Array indexes start at 0, so it's easy to make off-by-one errors.\n\n4. **Similar Keys:** If there are keys with similar names or if the keys are case-sensitive, it might lead to confusion.\n\n5. **Dynamic Structures:** If the structure of the JSON is not known beforehand or if it changes dynamically, it might be challenging to provide a generic solution.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors:** While traversing the JSON object, it’s crucial to get the syntax right. For example, using brackets instead of dots for object properties or vice versa can lead to errors.\n\n7. **Missing Keys:** The key for the desired value might not exist or might be misspelled, which would lead to returning undefined or an error.\n\n8. **Large Files:** If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to manually find the correct path to the desired value.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one needs to carefully analyze the JSON structure, ensure correct syntax based on the types of elements (objects or arrays), and verify that the keys and indexes used are accurate."
