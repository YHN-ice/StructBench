Therefore, it is important to use the exact casing of the keys as they appear in the JSON file.\n\n7. **Data Integrity Issues**: The JSON file could be malformed or contain errors which would prevent proper parsing and interpretation of the data.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file is encoded in a way that is not supported by the parser or if there are special characters that are not properly escaped, it might lead to incorrect parsing results.\n\nDespite these potential challenges, once the JSON structure is understood and if the data is correctly formatted, accessing a value like \"gy\" should be straightforward using the appropriate object property and array index accessors."
