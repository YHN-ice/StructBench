When parsing a JSON file to access a specific value, several potential difficulties and obstacles might arise, including:\n\n1. **Nested Structures**: JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays, which can make navigating to the correct key or index more challenging.\n\n2. **Keys with Similar Names**: If the JSON contains keys with similar or identical names at different nesting levels, it can be tricky to specify the correct path.\n\n3. **Arrays vs. Objects**: Distinguishing between objects (which use keys) and arrays (which use indices) is crucial for accessing elements correctly.\n\n4. **Variable Data Types**: JSON values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or nulls.
