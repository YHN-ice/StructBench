In such cases, static access paths may not always work.\n\n5. **Type Checking**: JSON supports different types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, null), so ensuring that you are accessing the correct type (object or array) before using a key or index is important to prevent errors.\n\n6. **Error Handling**: There is a need for error handling in case the key or index does not exist, which could lead to undefined values or runtime errors.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file has encoding issues or special characters in key names, it might not be parsed correctly, leading to difficulties in accessing specific values.\n\n8. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be slow to parse or lead to memory issues, which can impede the processing and accessing of specific values within it.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, it's essential to understand the structure of the JSON data, use proper error handling, and ensure that the parsing process accounts for the dynamic nature of JSON objects and arrays."
