Zero-based indexing might cause off-by-one errors if not handled carefully.\n\n4. **Data types**: JSON supports different data types like numbers, strings, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Ensuring the correct type is accessed is essential.\n\n5. **Large files**: A large JSON file could make it difficult to find the correct path due to its size and complexity.\n\n6. **Special characters**: Keys might contain special characters or spaces, requiring bracket notation instead of dot notation for access.\n\n7. **Case sensitivity**: JSON keys are case sensitive, so it's important to match the case exactly when accessing a value.\n\n8. **Dynamic JSON structure**: If the structure of the JSON is dynamic and changes frequently, it can be difficult to write a reliable path to access a specific value.\n\n9. **Typos and human error**: Simple typos or mistakes in the path can lead to wrong values being accessed or errors being thrown.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, you must carefully examine the JSON structure, ensure correct indexing, use the right key names with proper case sensitivity, and handle any special characters appropriately."
