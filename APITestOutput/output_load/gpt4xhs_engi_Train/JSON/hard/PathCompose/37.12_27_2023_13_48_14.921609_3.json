When an array is encountered, you need to know the index of the element you want to access, which might not be straightforward if you don't know the array's contents or if the array is dynamically generated.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports different data types, such as strings, numbers, objects, and arrays. Ensuring that you access the correct type (e.g., object vs. array) is crucial for the correct path.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to visually parse and find the correct key-value pairs without the aid of software tools.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: JSON is strict in its syntax. Missing or extra commas, quotes, or brackets can lead to parsing errors, which would prevent access to any data.\n\n7. **Encoding**: If the JSON file uses a character encoding that's not properly handled by the parser, there could be issues reading the file.\n\n8. **Access Permissions**: Depending on where and how the JSON file is stored, there may be permission issues that prevent accessing or reading the file.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, it's important to approach parsing a JSON file methodically, ensuring understanding of its structure and using appropriate tools to navigate it.
