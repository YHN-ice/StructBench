Nested Structures: If the JSON file has deeply nested objects or arrays, it can be challenging to construct the correct path to the desired value.\n\n2. Array Indexing: When dealing with arrays within the JSON structure, it's important to know the correct index to access the desired element, which can be challenging if the arrays are large or if their contents are dynamic.\n\n3. Key Names: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so it's important to use the exact key name, including the correct case, to access the associated value.\n\n4. Special Characters: If keys contain special characters or spaces, they might need to be accessed using bracket notation instead of dot notation, which requires the key to be specified as a string.\n\n5. Data Type Issues: It's important to know the data type of the elements being accessed (e.g., whether they are objects, arrays, strings, numbers, etc.) to ensure that the correct access method is used.\n\n6.
