Misinterpreting the data type of the key or value could lead to incorrect access paths.\n\n6. **Large Files and Performance**: For very large JSON files, processing and parsing can be resource-intensive, and searching through the data might take significant time.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: Simple typos or syntax errors in the access path (such as missing quotes around a string key or forgetting a closing bracket) can result in failed attempts to access the desired value.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file includes special characters or is encoded in a non-standard way, it could cause issues with parsing and accessing data.\n\n9. **Updates to Data Structure**: If the structure of the JSON file changes (for example, through an update to an API's response format), previous access paths may become invalid.\n\nWithout having seen the actual JSON input file yet, these are general challenges that might be encountered when trying to access a specific value within a JSON structure.
