Both types should be identified correctly.\n\n4. **File Path Complexity**: Image paths might be absolute or relative, and could include complex directory structures that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n5. **Markup Variability**: The ORG markup used to include images might vary and could include additional attributes or markup elements that are not part of the file name.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Identifying which file extensions correspond to images (e.g., jpg, png, gif) as opposed to other file types will be essential in filtering out non-image files.\n\n7. **Encoding and Special Characters**: File names may include special characters or spaces that are encoded in the ORG file, which will need to be decoded to get the correct file name.\n\n8. **Hidden or Commented Links**: There might be image links that are commented out or otherwise hidden in the document that should not be extracted.\n\nOnce we have the input ORG file, we can apply the necessary parsing logic to extract the image file names while considering these potential issues."
