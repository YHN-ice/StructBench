However, there might be variations or inconsistencies in formatting that could make it difficult to identify bold text reliably.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, such as italic, underlined, or strike-through text. This could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escape characters**: If asterisks are used in the text but not meant to indicate bold formatting (e.g., in a mathematical context), they might be escaped with a backslash. Distinguishing between actual bold formatting and escaped characters will be important.\n\n4. **Line breaks within bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which may require handling line breaks properly to ensure that the entire bold text is extracted as a single unit.\n\n5. **Non-text content**: The ORG file might contain non-text content such as links, code blocks, or special blocks that could affect how bold text is parsed.\n\n6. **Special ORG mode properties**: ORG files might contain special properties or settings that change the way text is interpreted by an ORG parser, and these would need to be taken into account.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll be able to determine which of these potential issues are present and will need to be addressed in order to accurately extract the bold text."
