It's important to differentiate between them and handle each type correctly.\n\n3. **Hidden or Commented Links**: Sometimes, image links might be commented out or included in a way that they are not meant to be parsed (inside code blocks or comments). The parser needs to ignore these.\n\n4. **Non-Image File Links**: The file might also include links to non-image files, so the parser has to correctly identify and extract only image file links.\n\n5. **Complex Markup**: The image link might be part of a more complex markup (e.g., embedded within tables, lists, or other structural elements of the ORG file).\n\n6. **Multiple File Types**: There could be multiple image file types (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser should be ready to extract all of these.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I will apply parsing strategies to overcome these obstacles and extract the names of all included image files accurately."
