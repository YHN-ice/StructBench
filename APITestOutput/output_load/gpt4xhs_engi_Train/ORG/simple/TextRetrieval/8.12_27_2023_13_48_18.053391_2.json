We need to differentiate between these cases.\n\n5. **Non-Image File Links**: The file might contain links to non-image files as well, so we need to ensure that we are only extracting the image file links.\n\n6. **Textual Noise**: There may be text or code blocks surrounding the image links that are not part of the actual link. We must parse the content properly to extract only the filenames.\n\n7. **ORG File Syntax Conventions**: If there are specific syntax conventions for images in ORG files, we need to be aware of them to accurately identify image links.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There could be multiple image links on a single line, and we need to be able to extract each one individually.\n\n9. **Hidden or Commented Image Links**: Some image links might be commented out or otherwise hidden from a simple text extraction perspective.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll apply appropriate parsing strategies to overcome these obstacles and extract the filenames of all included images."
