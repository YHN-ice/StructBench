Typically, it is denoted by asterisks (e.g., `*bold*`), but variations or mistakes in formatting may exist.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold text might be part of a larger line, which includes other types of formatting or plain text. This makes it necessary to parse the line carefully to extract only the bold parts.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used in the text might not always denote bold formatting; they could be escaped or used for other purposes, such as lists or sections. We would need to differentiate between actual formatting and literal asterisks.\n\n4. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italic or underlined text. The parser needs to handle such cases without losing context.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser should be able to handle and extract it correctly.\n\n6. **File Structure and Metadata**: ORG files can contain various structural elements like headers, lists, tables, etc., which might complicate the parsing process.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in creating a more robust parser for extracting bold texts from an ORG file. Once I see the input file, I will be able to parse the content accordingly."
