The parser needs to recognize all variations.\n\n2. **File path variations**: Images might be linked with absolute or relative paths, and the file names might include spaces, special characters, or subdirectory paths, which all need to be correctly identified.\n\n3. **Non-image file links**: The ORG file might contain links to non-image files, so it's necessary to filter out only those that are images based on file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.).\n\n4. **Markup complexity**: There might be complex markup around the image links, including captions, attributes, or other nested markup that needs to be parsed correctly to isolate the image file names.\n\n5. **Embedded vs. linked images**: Some images might not be linked but rather embedded in the file in a base64 format or similar, which would be more challenging to extract as file names.\n\n6. **External links**: The document might include links to external images hosted online, which are not actual \"files\" within the document but URLs. Depending on the requirement, you might need to include or exclude these.\n\n7. **Multiple occurrences**: An image might be referenced multiple times throughout the document. It needs to be decided whether to list each occurrence or unique image names.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, it's important to carefully parse the ORG file while considering the syntax used for image inclusion and filtering out the actual image file names accordingly."
