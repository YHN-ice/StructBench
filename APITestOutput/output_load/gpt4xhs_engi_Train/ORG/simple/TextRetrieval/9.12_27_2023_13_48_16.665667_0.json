For example, bold text might be enclosed by a single asterisk on each side (*bold*) or multiple asterisks (e.g., **bold**). Differentiating between headings (which also use asterisks) and bold text might be tricky.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold text can appear inline with other text, which can make it difficult to extract just the bold parts without accidentally including adjacent non-bold text.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italicized text or code blocks, which complicates the parsing logic.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Special characters like backslashes or additional asterisks within the bold text itself can alter the expected formatting, leading to incorrect extractions.\n\n5. **Escape Sequences**: Some ORG files use escape sequences to prevent formatting from being applied (e.g., \\*not bold\\*). These need to be correctly identified to avoid false positives.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it can be challenging to extract it completely if the parser is only looking at one line at a time.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser must be able to handle all the above scenarios effectively. It might require a combination of regex patterns and context-aware parsing to distinguish between different uses of asterisks and other formatting indicators."
