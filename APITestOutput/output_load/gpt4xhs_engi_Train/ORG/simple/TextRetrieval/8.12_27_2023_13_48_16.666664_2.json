Handling different path structures effectively is necessary.\n\n3. **Link Formatting**: Users might add additional attributes or descriptions to links that could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Embedded Images vs. Linked Images**: Images can be embedded directly into the ORG file or linked from external sources. Ensuring we're only extracting actual file names rather than URLs will be important.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Not all links with file extensions are images; filtering out non-image files (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`) while ensuring all image formats (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.) are captured is crucial.\n\n6. **File Name Special Characters**: File names can contain special characters that could affect parsing, such as spaces, parentheses, or unicode characters.\n\n7. **Image References within Code Blocks**: Sometimes, code blocks might contain text that resembles image links but aren't actual images included in the document.\n\n8. **Commented or Inactive Links**: Image links might be commented out or marked as inactive, and deciding whether to include these in the extraction could be a challenge.\n\nTo handle these issues, a thorough understanding of the ORG file syntax for images and robust parsing rules will be necessary to correctly identify and extract the image file names."
