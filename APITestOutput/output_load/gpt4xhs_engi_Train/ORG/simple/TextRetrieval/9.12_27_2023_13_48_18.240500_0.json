We need to differentiate between these uses.\n\n2. **Multiple Uses of Asterisks**: Asterisks in an ORG file may be used for several purposes, such as headlines, list items, and different emphasis levels (bold, italic, bold-italic). Parsing the context of each asterisk is necessary.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested within other formatting elements (like lists, italics, or code blocks), which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Handling special characters within bold text or escape sequences that might alter the parsing logic.\n\n5. **False Positives**: There might be asterisks that are part of a sentence and not meant for bold formatting, like in mathematical expressions or as bullet points.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: The ORG file might have inconsistent formatting where the bold syntax is not properly applied, such as missing closing asterisks.\n\n7. **Line Breaks and White Spaces**: Handling line breaks within bold text and white spaces that might be present around the asterisks.\n\nNow, please provide the ORG file content to start the extraction of bold texts."
