Distinguishing between these uses might be challenging.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underlined, or code blocks, which may complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Multiline Bold Text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it could be difficult to correctly identify and extract the whole segment.\n\n4. **Ambiguous Formatting**: Inconsistent use of formatting markers (for example, missing a closing asterisk) might make it difficult to find the end of the bold text.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: Special characters within bold sections, such as escaped asterisks or other markup symbols, could interfere with the correct identification of bold text.\n\n6. **File Encoding and Line Endings**: File encoding or line endings might affect the parsing process, particularly if the ORG file was created on a different operating system.\n\n7. **Version Differences**: The ORG format might have evolved over time, so older or newer ORG files might use slightly different syntax for bold text or other features.\n\nTo proceed accurately, the parser must be able to handle these cases and correctly identify the bold text according to the ORG file syntax and conventions."
