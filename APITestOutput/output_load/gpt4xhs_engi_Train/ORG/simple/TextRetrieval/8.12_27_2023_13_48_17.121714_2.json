These links could be formatted differently than local file paths.\n\n4. **Diverse Image Formats**: Image files could be in various formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF), and the parser must recognize all relevant image file extensions.\n\n5. **Non-image Links**: The ORG file might contain other types of links that are not images.
