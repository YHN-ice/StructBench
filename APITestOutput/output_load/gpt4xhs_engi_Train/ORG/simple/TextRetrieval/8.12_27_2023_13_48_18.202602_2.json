Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Different Image Syntaxes**: ORG files can include images using various syntaxes. For instance, images could be linked with org-mode links (`[[file:image.jpg]]`) or with markup like HTML (`<img src=\"image.jpg\"/>`) within the ORG file. Recognizing all possible syntaxes is necessary.\n\n2. **File Paths**: Images can be referenced via absolute or relative paths. Relative paths might be relative to the ORG file's location or another base directory if specified in the ORG file metadata.\n\n3. **Embedded Images**: Some images might be embedded directly in the file (e.g., as base64 encoded strings) rather than linked as separate files.\n\n4. **Conditional Inclusions**: Some images might be included conditionally, for example within a macro or a special block that is only evaluated under certain conditions.\n\n5. **Comments**: Image references could be part of comments and not meant to be treated as included images.\n\n6. **Markup Language**: If the ORG file is using different markup languages for content export (like LaTeX, HTML), the image inclusion syntax could vary depending on the export target.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: We need to correctly identify image file extensions, but there may be non-standard or less common image file extensions that need to be accounted for.\n\n8. **Hidden Files**: In Unix-like systems, files starting with a dot are hidden and they could also be image files.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a robust parsing algorithm would need to account for these variations and uncertainties to accurately extract all included image filenames."
