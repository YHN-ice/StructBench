Distinguishing between these and extracting only file names of linked images requires different approaches.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: Recognizing what constitutes an image file based on the extension might be challenging if the ORG file includes uncommon or proprietary image formats.\n\n5. **Textual Noise**: The ORG file may contain text that resembles file paths but isn't actually referring to image files.

        "To extract the image file names from the given input, we can use a simple regular expression to match the pattern of image file names enclosed in double square brackets. Since we are provided with a text snippet, let's assume the images are identified by the `[[` and `]]` markers and have a `.jpg` extension.\n\nHere's the regular expression we'll use to find the image file names:\n\n```\n\\[\\[(.*?)\\.jpg\\]\\]\n```\n\nThis regex captures the content between `[[` and `.jpg]]`. We will then extract the group matched by `(.*?)` which corresponds to the file name.\n\nNow, let's apply this regex to the input text to extract the image file names:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ninput_text = \"\"\"\ny\nsalvage lamb salvage monkey*apple* w[[wg.jpg]]ake far essence monkey\n* z\ntransformer lamb[[xg.jpg]] salvage monkey wake far essence monkey\n** ab\nunique lamb salvage*banana* monkey wake far essence [[yg.jpg]]monkey\n\"\"\"\n\n# Regular expression to match image file names within double square brackets with .jpg extension\nimage_regex = r\"\\[\\[(.*?)\\.jpg\\]\\]\"\n\n# Find all matches in the input text\nimage_file_names = re.findall(image_regex, input_text)\n\n# Print each file name on a new line\nprint(\"\\n\".join(image_file_names))\n```\n\nWhen you run this Python code, it should output:\n\n```\nwg.jpg\nxg.jpg\nyg.jpg\n```\n\nIf you want to extract filenames with other image extensions as well, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly."
