It's typically marked with asterisks (*) or equal signs (=) on both sides of the text, but variations in formatting could cause inconsistencies.\n\n2. **Embedded Formatting**: Bold text might be within other formatting elements like lists, headers, links, or code blocks. This could complicate the extraction process because we'd need to carefully identify the bold text without including surrounding formatting characters.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: There might be escape characters that are used to display what would otherwise be formatting characters. For instance, a backslash (\\) might be used to display an asterisk (*) which shouldn't be confused with bold formatting.\n\n4. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting within it, like italic or underlined text, which might make it difficult to extract only the bold portion.\n\n5. **Multiple Bold Sections on the Same Line**: There may be multiple sections of bold text on the same line, separated by non-bold text. Each bold section will need to be identified and extracted separately.\n\n6. **File Encoding and Special Characters**: The ORG file could contain special characters or be encoded in a way that might not be compatible with the parser being used, leading to potential misinterpretation of the content.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a robust parser must take into account these factors to correctly extract all bold texts from an ORG file. Now, please provide the ORG file content so I can proceed with parsing and extracting the bold text as required."
