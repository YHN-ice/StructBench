Handling false positives: Asterisks can also be used for other purposes, like bullet points or italic text (wrapped with slashes, e.g., /italic/). We must ensure we don't confuse these with bold formatting.\n\n3. Nested formatting: ORG files can contain nested formatting, such as bold text within italicized text and vice versa. The parser should handle these cases without mistakenly parsing non-bold text.\n\n4. Multi-line bold text: If bold text spans multiple lines, we need to make sure we capture the entire content across lines.\n\n5. Escape characters: In some cases, asterisks might be escaped (e.g., \\*not bold\\*), which means they are not used for formatting. We have to take into account escaping.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can look for patterns that match the bold syntax while being careful of the points mentioned above.
