It's necessary to identify the correct syntax that represents image links within the file. This can vary depending on the convention used in the ORG file.\n\n2. **Variety of Formats**: Images can be in different formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`). The parser must be ready to recognize various image file extensions.\n\n3. **Inline Images vs. Attachments**: Images may be included inline with text or as attachments. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The file names could be provided with absolute paths, relative paths, or just the file names. The parser should extract just the file names if that's what's being asked.\n\n5. **Link Formatting**: The markup of an image link in an ORG file might include additional formatting or descriptions that need to be parsed out to get the clean file name.\n\n6. **Embedded Base64 or Binary Data**: Sometimes, images are embedded directly into files using Base64 encoding or binary data. The parser should differentiate between links to files and embedded data if the task is to extract file names.\n\n7. **Syntax Variations and Errors**: There might be variations in the syntax or accidental errors within the ORG file that could make it harder to identify image files accurately.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the extraction process must account for different scenarios and ensure accurate identification and extraction of image file names from the ORG file content."
