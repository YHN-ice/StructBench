A parser must handle all possible inclusion methods.\n\n2. **Link Variability**: Image links may come in different formats, such as relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs, and might require normalization to extract just the file names.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: The parser must recognize various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and ensure it does not mistakenly include non-image files.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: If the ORG file includes links with special characters or in non-standard encodings, this could pose challenges in accurately parsing the file names.\n\n5. **Commented or Inactive Links**: Some links to images might be commented out or otherwise not actually intended as active links, and the parser needs rules to ignore these.\n\n6. **Textual Ambiguity**: There might be text that looks like an image file but is not meant to be an image link (e.g., example paths in documentation).\n\n7. **Complexity of File Structure**: If the ORG file structure is complex with many nested sections, the parser needs to traverse this structure accurately to find all included images.\n\n8. **Performance Constraints**: If the ORG file is large and contains a lot of content, parsing performance might be an issue.\n\n9. **Error Handling**: The parser must gracefully handle errors and unexpected input without crashing or providing false results.\n\n10. **Updates and Versions**: The syntax for linking images in ORG files might change over time, so the parser should be updated according to the latest specifications.\n\nEach of these points represents a challenge that must be addressed to accurately extract all included image file names from an ORG file."
