Identifying the syntax: Bold texts in ORG files are commonly marked with asterisks. The parser must correctly identify the syntax for bold formatting, which is typically `*bold text*`.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting styles, such as italic or underlined text. The parser must be able to handle nested formatting and still correctly extract the bold parts.\n\n3. Partial bolding within a line: There could be lines where only certain words are bolded, and the parser needs to extract only those parts without including the non-bold text.\n\n4. Inconsistent formatting: Users might not always follow the proper syntax for bold formatting, leading to variations that the parser needs to account for.\n\n5. Special characters: If the bold text includes special characters or symbols, they should be handled correctly and included in the output.\n\n6. Escaped asterisks: Asterisks used for purposes other than formatting (e.g., in code blocks or to denote lists) should not be mistaken for bold formatting.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I'll address these challenges as needed and extract all the bold texts, presenting them separated by a newline."
