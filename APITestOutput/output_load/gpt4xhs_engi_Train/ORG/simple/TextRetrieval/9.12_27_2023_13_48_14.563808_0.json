Typically, it uses asterisks to denote bold text (e.g., `*bold text*`), but there may be variations or additional whitespace that needs to be handled.\n\n2. **Embedded Markup**: Bold text might contain other markup inside of it, such as links, italics, underlines, code snippets, etc., which may complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as for list items or headlines. The system must distinguish between these uses and bold text.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser should correctly handle this case and not break the bold text into separate parts.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: There may be escape characters within the org file that prevent text from being interpreted as bold when it otherwise would match the pattern.\n\n6. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can also be nested within other formatting elements, or contain nested formatting itself, making extraction more complex.\n\n7. **Incomplete Formatting**: Sometimes users mistakenly leave formatting incomplete (e.g., missing one asterisk), which might lead to incorrect extraction if not accounted for.\n\n8. **Contextual Parsing**: In some cases, the context might determine whether asterisks are used as bold markers or for other purposes.\n\nTo effectively extract all bold texts while accounting for these potential issues, the parser would need to be robust and context-aware, possibly involving regular expressions or a state machine to accurately interpret the formatting."
