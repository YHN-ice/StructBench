Typically, it's done with asterisks `*text*`, but there could be variations or other markup syntaxes used that need to be accounted for.\n\n2. **Nested Markup**: Bold text might be nested within other markup, such as links, italic text, or code blocks. This can complicate the parsing process if we need to extract just the bold text without any surrounding markup.\n\n3. **Incomplete Markup**: Sometimes, markup errors can occur where the asterisks are not correctly paired. Parsing routines need to handle these gracefully.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Characters like asterisks might be escaped in the text, meaning they are not intended to format the text but rather to be included as literal characters. The parser needs to recognize and correctly handle these cases.\n\n5. **Multiple Bold Sections**: There could be multiple sections of bold text on a single line or across multiple lines which need to be individually identified and extracted.\n\n6. **Embedded Code or Special Blocks**: ORG files can include special blocks for code, quotes, etc. Bold markup inside these blocks may not follow the same rules as regular text and might require special handling.\n\n7. **Line Continuations**: In some cases, formatting can span across line breaks, and the parser will need to handle these continuations properly.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we'll need to carefully parse it considering these potential issues to accurately extract all bold texts."
