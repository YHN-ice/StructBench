However, the number of asterisks and whitespace variations can affect text recognition. I need to correctly identify the pattern used for bold text.\n\n2. **Embedded markup**: Bold text may contain other markup inside it, such as links, italic text, or code snippets. Distinguishing the bold text from other markup within it could be complex.\n\n3. **Multiline bold text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it might be tricky to correctly parse and extract it as a single entry without breaking it into separate lines.\n\n4. **Special characters**: The presence of special characters like asterisks within a non-bold text or escaped asterisks could lead to false positives or negatives.\n\n5. **Partial bolding**: In some cases, only part of a word or sentence might be bolded, which means I need to extract only the relevant part without including adjacent non-bold text.\n\n6. **Ambiguity with headings**: ORG files also use asterisks to denote headings (e.g., `* Heading 1`, `** Heading 2`), so distinguishing between bold text and headings might be a problem if not handled properly.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, I would need a clear understanding of the ORG file's markup syntax and implement logic to handle each case accordingly."
