For example, text may be wrapped like this: `*bold text*` or `=bold text=`. It's crucial to correctly recognize the pattern used for bold text.\n\n2. **Handling nested formatting:** Bold text in ORG files may be nested within other formatting options, like italic or underlined text. The parser must be able to extract bold text without being confused by other formatting.\n\n3. **Dealing with broken formatting:** If the ORG file has incorrectly formatted bold text (e.g., missing an asterisk at the end), the parser must decide how to handle these cases—whether to attempt a recovery of the intended formatting or skip such instances.\n\n4. **Multi-line bold text:** Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser should concatenate such lines and recognize them as a single bold text block.\n\n5. **Escaped characters:** The parser must distinguish between actual formatting markers and escaped characters that are meant to display asterisks or equal signs literally rather than format the text.\n\nOnce we have the input file, I will read and analyze it to extract all bold texts.
