Identifying image links: ORG files can contain various types of links, not just image links. We'll need to discern which links are to image files.\n\n2. File path variations: Image links in ORG files can be absolute or relative, and they may vary in format. We'll need to detect all possible formats.\n\n3. Inline images vs. attachments: ORG files may include images that are displayed inline in the document or attached as separate files. We have to ensure we capture both.\n\n4. Link formatting: Links to images could be formatted differently (e.g., direct links, descriptive links using square brackets, etc.) within the ORG file.\n\n5. File extensions: We need to know which file extensions to look for that represent images (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.).\n\n6.
