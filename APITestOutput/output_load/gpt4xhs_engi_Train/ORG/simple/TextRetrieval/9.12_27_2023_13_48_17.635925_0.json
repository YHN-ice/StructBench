We'll need to ensure we correctly identify the pattern used to mark text as bold, which is typically surrounding text with asterisks, like `*text*`.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements such as italic, underlined, code blocks, or links. We need to accurately parse out the bold text without being confused by surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: There might be escaped characters or asterisks used within the ORG file that are not intended to denote bold text. We must distinguish between actual formatting markers and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which can make it harder to extract since some parsers might be designed to work on a line-by-line basis.\n\n5. **Complex Documents**: ORG files can include a variety of elements such as tables, lists, and headlines. Bold texts within these elements must be accurately recognized and extracted.\n\n6. **Markup Variations**: There may be variations in how different users or systems mark bold text within ORG files, although there's a standard, some may use unconventional methods.\n\n7. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, the bold markers may not be correctly paired or closed, which can lead to incorrect parsing of the document structure.\n\n8. **Diverse Content**: Since ORG files are used for a wide range of applications—from personal notes to complex project management—content can be very diverse and unpredictable, making parsing more difficult.\n\nIt's essential to develop a robust parsing strategy that accounts for these potential issues to ensure accuracy when extracting bold text from an ORG file."
