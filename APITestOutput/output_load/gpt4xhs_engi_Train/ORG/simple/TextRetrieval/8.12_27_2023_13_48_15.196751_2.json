The parser must distinguish between image files and other types of file links.\n6. **Markup Variations**: The way images are included might vary with different versions of ORG mode or user-specific markup configurations.\n7. **Comments or Inactive Links**: Some image links might be commented out or inactive, and the parser should decide whether to include or exclude these.\n\nTo handle these issues, the parser would need to:\n\n- Recognize all the different syntaxes for including images.\n- Normalize relative paths if necessary.\n- Filter out non-image file links.\n- Possibly decode embedded images if required.\n- Handle commented or inactive links according to the desired outcome.\n\nNow you may provide the ORG file content you want to parse, and I'll look for the image file names according to these considerations."
