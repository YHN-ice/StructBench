The parser must correctly identify the start and end of each bold text segment, which is usually marked by a pair of asterisks (e.g., `*bold text*`).\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting options like italic, underlined, or code segments. The parser needs to distinguish between asterisks used for bold formatting and those used for other purposes.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes asterisks are used in the text not for formatting but as literal characters. The parser must recognize escape characters or patterns that indicate the asterisks should not be treated as formatting markers.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must be able to handle this and not assume that a new line signifies the end of a formatting block.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users may not always correctly follow the formatting rules, leading to inconsistencies such as missing closing asterisks or uneven numbers of asterisks.\n\n6. **Different Versions of Org Mode**: If there are different versions or flavors of Org mode files, the syntax for bold text might vary slightly, which needs to be considered.\n\nOnce I have the input ORG file content, I can parse it for bold texts while keeping in mind these potential challenges."
