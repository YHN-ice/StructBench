It's essential to correctly identify the syntax used for bold text so that it can be accurately extracted.\n   \n2. Nested Formatting: Bold text might also have other formatting nested inside it, such as italicized text, links, or code snippets. It's important to handle these cases correctly and only extract the bold text.\n\n3. Multiline Text: Bold text in ORG files might span multiple lines. The parser will need to handle multiline formatting without breaking the extraction process.\n\n4. Inconsistent Formatting: Users might not always follow the exact formatting rules for bold text, which can lead to inconsistent use of asterisks or other markers. This makes it harder to parse the text reliably.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: Sometimes, characters used to denote formatting (like asterisks) may be escaped to display them literally rather than as formatting. The parser must distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must have a robust pattern matching system that can accurately identify bold text while dealing with the above difficulties. Once the file is provided, I can attempt to extract the bold texts given the correct syntax and structure of the ORG file."
