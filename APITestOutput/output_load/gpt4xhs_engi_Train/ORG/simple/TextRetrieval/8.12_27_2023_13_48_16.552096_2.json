For instance, images can be included as links or as inline objects. Recognizing all possible syntax variations for image inclusion is essential.\n\n2. **File Path Ambiguity**: The file paths of the images could be absolute or relative. For relative paths, it might not be clear what the base directory is without additional context.\n\n3. **Link Versus Image**: Not all links are to image files. Distinguishing between links to images and links to other types of files or URLs is necessary.\n\n4. **Textual Noise**: The image filenames might be surrounded by other text or markup that needs to be parsed out.\n\n5. **Markup Syntax**: ORG files support a rich set of markup for different purposes (like headers, lists, tables, etc.). Correctly parsing the file to ignore non-relevant markup while extracting image filenames is critical.\n\n6. **Hidden Images**: Images might be commented out or included in a way that they are not meant to be parsed (e.g., within code blocks or examples). Deciding whether to include these could be a challenge.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Identifying what constitutes an image file may require knowing which file extensions are considered images (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.).\n\n8. **Encoded or Embedded Images**: Sometimes images could be encoded in base64 or embedded in a different format within the ORG file, which would require special handling to extract their filenames, if they are even present in a typical file-naming format.\n\nUnderstanding these difficulties can help in creating a more robust parsing strategy to accurately extract image file names from an ORG file."
