The parser needs to recognize all possible formats.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image links could be given as relative or absolute paths, so the parser must handle both correctly to extract just the file names.\n\n3. **Embedded vs Attached Images**: Images can be directly embedded in the ORG file or attached as external files. The parser should distinguish between these and handle accordingly.\n\n4. **Non-image File Links**: An ORG file may contain links to non-image files. The parser must filter out links to non-image files.\n\n5. **Markup Variability**: There may be variations in the markup that could affect how images are included, such as different bracket types or additional attributes that need to be accounted for.\n\n6. **Comments and Inactive Links**: Some images might be within commented sections or set as inactive links, which might not be intended for extraction.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There may be lines with multiple image links that need to be individually parsed and extracted.\n\n8. **Unconventional File Extensions**: Some image files might have unconventional extensions that are not standard (e.g., .tiff vs .tif), and the parser should be able to recognize all valid image formats.\n\nTo address these issues, the parser should:\n- Have a comprehensive list of valid image file extensions.\n- Be able to recognize different link markup formats.\n- Distinguish between active links and text that isn't meant to represent a link, such as comments.\n- Extract only the filename from a path, ignoring leading directories or other parts of the link syntax.\n- Handle both relative and absolute paths appropriately."
