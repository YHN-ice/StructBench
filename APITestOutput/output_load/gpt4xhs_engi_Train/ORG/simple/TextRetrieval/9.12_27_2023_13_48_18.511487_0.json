Typically, it is denoted by surrounding the text with asterisks, like this: `*bold*`. However, there might be variations in how this is used, such as using different numbers of asterisks or other characters.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold text might not always be on its own line; it could be inline with other text. This means that simply looking for lines that start and end with asterisks wouldn't be sufficient; the parser must be able to recognize bold text within a line.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: There might be asterisks that are meant to be literal asterisks rather than formatting (e.g., they could be escaped with a backslash), which shouldn't be mistaken for bold formatting.\n\n4. **Nested Formatting**: ORG files may have nested formatting, where bold text might also be italicized, underlined, or otherwise formatted, further complicating the extraction process.\n\n5. **Multiple Bold Segments**: There could be multiple segments of bold text on a single line, which need to be identified and extracted separately.\n\n6. **Differentiating from Headings**: In ORG files, headings are also denoted with asterisks, but they have a different purpose and format (e.g., `* Heading`). The parser must differentiate between headings and bold text.\n\n7. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be instances where the formatting is incomplete or erroneous (e.g., missing an asterisk at one end), which could lead to incorrect extraction if not handled properly.\n\nEach of these points represents a challenge that must be addressed to accurately extract bold texts from an ORG file. The parser needs to be robust and flexible enough to handle these cases correctly, ensuring that only the intended bold text is extracted."
