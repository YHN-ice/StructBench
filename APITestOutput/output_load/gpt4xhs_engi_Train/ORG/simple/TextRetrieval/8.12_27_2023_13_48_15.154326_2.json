Here are some common obstacles and difficulties that might be encountered:\n\n1. Different Image Syntax: ORG mode can include images using a variety of syntax options, such as links or dedicated directives. I will need to recognize all the possible syntaxes to ensure no images are missed.\n\n2. Inline Images vs. Image Links: ORG files may have images that are displayed inline or just linked within the text. Distinguishing between these cases may be necessary depending on the requirements.\n\n3. Relative vs. Absolute Paths: Images could be included with either relative or absolute paths. If only file names are needed, I'll need to parse out just the file name portion of the path.\n\n4. File Name Variations: Image file names may have different extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) or could include spaces and special characters, which can complicate parsing.\n\n5. Embedded Base64 Images: In some cases, ORG files might contain images encoded in Base64 directly within the text. These would not have traditional file names but could still be considered included images.\n\n6. Conditional Inclusions: ORG files can contain conditional statements that might affect whether an image is included or not, depending on certain conditions being met.\n\n7. Encrypted Sections: If an ORG file has encrypted sections, it might be impossible to extract image paths from those sections without decryption.\n\n8. Multi-line Links: Sometimes links, including image links, may be broken up across multiple lines for formatting reasons, necessitating a multi-line parsing strategy.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I will identify which of these potential issues are present and address them accordingly to extract all included image file names."
