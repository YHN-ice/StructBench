Images may be included with specific markup or syntax that needs to be recognized by the parser.\n\n2. **Different Inclusion Syntaxes**: ORG files may include images using different syntaxes or directives. Some may use links, while others may embed images directly.\n\n3. **Variety of Image Formats**: The ORG file could contain various types of image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF). Each format may have different representation or inclusion methods within the text.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths could be absolute or relative, and for relative paths, additional context about the ORG file's directory structure would be needed to locate the image files.\n\n5. **Textual Ambiguity**: Text that is not an image file but looks like one could confuse the parser (e.g., a filename mentioned in the text that is not actually an included image).\n\n6. **Extracting from Links**: Images might not be included with a clear indication that they are images; they might be part of hyperlinks where the URL ends with an image extension.\n\n7. **Image References**: The ORG file might reference images that are not physically included within the file but are linked to external sources.\n\n8. **File Accessibility**: If the objective is to not just list but also access or copy the files, there may be issues with file permissions or missing files.\n\nCorrectly parsing the ORG file and extracting the names of image files will involve creating or using a parser that can handle these challenges effectively."
