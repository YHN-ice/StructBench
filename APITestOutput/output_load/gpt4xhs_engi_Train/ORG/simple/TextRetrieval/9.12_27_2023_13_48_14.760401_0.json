It is typically denoted by asterisks surrounding the text (e.g., `*bold*`). However, there might be variations like using different markup languages that could be embedded in the ORG file.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold texts could be nested within other formatting options, like italic, underline, or code blocks. This may require a more complex parsing strategy to identify only the bold portions.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might have escaped asterisks within the text for different purposes. An escaped asterisk does not indicate bold formatting, so the parser needs to distinguish between actual formatting and literal asterisks.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: The ORG file might contain inconsistencies where the text is not correctly formatted according to the standard, such as missing closing asterisks or additional spaces that could confuse the parser.\n\n5. **Links and Footnotes**: Bold text could contain links or footnotes that might have a different syntax. Extracting just the text while maintaining readability without the link references could be challenging.\n\n6. **Line Continuations**: If a line containing bold text wraps to the next line, it might cause issues with correctly identifying and extracting the bold text unless the parser correctly interprets line continuations.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser may need to implement a robust regular expression or a state machine that can accurately identify bold text while considering the various edge cases and formatting nuances that might appear in an ORG file."

        "Based on the input provided, the bold texts are denoted by either a single asterisk `*` or double asterisks `**` before the text. The input seems to contain two instances of bold text marked with asterisks:\n\n- Single asterisk: `* u`\n- Double asterisk: `** v`\n\nBoth of these instances are followed by a new line, which indicates that they are separate from any other text. To extract the bold texts and print them separated by a newline, we can simply print the text that follows the asterisks, as follows:\n\n```\nu\nv\n``` \n\nThis is a simple extraction based on the given input.
