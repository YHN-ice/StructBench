Some could point to local resources while others might reference online sources. Distinguishing between these and extracting just the file names might require additional logic.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: Images can have a variety of file extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.). The parser must be able to recognize all common image formats.\n\n5. **Link Text**: Links may have descriptive text that could be confused with the file name if the parser is not careful about how it identifies the name of the file.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: File names could contain spaces or special characters that are escaped or represented differently in the .org file, which need to be interpreted correctly.\n\nAfter identifying these challenges, we can proceed with processing the input file.
