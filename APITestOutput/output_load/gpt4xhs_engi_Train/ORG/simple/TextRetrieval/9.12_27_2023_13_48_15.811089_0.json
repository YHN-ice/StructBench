Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. **Variations in Markup**: ORG files can use different markup to denote bold text. The most common syntax is wrapping text with asterisks (e.g., `*bold*`), but variations or configurations may change this. Being aware of all possible bold syntaxes is essential.\n\n2. **Nested Markup**: ORG files allow for nested markup, which means bold text could also contain other formatting like italics, underlines, or code blocks. Parsing nested markup correctly to extract only the bold text while ignoring or properly handling the nested formatting can be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks might be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as markup (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`). Distinguishing between actual bold markup and escaped characters that look like markup is necessary.\n\n4. **Multiple Instances**: Bold texts can appear multiple times within a document, and they may span across lines or be part of lists, headers, or other structures, complicating the parsing process.\n\n5. **Contextual Interpretation**: In some cases, the asterisks may not denote bold but could be used for other purposes, such as list items or sections. Understanding the context to interpret the asterisks correctly is crucial.\n\n6. **Incomplete Markup**: There could be instances where the markup for bold text is not properly closed (e.g., `*bold`), leading to ambiguity in what constitutes bold text.\n\n7. **Performance**: If the ORG file is large, ensuring that the parser performs efficiently while searching through potentially large amounts of text might be a concern.\n\n8. **Encoding and Special Characters**: The file may include special characters or use different encodings, which could affect how the text is read and interpreted.\n\nEach of these potential issues would require specific handling in the parsing logic to ensure accurate extraction of all bold texts.
