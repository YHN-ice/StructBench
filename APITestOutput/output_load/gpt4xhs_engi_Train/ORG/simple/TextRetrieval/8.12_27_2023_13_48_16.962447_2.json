The parser should be able to extract the file name regardless of the path format.\n\n3. **Link Formatting:** In ORG files, links might be formatted differently. For example, they can be plain links or formatted with descriptive text using double-square brackets syntax (`[[link][description]]`). The parser needs to handle these variations.\n\n4. **Embedded vs. Linked Images:** Some ORG files may embed images through base64 encoding or similar methods, rather than linking to a file. The focus here is on linked images, so embedded images would not be relevant.\n\n5. **Non-image File Links:** There might be links to non-image files or other non-relevant content that need to be distinguished from image file links.\n\n6. **File Name Extraction:** Once an image link is identified, the parser must correctly extract just the file name and not any surrounding markup or text.\n\n7. **Duplicates:** The same image might be included multiple times. It would need to be determined whether to list duplicates or to filter them out.\n\n8. **Invalid File Names:** Some links might appear to reference images but have typos or errors in the file name, leading to invalid references.\n\nWith these potential difficulties in mind, let's proceed with parsing the ORG file when you provide it.
