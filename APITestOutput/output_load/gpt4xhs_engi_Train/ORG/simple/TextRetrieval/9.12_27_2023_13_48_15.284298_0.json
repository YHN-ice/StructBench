Typically, asterisks (*) are used for this purpose. It's essential to correctly identify the markup pattern, which usually involves text enclosed within pairs of asterisks, like *bold text*.\n\n2. **Consistent Formatting**: The text file must have consistent formatting for the parser to identify all bold texts accurately. Any deviation from the standard markup pattern could result in missed instances of bold text.\n\n3. **Handling Nested Formatting**: ORG files may contain nested formatting where bold text can also have other formatting like italic, underline, or code. Special handling might be necessary to extract only the bold text.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Text**: If bold formatting spans across multiple lines, the parser must be able to handle this scenario and not just look for bold text within a single line.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks may be used in the text not as markup but as literal characters, possibly escaped by a backslash or another method. The parser must differentiate between actual bold markup and escaped asterisks.\n\n6. **Differentiating Between Single and Multiple Asterisks**: ORG files also use asterisks to denote headings (with one or more asterisks at the beginning of a line). The parser must distinguish between these and bold markup within the text.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to consider these potential difficulties to accurately extract all bold texts."
