The parser must handle both cases properly.\n\n3. **Linked vs Embedded images**: Images in ORG files can be linked from external sources or embedded directly. Embedded images might require different parsing techniques.\n\n4. **File format diversity**: Images can come in various formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.). The parser should be aware of different image extensions to identify them correctly.\n\n5. **Comments or inactive links**: Sometimes image links might be present in comments or as inactive links, which may or may not be intended to be extracted depending on the context.\n\n6. **ORG file-specific markup**: ORG files have their own markup for structuring content. An understanding of this markup is necessary to correctly parse and identify image files.\n\n7. **Multiline links**: Image links might span multiple lines, especially if they have long URLs or are part of a descriptive text block.\n\nNow please provide the ORG file content so that I can extract the image file names for you."
