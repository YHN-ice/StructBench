Recognizing all these patterns is necessary.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images in ORG files could be referenced via absolute paths, relative paths, or even URLs. Handling each type correctly is important to identify the image file names.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: There can be a variety of file extensions for images (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser needs to be able to recognize all possible extensions that represent image files.\n\n4. **Markup Variations**: ORG files may have different markup styles or additional attributes alongside the image links that could complicate the extraction.\n\n5. **File Name Extraction**: Once an image link is identified, extracting just the file name (without path or extra attributes) might require additional parsing logic.\n\n6. **Hidden or Encoded Images**: Sometimes images may be included in encoded forms or generated by scripts. These would not be as straightforward to extract merely by parsing text.\n\n7. **Embedded Objects**: If images are embedded as objects rather than linked files, it may require decoding binary data.\n\nOnce I am provided with the input ORG file content, I will proceed with extracting the image file names while addressing these challenges. If you provide me with the content now, I'll do my best to parse it according to the constraints up until my knowledge cut-off date."
