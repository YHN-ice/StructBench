We need to recognize the syntax used for image embedding or linking.\n\n2. **Different Link Formats**: Images may be included using different link formats or markup styles. For example, some may use direct URL links, while others might use relative paths or embed base64 encoded images.\n\n3. **Variety of Image Formats**: There are multiple image formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) that could be present, and the parser needs to recognize and handle each one.\n\n4. **Text Ambiguity**: There might be text strings that resemble file paths or URLs but aren't actually links to images. Distinguishing between actual image links and similar non-link text is crucial.\n\n5. **Extraction Accuracy**: We must ensure that the extracted filenames are accurate and complete, without any additional text or formatting characters.\n\n6. **Formatting Complexity**: ORG files support a rich set of formatting options. Images might be included within different structures like lists, tables, or even source blocks, which may complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **File Accessibility**: If the parser is expected to verify the existence of the files or access their contents, it might face permission issues or the files may not be available locally.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the ORG file is large with many images included, performance could become a concern depending on how the parser is implemented.\n\nOnce we encounter an ORG file input, we will have to address these challenges accordingly to successfully extract all image filenames."
