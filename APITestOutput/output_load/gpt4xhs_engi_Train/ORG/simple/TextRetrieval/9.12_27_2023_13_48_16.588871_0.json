Typically, bold is denoted by wrapping text with asterisks (e.g., `*bold*`), but variations may exist or additional non-standard markup could be used.\n\n2. **Nested Markup:** Bold text might be nested within other markup, such as links, italics, underlines, etc., which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Multiline Bold Texts:** Bold text in ORG files can span multiple lines. A parser would need to handle multiline patterns appropriately.\n\n4. **Escape Characters:** There might be escape characters used in the ORG file that prevent certain asterisks from being interpreted as bold markers.\n\n5. **False Positives:** Asterisks can be used for other purposes, such as list items or headings. The parser needs to differentiate between these and actual bold markers.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Use of Whitespace:** Whitespace or line breaks around the bold markers could be inconsistent, which might require more sophisticated parsing logic beyond simple regex.\n\n7. **Incomplete or Malformed Markup:** Sometimes the markup may be incomplete or malformed (e.g., missing a closing asterisk), which would make it difficult to determine the intended formatting.\n\nDeveloping a parser that can robustly handle all these cases requires careful consideration of the ORG file syntax and potentially some assumptions about the formatting conventions used in a given file."
