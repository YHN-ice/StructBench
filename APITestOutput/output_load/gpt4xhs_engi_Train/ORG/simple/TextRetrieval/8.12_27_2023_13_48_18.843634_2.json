Images might be linked using any of these formats, so the parser must handle all possible variations.\n\n2. **File path variations:** Image links could be absolute paths, relative paths, or even URLs. The parser must correctly identify the image file names from these various path formats.\n\n3. **Image file extensions:** There are multiple image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser must recognize all the relevant extensions to correctly extract image file names.\n\n4. **Link syntax:** ORG files use specific syntax for links. The parser must accurately interpret this syntax to correctly identify image links. For instance, it should distinguish between a link and a similar-looking text that is not a link.\n\n5. **Embedded vs. attached images:** Images might be directly embedded in the ORG file or merely linked as attachments. The parser needs to extract the file names in both cases.\n\n6. **Non-image files:** The ORG file could contain links to non-image files, which the parser should not extract when the aim is to get only image file names.\n\n7. **Special characters and spaces:** File names may contain spaces, special characters, or Unicode characters which could be encoded differently within links. The parser must handle decoding and parsing these correctly.\n\nWe will need to navigate these issues carefully in order to accurately extract all the image file names from the ORG file provided."
