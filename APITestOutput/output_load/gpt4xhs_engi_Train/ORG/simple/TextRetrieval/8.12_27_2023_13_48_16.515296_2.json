The parser must correctly identify and differentiate image file links from other types of links.\n\n3. **Path Recognition**: Images can be linked with absolute or relative paths. The parser must correctly process both to extract the file names.\n\n4. **Embedded Images**: Images can also be embedded inline using base64 or other encoding schemes, rather than linked by filename. Detecting and handling these cases might be complex.\n\n5. **File Extension Handling**: There are various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). The parser needs to recognize all possible image extensions to accurately extract the filenames.\n\n6. **ORG Markup Complexity**: ORG files can have complex structures with headings, lists, tables, etc. The parser must navigate this structure accurately to find image links.\n\n7. **Comments and Archival**: Image links might be within commented sections or parts of the document that are archived or otherwise not meant to be processed.\n\n8. **External Resources**: Some images might be linked from external sources (i.e., URLs), and distinguishing them from local files is necessary when only local image filenames are required.\n\n9. **Escape Characters**: Filenames may contain escape characters or spaces that need proper handling to extract the correct filename.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: The file could use a character encoding that doesn't match the system default, leading to issues in interpreting the content.\n\nOnce we see the input ORG file content, we'll need to address these potential difficulties accordingly to accurately extract all included image file names."
