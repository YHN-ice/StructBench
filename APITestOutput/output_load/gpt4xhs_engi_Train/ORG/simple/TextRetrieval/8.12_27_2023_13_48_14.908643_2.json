Some may be directly linked with a URL, others could be embedded with a file path, and the syntax could vary.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths:** The file paths of images could be relative or absolute. The parser must handle both cases appropriately to extract the correct file names.\n\n4. **Image References Inside Markup:** Images could be part of a larger markup construct, like being nested inside a hyperlink or a caption. The parser should be capable of isolating the image references from surrounding markup.\n\n5. **Text that Looks Like Image Links:** There might be text within the ORG file that looks like an image link but isn't one (e.g., example text or commented-out lines). The parser needs to distinguish between actual image links and non-link text.\n\n6. **File Accessibility:** If the parser is expected to verify the existence of these images, it might need to handle cases where files are not accessible due to permissions or incorrect paths.\n\n7. **Encoding and Character Escapes:** Special characters in file names or paths may be escaped or encoded in certain ways within the ORG file, and the parser will need to decode these correctly to extract the actual file name.\n\n8. **Unique Syntax Rules of ORG Format:** ORG files have their own syntax rules that must be understood and handled correctly by the parser (for example, dealing with headlines, blocks, or drawer structures that might contain image links).\n\nFor an accurate extraction process, all these potential issues must be taken into account by the parser logic.
