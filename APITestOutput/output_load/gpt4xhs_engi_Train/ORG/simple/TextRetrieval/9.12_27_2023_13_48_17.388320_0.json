Users might use a different number of asterisks or other markers for emphasis, leading to inconsistencies.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other formatting elements like italic, code, or underline, which might make it challenging to isolate the bold text correctly.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: The presence of special characters within or adjacent to the bold markers could complicate the parsing process. For example, asterisks are also used for lists or are part of a link.\n\n4. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, so a parser needs to handle line continuation properly without breaking the bold text extraction.\n\n5. **Contextual Differences**: Sometimes the meaning of asterisks can be context-dependent (e.g., used for emphasis vs. denoting a list item). Distinguishing between these uses could be complex.\n\nTo give a correct answer, the parser (or code) would need to reliably interpret the ORG file's syntax and structure, considering these potential issues."
