It's important to properly recognize the syntax for bold text, which typically involves asterisks or plus signs (e.g., `*bold*` or `+bold+`). However, asterisks might also be used for other purposes, such as bullet points or italic text.\n\n2. **Inline Markup**: Bold text can appear inline with other text, so we need to ensure we can extract it without pulling in non-bold text that might be adjacent to it.\n\n3. **Nested Markup**: ORG files can contain nested markup where bold text is within other formatting (such as a section heading or a list item). We need to ensure we correctly parse such structures and extract only the bold parts.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Users may escape markup characters to use them literally rather than as formatting. It's necessary to recognize and properly handle escaped characters so that they're not mistaken for formatting.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser would need to handle line continuations appropriately.\n\n6. **Variations in Formatting**: Users might use slightly different conventions for bolding text within an ORG file. Any parser would need to be flexible enough to handle these variations.\n\n7. **File Read Access**: To parse the file, we'll need read access to it. If the file is large or has restricted access, it may pose additional challenges.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: Depending on the file's encoding, special characters may not be parsed correctly if the parser assumes the wrong encoding.\n\nBy anticipating these difficulties, I can better prepare my parsing logic to handle these scenarios. Now, you can provide me with the ORG file content so I can attempt to extract all bold texts."
