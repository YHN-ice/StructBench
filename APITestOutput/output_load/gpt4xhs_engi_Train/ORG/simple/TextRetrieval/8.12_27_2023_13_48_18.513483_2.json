Our process must handle both cases correctly.\n\n3. **Link vs. Attachment**: Images can be included directly as links or as attachments. We need to differentiate between the two and extract only those that are links to image files.\n\n4. **File Formats**: We must identify what constitutes an image file, which means recognizing various image file formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.).\n\n5. **Non-image Files**: There might be other files or links included in the ORG file that are not image files. We must ensure we're only extracting image files.\n\n6. **Inline vs. Standalone Links**: Images may be included as part of the text or on their own.
