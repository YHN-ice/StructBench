The most common is wrapping text with asterisks, like `*this text is bold*`, but variations could exist (e.g., using different characters or markup styles).\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements such as italics, underlines, or code blocks. Parsing needs to handle these nested formats correctly without losing the bold text.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes asterisks are used in the text not to denote bold formatting but as part of the content itself. These could be escaped in some way that needs to be interpreted correctly.\n\n4. **Partial Bold Texts**: There could be cases where only part of a word or sentence is bolded, and the parser needs to correctly extract only the bold part without including surrounding non-bold text.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which requires the parser to maintain state across line breaks and properly concatenate the bold sections.\n\n6. **Links and References**: In ORG files, links or references might also include bold formatting. The parser needs to differentiate between the link/reference syntax and the bold formatting.\n\n7. **Special Cases**: If there are any special cases like comments or specific directives that change how text should be parsed, these need to be accounted for.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Delimiters**: If the ORG file was manually edited or corrupted, delimiters might be mismatched or missing, leading to challenges in identifying the start and end of bold sections.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, the parser must navigate these potential issues by implementing logic to recognize and correctly interpret the intended bold formatting."
