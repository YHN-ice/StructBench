The parser would have to handle both cases.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Image references might be commented out or included in inactive code blocks, and we would need to decide whether to count these or not.\n\n6. **External Resources**: If the ORG file references external resources, it might not be possible to extract actual file names if they are not explicitly provided in the file.\n\n7. **Encoding and Character Sets**: If the ORG file uses a particular encoding or character set, it might affect how text is parsed and interpreted.\n\n8. **Linked Files**: Sometimes images might not be included directly but instead linked from other files or documents that are included in the ORG file.\n\n9. **Encryption or Compression**: If the ORG file is encrypted or compressed, additional steps would be required to access the contents before parsing.\n\nGiven these potential issues, we'll need to carefully inspect the structure of the input ORG file to develop an accurate method for extracting image file names."
