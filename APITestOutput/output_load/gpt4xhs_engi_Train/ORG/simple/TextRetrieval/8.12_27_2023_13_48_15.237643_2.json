The parser must recognize all the possible ways an image can be included.\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image links could be given as relative or absolute paths, and the parser must handle both types correctly.\n3. **Embedded vs Attached Images**: Some images might be embedded directly into the ORG file using a data URI scheme, while others might be simply linked. Identifying and extracting filenames from embedded images could be more challenging.\n4. **Non-Standard File Extensions**: While most image files will have standard extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., there could be non-standard or less common extensions to consider.\n5. **Markup Variability**: ORG mode allows for a wide range of markup options. Image links could be part of a descriptive list, a table, or inline with the text, and the syntax might vary slightly in each context.\n6. **Comments and Non-image Links**: The ORG file might contain links that are commented out or links to non-image files that need to be ignored.\n7. **Multi-line Links**: In some cases, links to images might be broken up across multiple lines, which could complicate extraction.\n\nThe parser will have to account for these factors to accurately extract and list the names of included image files."
