Identifying Bold Syntax: ORG files generally use asterisks (*) to denote bold text. The typical syntax for bold text in an ORG file is like this: *bold text*. However, asterisks could be used in other contexts (e.g., for list items or headings), so distinguishing bold text from other uses of asterisks is crucial.\n\n2. Multi-line Bold Texts: Bold text may span across multiple lines, which makes parsing a bit more complex as one would have to make sure to capture the entire bold segment without cutting it off at the end of a line.\n\n3. Nested Formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, such as links, code, italics, etc. Properly identifying just the bold part without including other formatting would be necessary.\n\n4. Escaped Characters: Users could escape asterisks (\\*) to use them literally in text without intending for bold formatting. Properly handling escaped characters to avoid false positives is essential.\n\n5. Inconsistent Formatting: Human error or varied personal conventions might result in inconsistent formatting (e.g., missing closing asterisk, uneven number of asterisks), which could make parsing difficult.\n\n6. Handling Large Files: Depending on the size of the ORG file, performance concerns might arise when parsing large documents for bold text.\n\n7. File Access and Reading: Before parsing, there's the technical step of reading the file content into a form that can be processed. This involves handling file I/O operations correctly.\n\nPlease now provide the ORG file content for parsing, and I'll proceed with the task of extracting all bold texts according to the given format."
