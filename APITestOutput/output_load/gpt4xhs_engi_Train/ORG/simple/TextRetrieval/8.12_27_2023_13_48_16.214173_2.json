We need to account for different ways images can be included in the text.\n\n2. **Non-Image File Links**: There may be other file links that are not images. We will need to distinguish between image file links and non-image file links.\n\n3. **Inline Images and Attachment Syntax**: ORG mode supports inline images and attachments. Inline images might not always use the standard `file` tag, and attachments might use a specific attachment syntax that would need to be recognized.\n\n4. **Link Descriptions**: Some links might have descriptions that could include the image file extension, possibly confusing a naive parser looking for image extensions.\n\n5. **Complex Markup**: The ORG file might contain complex markup that could interfere with simple string matching, such as nested structures or links within other elements.\n\n6. **Multiple Links on a Single Line**: There could be multiple image links on a single line, which means the parser should be able to handle multiple matches within the same line of text.\n\n7. **Formatting Variations**: The file might have variations in formatting, whitespace, or capitalization that could affect the pattern matching for image files.\n\n8. **Comments or Inactive Links**: The file might include comments or inactive links that contain image filenames which should not be considered as actual images included in the content.\n\n9. **External Links**: There might be links to external image URLs rather than file paths within the ORG document.\n\n10. **File Path Variations**: Images might be located in different directories or even remote locations, so the parser would need to handle relative and absolute paths, as well as URLs.\n\nThese are just some of the challenges we could encounter.
