We need to handle all possible variations to ensure no image links are missed.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: The paths to image files can be relative or absolute. We need to account for both types when parsing the paths.\n\n3. **Embedded Content**: Images can be directly embedded in the file with base64 or other encoding schemes, which would require decoding to identify the image file names, although this is uncommon for ORG files.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Links**: Some image links might be commented out or marked as inactive. Depending on the requirements, we might need to ignore these or handle them differently.\n\n5. **Link Formatting Issues**: There might be formatting issues within the file, such as broken links, missing brackets, or incorrect syntax that could complicate parsing.\n\n6. **Non-image File Links**: The file may contain links to non-image files that should not be counted as images.\n\n7. **Dynamic Content**: Sometimes, file links may be generated dynamically using macros or scripts within the ORG file, complicating static parsing.\n\n8. **File Extensions**: Image files come with various extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). We need a comprehensive list of image file extensions to correctly identify all image files.\n\nTo overcome these issues, a robust parsing strategy would need to be employed that can handle various formatting scenarios and accurately identify image file names regardless of how they are included in the ORG file."
