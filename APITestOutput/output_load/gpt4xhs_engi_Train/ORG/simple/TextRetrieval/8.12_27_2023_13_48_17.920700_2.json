In ORG mode, images are typically linked using the following syntax:\n\n```\n[[file:image_name.extension]]\n```\n\nSome potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of extracting image file names include:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: Image links might have variations in syntax, such as additional attributes or different link formats. If the parser expects a very strict format, it might miss some links.\n\n2. **Embedded Links**: Images might not just be standalone but could be embedded within other constructs like lists, tables, or paragraphs, which may require context-aware parsing.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links could use absolute or relative paths, and the parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Multiple Links in a Line**: There might be multiple image links in a single line, so the parser must be able to extract multiple occurrences from a single line.\n\n5. **Non-Image Files**: The parser must distinguish between image files and non-image files, possibly based on file extensions, and only extract the former.\n\n6. **Escaping Characters**: Some characters in file names or paths may be escaped, and the parser must correctly interpret these.\n\n7. **Comments and Inactive Links**: ORG mode allows for comments and inactive links that are not meant to be parsed as active content. The parser must ignore these.\n\n8. **File Extension Case Sensitivity**: The parser should probably treat file extensions as case-insensitive to catch all image links (e.g., '.jpg' vs '.JPG').\n\n9. **Embedded Base64 Data**: Rarely, images could be embedded directly with Base64 data instead of linked as files. This would require special handling.\n\n10. **Links with Descriptions**: In ORG mode, links can have descriptions that may or may not include additional square brackets or other characters that could confuse a simple parser.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will be important for constructing a parser that can accurately extract image file names from an ORG file."
