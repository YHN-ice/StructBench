The parser must recognize all these formats.\n\n2. **Image file extensions**: There are multiple image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser must be able to identify all of them.\n\n3. **Relative vs absolute paths**: Images can be included using both relative and absolute paths. The parser must extract the file names regardless of the path format.\n\n4. **Link text and descriptions**: Sometimes images have descriptions or alternative text alongside them, which should not be confused with the file names.\n\n5. **Non-image links**: The ORG file might contain links to non-image files or URLs that should not be included in the output.\n\n6. **Multiple images on one line**: There could be lines with multiple image links, and the parser should be able to extract each image file name individually.\n\n7. **Escaped characters or special syntax**: In some cases, special syntax or escaped characters could be used in image links, which the parser needs to handle correctly.\n\n8. **Formatting inconsistencies**: The ORG file might have inconsistent formatting which could make it difficult for a simple pattern matching to work effectively.\n\nKeeping these potential difficulties in mind will help in creating a robust solution for parsing the ORG file and extracting all the image file names accurately.
