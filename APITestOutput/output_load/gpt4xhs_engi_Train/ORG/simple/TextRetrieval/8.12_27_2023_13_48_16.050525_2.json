Embedded images will not have typical file names.\n4. **Different Image Formats**: Images can come in various formats (e.g., jpg, png, gif, svg), so the parser has to recognize all possible image file extensions.\n5. **Non-standard Syntax**: If the ORG file has custom or non-standard syntax for embedding images, it could be difficult to extract these without specific rules.\n6. **Textual Noise**: Sometimes file names could be part of a larger text block or inline with text, making it more difficult to extract cleanly without additional context.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be equipped to handle the standard syntax for image inclusion in ORG files and be prepared to encounter and deal with a variety of situations accordingly."
