The parser must be able to recognize all the ways that images can be included.\n\n2. **Path Complexity**: Images could be included with relative or absolute paths, and the parser must be able to handle both. Furthermore, paths may include directories, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: There are various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser must account for all possible image file extensions when looking for image files.\n\n4. **Embedded Images**: Images may be embedded in the file rather than linked, and depending on the parsing technique, it might be more challenging to extract the actual file names of embedded images.\n\n5. **Image References Inside Comments or Inactive Blocks**: Sometimes images can be referenced inside comments or blocks that are not meant to be displayed (inactive blocks). The parser should decide whether to include or exclude these.\n\n6. **Link Descriptions**: ORG files allow for descriptive text to accompany links. The parser must distinguish between the link text and the actual link to the image file.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on One Line**: If multiple images are included on the same line, the parser will need to handle this without confusing parts of one file name with another.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might not consistently format their ORG files, leading to irregularities that the parser has to handle gracefully.\n\nTo accurately extract all image file names, the parser will have to successfully navigate these potential issues.
