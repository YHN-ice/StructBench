Image files often have common extensions such as .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. The parser needs rules to recognize these patterns.\n\n2. **Formatting Variations**: Images can be linked in various ways depending on the formatting used in the ORG file. For example, they might be included inline using links or they could be referenced as part of a list or a descriptive paragraph.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: The paths to the image files could be either relative to the location of the ORG file or absolute paths referencing a location on the filesystem or a URL. The parser should distinguish between these and extract accordingly.\n\n4. **Embedded Images**: If images are embedded in a different format (e.g., base64), it would be more complex to extract them, as they are not referenced by a traditional file path or URL.\n\n5. **Markup Syntax**: ORG files support rich text formatting with their own markup syntax. The parser must understand this syntax to accurately parse out the image file names.\n\n6. **External References**: If images are not included directly but rather linked to external sources (like a website), the parser needs to fetch the actual file names if required.\n\n7. **File Accessibility**: If the parser should verify the existence of the images, it might encounter permissions issues or broken links.\n\n8. **Encoding and Charset**: The encoding of the ORG file might affect how text is read, especially if there are non-standard characters in the image filenames.\n\nAfter considering these potential issues, you can now provide the ORG file for parsing, and I will proceed to extract all included image file names, keeping in mind the outlined difficulties."
