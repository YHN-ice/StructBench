Identifying and extracting filenames would generally apply to linked images, not embedded ones.\n\n4. **Variety of Image Extensions**: There are multiple image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), so the parser has to account for all possible image extensions.\n\n5. **Inline Text**: If image filenames are mixed with text, regex or parsing logic must be able to distinguish and isolate the filenames.\n\n6. **File Inclusion Syntax**: Depending on how images are included in the ORG file, there might be specific syntax used (like `[[file:imagename.jpg]]`), which needs to be understood for correct extraction.\n\n7. **Markup Characters**: Special characters or markup syntax around file names (like brackets or markup tags) need to be stripped to obtain clean filenames.\n\n8. **Repeated Filenames**: The same image might be included multiple times in the document; ensuring that each name is only listed once if required.\n\n9. **File Availability**: Extracting filenames doesn't ensure that the files are available; they might be missing or located on a remote server.\n\n10. **Malformed Links**: Some links might be broken or malformed, which could throw off a simple parsing algorithm.\n\nThese are some challenges that might be encountered.
