Identifying all the possible formats used for including images might require a comprehensive understanding of the ORG file syntax.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image files can be included using either relative or absolute paths. If the ORG file uses relative paths, it might be necessary to know the base path to correctly identify the image files.\n\n3. **Linked vs. Embedded Images**: Some ORG files might link to external image files, while others might contain embedded, base64-encoded images directly within the file. Extracting file names for embedded images might not be straightforward.\n\n4. **Multiple Inclusions**: The same image file might be included multiple times in the ORG file. Deciding whether to list duplicates or only unique instances could be a challenge.\n\n5. **Non-image File Links**: ORG files might also contain links to non-image files, so the parser would need to differentiate between image links and other types of links.\n\n6. **Comments and Inactive Links**: Images included in commented sections or as part of inactive links should probably not be counted, so the parser needs to be able to recognize and ignore such cases.\n\n7. **Image Formats**: Ensuring that the parser recognizes all possible image formats (e.g., jpg, png, gif, svg, etc.) is necessary to not miss any included image files.\n\n8. **ORG File Variants**: There might be variations in ORG file formatting and conventions, depending on the software used to create or edit them. The parser needs to handle these variations effectively.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file content so I can attempt to extract the included image file names."
