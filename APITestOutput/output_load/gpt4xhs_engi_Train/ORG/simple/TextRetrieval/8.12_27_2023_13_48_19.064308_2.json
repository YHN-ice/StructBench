The parser will need to understand all these variations.\n\n4. **Embedded Images:** If images are encoded and embedded directly into the ORG file (e.g., Base64), it might be more challenging to extract them as file names might not be present.\n\n5. **Image References within Text:** There is a possibility that image file names are mentioned within the text but not actually linked or included as images. The parser should distinguish between actual image links and plain text references.\n\n6. **Multiple References to the Same Image:** There could be multiple references to the same image file. The parser should decide whether to list duplicates or only unique instances.\n\n7. **Non-Standard Org File Content:** Custom user macros or shortcuts that are not part of standard Org-mode syntax could potentially contain image links that are not immediately recognizable without custom parsing rules.\n\n8. **Large Files and Performance:** If the ORG file is very large, performance could become an issue and may require efficient parsing strategies.\n\n9. **Errors in the ORG File:** There might be errors or typos in the file which could make it difficult to correctly parse without some form of error handling or correction mechanism.\n\nOnce I have access to the input ORG file, I'll be able to provide a more tailored response based on the content and structure of the file."
