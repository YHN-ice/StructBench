Some images may be linked directly, others embedded, and there could be variations in the markup syntax for including images.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images might have relative or absolute paths, and the parser needs to distinguish and extract these correctly.\n\n3. **Link Formats**: Images might be linked using various protocols (http, https, file, etc.), and the parser has to recognize and handle each accordingly.\n\n4. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Sometimes images might be included as base64 encoded data directly within the ORG file, which would require decoding to identify as images.\n\n5. **File Extensions**: Identifying image files typically relies on their extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), but there might be cases where the extension is not present or is non-standard, which could complicate extraction.\n\n6. **Non-Image Links**: An ORG file may contain links to other types of files or URLs that are not images, so the parser must differentiate between these and image links.\n\n7. **Comments and Inactive Links**: Images might be within comments or as inactive links, which may or may not be intended for extraction based on the requirements.\n\n8. **File Updates**: If an ORG file is updated after the knowledge cutoff date (in this case, 2023), the parser won't have access to the new content.\n\n9. **Multiline Links**: Sometimes an image link could be broken over multiple lines, which can complicate extraction as the parser needs to properly concatenate these lines.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, let's proceed with extracting the image files from the provided ORG file.
