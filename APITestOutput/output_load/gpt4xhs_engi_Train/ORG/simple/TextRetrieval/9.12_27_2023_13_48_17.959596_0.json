However, if other methods are used or if asterisks are used in a different context (not for bold), it could complicate the extraction process.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements (like italic, underline, code snippets, or links), which could make the extraction more complex.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape asterisks that are not meant to be interpreted as formatting, like `\\*not bold\\*`. Recognizing escaped characters and not treating them as formatting is necessary to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Asterisks in Code Blocks or Examples**: Asterisks used inside code blocks or example blocks should not be treated as bold formatting. Ensuring that the parser correctly identifies these blocks and does not apply formatting rules to them is important.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it might be challenging to ensure that all parts of the text are captured as part of the same bold section.\n\n6. **Asterisk Usage in Lists or Headings**: In ORG files, asterisks are also used for lists or defining headings. The parser will need to distinguish between these uses and the bold formatting.\n\nUnderstanding and accounting for these complexities is crucial for accurately extracting all bold texts from the ORG file. Once I see the ORG file input, I'll attempt to parse it according to the usual conventions while keeping these potential issues in mind."
