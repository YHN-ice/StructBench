Here are some potential obstacles and difficulties that might arise when parsing an ORG file to extract bold text:\n\n1. **Different Formatting for Bold Text**:\n   - Bold text in ORG files is typically denoted with asterisks, e.g., `*text*`. However, different versions or configurations could use alternative markers.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**:\n   - Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underline, or code blocks, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **False Positives from Other Asterisk Uses**:\n   - Asterisks are also used for bullet points and section headings in ORG files. These should not be confused with bold text.\n\n4. **Line Breaks and Multiline Bold Text**:\n   - Bold phrases may span across multiple lines, which can make it challenging to capture the entire content if the parser expects single-line formatting.\n\n5. **Link Descriptions**:\n   - ORG files support links that can also contain bold text within their description. Parsing these correctly may require additional logic.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**:\n   - There could be escaped asterisks within the text that should not be interpreted as bold formatting.\n\n7. **Complex Documents Structure**:\n   - ORG files can contain a hierarchy of headings and subheadings, making it challenging to determine the scope of where to look for bold text.\n\n8. **Performance and Scalability**:\n   - For large files, efficiency becomes a concern. The parser must be able to handle large documents without significant performance degradation.\n\nEach of these points can potentially cause complications when trying to accurately extract bold text from an ORG file. The parsing algorithm must be robust enough to handle these cases appropriately."
