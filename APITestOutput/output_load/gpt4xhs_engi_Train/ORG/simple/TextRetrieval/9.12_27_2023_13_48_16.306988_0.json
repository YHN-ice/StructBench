This could lead to excessive text being extracted or missing out on some bold text.\n\n6. **Embedded Code Blocks or Examples**: Bold text within code blocks or example blocks should be treated differently as they may follow different syntax rules.\n\n7. **File Size and Complexity**: A large ORG file with a complex structure could make parsing slower and more error-prone.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll need to carefully apply parsing logic that takes these potential issues into account to ensure accurate extraction of the bold texts."
