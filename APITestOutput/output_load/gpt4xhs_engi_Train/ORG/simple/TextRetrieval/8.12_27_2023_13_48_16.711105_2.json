It's necessary to recognize all possible image formats.\n\n2. **Inline or Block Images:** Images in ORG files can be included inline with text or as separate blocks. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n3. **Link Formats:** Images may be included using different link formats or syntax (e.g., file links, URLs). The parser needs to identify and properly handle these formats to extract the actual file names.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths:** Image paths might be given as absolute or relative paths, and the parser may have to normalize these paths to extract only the file name.\n\n5. **Markup Variability:** Images might be included with additional markup for captions, attributes, etc. The parser should not be confused by this extra information.\n\n6. **File Name Escaping:** Any special characters in file names that are escaped or encoded in the ORG file need to be properly interpreted.\n\n7. **Large Files and Performance:** If the ORG file is very large, performance considerations might come into play when parsing the file.\n\n8. **Embedded vs Linked Images:** Some images might be embedded directly in the ORG file in base64 or similar formats rather than linked as separate files.\n\n9. **Comments and Non-image Links:** There may be non-image file links or comments that could be mistaken for image files. These need to be distinguished from actual image links.\n\n10. **Syntactical Ambiguities:** The ORG file syntax might have ambiguities that could lead to false positives or negatives when identifying image files.\n\nEach of these points needs careful attention when developing a robust ORG file parser.
