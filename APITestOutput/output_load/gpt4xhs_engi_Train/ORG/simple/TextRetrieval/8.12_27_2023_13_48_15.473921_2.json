The parser must correctly identify and differentiate between these formats.\n\n3. **Embedded vs. Linked**: Images could either be embedded directly within the ORG file (less common) or more likely linked to files stored elsewhere. The parser needs to focus on extracting linked file names rather than attempting to parse embedded image data.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in an ORG file could be referenced using relative or absolute paths. The parser should be able to handle both types of paths.\n\n5. **Markup Variability**: Image references could be part of complex markup constructs, such as wrapped within other elements (like links within lists or tables), which may add complexity to the parsing.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: The parser must recognize various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and not confuse them with other non-image file types.\n\n7. **Comments and Non-Image Links**: The parser will need to ignore non-image links and commented-out text that may contain what appears to be image file names.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There might be multiple images referenced on a single line, which requires the parser to extract all valid references without mistakes.\n\n9. **Escape Characters and Special Syntax**: The ORG file might contain escape characters or special syntax that could alter how text is interpreted, potentially complicating the extraction process.\n\n10. **Non-Standard Inclusions**: Users might have used non-standard methods to include images, such as custom macros or scripts, which may not adhere to the typical ORG mode syntax.\n\nDespite these potential obstacles, with the correct parsing logic and patterns for image file recognition, it should be possible to extract the list of included image filenames from an ORG file.
