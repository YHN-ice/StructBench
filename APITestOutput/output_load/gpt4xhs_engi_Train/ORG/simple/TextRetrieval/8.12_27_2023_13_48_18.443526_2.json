Parsing these different path styles correctly could be challenging.\n\n3. **Multiple Images per Line**: There may be multiple images included on a single line, which requires careful parsing to extract each one individually.\n\n4. **Non-image File Links**: The ORG file might contain links to non-image files as well, and the parser should distinguish between image and non-image file links.\n\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images may not always be linked as separate files; they could be embedded directly in the ORG file as Base64 data, which would not correspond to a separate image filename.\n\n6. **Commented or Inactive Links**: Some image links might be commented out or marked as inactive, and depending on the requirements, the parser may need to ignore these.\n\n7. **Formatting Variations**: Due to user editing or different versions of ORG mode, there may be slight variations in how images are included, which can complicate pattern matching.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, the parser would need to systematically address these challenges to accurately extract and list the image filenames."
