Format Variability: ORG files can include images in various ways using links or literal examples. The parser must identify all possible syntaxes used to include images.\n\n2. Relative vs Absolute Paths: Image files could be referenced via relative or absolute paths. The parser must correctly interpret these paths to identify the file names.\n\n3. Embedded vs Linked Images: Images can be embedded directly in an ORG file or linked from external sources. For linked images, the parser needs to differentiate between local and remote links.\n\n4. File Extensions: There are many image file formats, each with its own extension (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). The parser must recognize all possible image file extensions.\n\n5. Inline Markup: ORG files may include markup that could be part of an image link, such as caption text or attributes. The parser must extract the file name without including any surrounding markup.\n\n6. Multiple References: An image file might be included multiple times within the document. The parser should decide whether to list duplicates or only unique filenames.\n\n7. Encrypted or Obfuscated Links: In some cases, image links could be encrypted or obfuscated to prevent direct access, making it difficult to extract the plain file names.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will attempt to address these challenges and extract the image file names according to your request."
