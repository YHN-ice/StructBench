Sometimes image links may be straightforward, while other times they might be embedded within descriptive texts or links.\n\n2. **Image References Versus Embeds**: Distinguishing between actual embedded images and mere references to images that aren't actually included in the document could be challenging.\n\n3. **Path Complexity**: Images might be linked with relative or absolute paths, and the paths could be complex with directories, subdirectories, or even external URLs.\n\n4. **File Type Recognition**: Identifying what constitutes an 'image file' based on extensions might require a predefined list of acceptable image formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif).\n\n5. **Link Syntax Variations**: ORG mode supports linking to images with different syntaxes, so the parser must recognize all possible variations.\n\n6. **Multi-line Links**: In some cases, links might be broken up over multiple lines for formatting reasons, which could complicate pattern recognition.\n\n7. **Markup and Comment Blocks**: Images might be included within markup or comment blocks, which could require additional logic to handle correctly.\n\n8. **File Name Encoding**: Special characters in file names may be encoded or escaped in various ways within the ORG document, which will need to be correctly interpreted.\n\nTo address these potential obstacles, the parsing logic should be robust and flexible enough to handle various inclusion patterns and edge cases. Now, please provide the ORG file content so I can extract the image file names."
