The parser needs to correctly identify the file names in both cases.\n\n3. **Multiple Images on a Single Line:** There could be lines with multiple image links. The parser should be able to extract multiple file names from a single line.\n\n4. **Non-Image Files**: The parser must differentiate between image files and other types of files (like .doc, .pdf, .txt) and ensure only image file names are extracted.\n\n5. **Diverse Image Extensions:** There are many possible image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp). The parser should recognize all possible image extensions.\n\n6. **Misleading Filenames:** Sometimes non-image files may have misleading extensions (like an executable with a .jpg extension), which can't be distinguished based on name alone.\n\n7. **Textual Representation of File Paths:** Some file paths might include spaces or special characters that are represented differently in text, which the parser must correctly interpret.\n\n8. **Comments and Metadata:** ORG files can include comments and metadata that might contain strings resembling image file paths.
