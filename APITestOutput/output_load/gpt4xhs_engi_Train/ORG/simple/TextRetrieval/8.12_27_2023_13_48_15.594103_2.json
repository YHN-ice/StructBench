The parser must recognize all the possible ways images can be embedded.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be included using either relative or absolute paths. The parser should correctly identify the file names regardless of the path used.\n\n3. **Linked vs Embedded Images**: Images could be directly embedded or linked from external resources. The parser might need to differentiate between the two.\n\n4. **File Name Formats**: Image file names can have various formats and extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and some file names might include spaces or special characters that need to be handled properly.\n\n5. **Commented or Inactive Code**: Sometimes, image links might be commented out or placed in sections of the ORG file that are not meant to be active content. The parser must distinguish between active and inactive image references.\n\n6. **Complex ORG Structures**: ORG files can include complex structures like drawers, blocks, and inline code, which may obscure image references.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in preparing a parser that can accurately extract image file names from an ORG file.
