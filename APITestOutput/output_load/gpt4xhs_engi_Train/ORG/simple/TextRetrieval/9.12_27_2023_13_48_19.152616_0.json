We need to distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: The bold text might span multiple lines, so the parsing logic must be able to handle multi-line patterns if they are allowed in the file's syntax for bold text.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks that are part of the content but not meant to indicate bold text could be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), and the parser should not consider these as bold.\n\n6. **Whitespace Handling**: There might be whitespace variations around the asterisks that should be correctly handled.\n\n7. **Special Cases**: There could be special cases like bold text immediately following a heading or embedded inside a link description.\n\n8. **File Size and Encoding**: Large files and different file encodings might also pose a challenge for efficient parsing.\n\nDepending on the input file we receive and the rules it follows, we'll need to address these challenges accordingly in order to accurately extract all bold text."
