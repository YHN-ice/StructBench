They might be directly included with a link, or they may be referenced in a more complex structure that includes descriptive text or additional attributes.\n\n2. **File Extensions**: It's possible that the file extensions for the images could vary. They might be traditional ones like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc., but could also include less common ones or even custom extensions.\n\n3. **Inline Images Versus Attachments**: Images might be embedded directly within the content or attached and referenced by a link. The parser will have to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Hidden or Encoded Links**: Sometimes, image links might not be straightforward. They could be partially encoded, obfuscated, or hidden within another element, requiring a more in-depth parsing process.\n\n5. **Non-Image Links**: The ORG file may contain other types of links that are not images. The parser needs to distinguish between image files and other types of files or URLs.\n\n6. **Relative versus Absolute Paths**: Image links could be given in relative or absolute paths. The parser needs to properly extract just the file names in both cases.\n\n7. **Textual Noise**: There may be additional non-image text or markup that could interfere with the simple extraction of image file names.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser would need to have a robust pattern matching system, likely utilizing regular expressions or some form of syntax analysis specific to ORG files, and it would need to have logic to handle the different ways images might be included in the document."
