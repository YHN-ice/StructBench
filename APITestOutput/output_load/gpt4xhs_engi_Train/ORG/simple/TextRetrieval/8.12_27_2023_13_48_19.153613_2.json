For example, they could be embedded with different markdown tags or formats.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: The image files might be included with relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs. Parsing these correctly would be necessary to identify the file names.\n\n3. **Different image formats**: Images could be in various formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and I would need to recognize all possible image extensions to extract them correctly.\n\n4. **Comments or non-image links**: Some links might be commented out or could be links to non-image files. I would need to distinguish between actual image file links and other content.\n\n5. **Multi-line links**: In some cases, the link to an image file might be broken up across multiple lines. Handling line continuations would be necessary to accurately parse these links.\n\n6. **Embedded vs linked images**: Images may be embedded directly in the file in base64 encoding or simply linked by a file path or URL. Embedded images would require a different approach to extract their file names.\n\n7. **Special characters**: File names may include special characters or spaces which could complicate parsing.\n\n8. **Encrypted or obfuscated image names**: If the image names are somehow encrypted or obfuscated, it may be difficult to extract them without knowing the method used.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll be able to determine if any of these potential difficulties and obstacles are present and devise a strategy to deal with them accordingly."
