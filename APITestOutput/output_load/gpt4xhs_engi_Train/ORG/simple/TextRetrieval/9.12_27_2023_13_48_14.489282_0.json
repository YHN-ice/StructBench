Typically, bold text in ORG is wrapped with asterisks, like `*bold*`.\n\n2. **Variations in Formatting**: Bold text might not always be cleanly formatted. There might be variations such as spaces within the asterisks, like `* bold *`, or nested formatting, where bold text is inside other formatting like italic or underlined text.\n\n3. **Handling Multiple Lines**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which can complicate parsing as we would need to maintain state across line breaks.\n\n4. **Special Cases Handling**: There might be escaped asterisks or other characters that look like formatting but are actually part of the content. We would need to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n5. **Mixed Content**: Bold text could be mixed with other types of content, such as links, code snippets, or inline images, and these might need to be handled or ignored appropriately.\n\n6. **Consistency in Output**: Since we want to print out the raw bold texts separated by newlines (`\\n`), we must ensure that the parser consistently extracts the text and handles edge cases like trailing spaces, punctuation, or line breaks within the bolded sections.\n\nThese potential issues would need to be taken into account when creating a robust ORG file parser for extracting bold texts."
