Ensuring the parser recognizes all possible syntaxes is essential.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked with relative or absolute paths, and the parser must correctly identify and extract the file names from both.\n\n3. **Embedded vs. External Images**: Images may be embedded directly into the ORG file in base64 or linked externally. The parser needs to distinguish between these cases.\n\n4. **Hidden or Commented Image Links**: Sometimes images might be included within comments or in a way that they are not displayed; deciding whether to include these might be necessary.\n\n5. **Markup variations**: Org files can contain a lot of markup, and images could be a part of a complex markup structure that needs to be navigated.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file content so I can identify and extract the image file names."
