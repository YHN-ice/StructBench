However, it's important to account for possible variations or errors in markup, such as missing asterisks or additional spaces that could affect the detection of bold text.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italic, underlined, or code blocks. This requires careful parsing to ensure that only the bold text is extracted and that other formatting is not mistaken for bold.\n\n3. **Escaped asterisks**: Asterisks used for other purposes or escaped asterisks (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`) should not be considered as denoting bold text.\n\n4. **Line breaks and whitespace**: Line breaks or additional whitespace near the asterisks could complicate the detection of bold text, especially if they occur within a bold phrase.\n\n5. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which requires a parser to handle line continuations properly.\n\n6. **Special characters**: The presence of special characters within bold text might require additional handling to ensure they are included in the extracted output.\n\n7. **File encoding and formatting**: The ORG file encoding and formatting should be properly handled to ensure accurate parsing of the content.\n\nThese potential issues would need to be addressed in the logic of an ORG file parser to accurately extract all bold texts from an ORG file.
