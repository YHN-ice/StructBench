Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might come up when trying to extract all included image file names from an ORG file:\n\n1. **Identification of Image Links**: The ORG file format supports linking to images, but the way images are included can vary. The parser needs to correctly identify all the different formats for image inclusion.\n\n2. **Various Link Formats**: Images might be linked with a variety of syntaxes, such as direct paths, URLs, or using ORG mode specific link formatting. The parser needs to recognize all these formats.\n\n3. **Inline vs Block Images**: Images can be included inline within text or as standalone blocks. Each type might have different syntax that needs to be accounted for.\n\n4. **Syntax Variations**: There could be minor variations in how links are formatted (e.g., differing amounts of whitespace, use of different brackets or markup characters, etc.).\n\n5. **Non-Image File Links**: The document might contain links to non-image files or external resources which should not be confused with image files.\n\n6. **File Path Ambiguities**: Relative paths might be used, and without knowing the ORG file's location, it might be difficult to determine the exact file location.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Not all image files may have standard image extensions (like .jpg, .png, etc.), so we need a reliable way to determine which files are indeed images.\n\n8. **Markup and Comments**: Some image links might be commented out or included in sections that are not meant to be parsed (like code blocks), which the parser should ideally ignore.\n\n9. **Textual Content**: The ORG file is primarily a text file, and there might be regular text that resembles an image link but isn't (like example text).\n\n10. **File Encoding**: If the ORG file has a non-standard encoding, it might affect the parsing process.\n\nBy identifying these potential obstacles beforehand, we can develop strategies to mitigate them when extracting image file names from the ORG file input."
