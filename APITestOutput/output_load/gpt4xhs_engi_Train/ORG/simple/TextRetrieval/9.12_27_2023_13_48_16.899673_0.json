This requires careful parsing to ensure the bold text is extracted without including other formatting.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Asterisks used in a non-formatting context could be escaped, such as `\\(asterisk)text\\(asterisk)` which should not be interpreted as bold. The parser must distinguish these cases.\n\n4. **Line Breaks**: The bold text might span multiple lines, which can be challenging to handle if the parser expects inline formatting only.\n\n5. **Special Org Mode Syntax**: ORG mode has its special syntax elements like headlines, lists, links, etc., which may interfere with the straightforward parsing of bold texts.\n\n6. **File Size and Complexity**: Large files with complex structures may slow down the parsing process and increase the difficulty of correctly extracting the bold texts.\n\n7. **Version Differences**: Different versions of ORG mode might have different syntax rules or additional formatting options that could affect how bold text is marked.\n\nOnce we receive the input file, we will apply a suitable parsing strategy that accounts for these potential difficulties to accurately extract and print all raw texts that are formatted as bold, separated by a newline character."
