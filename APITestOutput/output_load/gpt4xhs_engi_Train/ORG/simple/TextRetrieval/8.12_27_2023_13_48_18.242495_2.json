You need to identify all possible syntaxes that can include an image, such as `[[file:image.jpg]]`, `[[./image.jpg]]`, or even HTML tags if HTML is embedded within the ORG document.\n\n2. **Path variations**: Images can be included with relative paths, absolute paths, or even URLs. You need to recognize all these possibilities and correctly extract just the file name when needed.\n\n3. **Image formats**: There are many image file formats (like JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, etc.), and the parser must be able to recognize all the formats that could be included in the document.\n\n4. **Non-image links**: The ORG file may contain links to non-image files or URLs. The parser must distinguish between image and non-image links.\n\n5. **Textual noise**: There might be additional text or markup around the image links that could make it harder to isolate the actual file names.\n\n6. **File name extraction**: Once a link is identified as an image link, you need to correctly parse out just the file name and not any surrounding text or markup.\n\n7. **Repeated file names**: The ORG file may include the same image multiple times. Depending on what's needed, you may choose to list each instance or ignore duplicates.\n\n8. **In-line images vs. display images**: ORG mode allows for both inline display of images and links meant for clicking through. These might be handled differently in the document.\n\nRecognizing and addressing these potential difficulties will help ensure that your parsing process accurately extracts all included image files from the ORG file provided."
