It's possible that images are linked or embedded in different ways, so the parser must be able to handle all potential formats.\n\n2. **Link variations:** Images could be linked with full URLs, relative paths, or using various Org mode link types (like file, http, https). There might also be shortcuts or macros used that need to be interpreted correctly to identify image files.\n\n3. **Embedded Base64 images:** Sometimes images are embedded directly into the file as Base64 encoded strings. Identifying and extracting these would require decoding and possibly saving them as separate image files.\n\n4. **Hidden or commented out links:** Links to images may be commented out or included in a way that they are not meant to be parsed (e.g., within code blocks or example blocks).\n\n5. **File existence verification:** If the requirement is not just to list the image filenames but also to verify their existence, the parser would need file system access which might not always be possible or allowed.\n\n6. **Complexity within Org-mode constructs:** Org-mode allows for complex constructs like tables, drawers, and macros, which could complicate the parsing logic.\n\n7. **Special Org-mode properties:** Some images might be included through special properties or setup options at the top of the file, which need to be understood and parsed.\n\n8. **External file inclusion:** Org-mode supports including content from external files which might contain image links. The parser must decide whether to follow and parse these external files as well.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges would help in designing a robust parser that can accurately extract all included image file names from an ORG file."
