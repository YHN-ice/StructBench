We need to be aware of all these formats.\n2. **Variety of Image Extensions**: There could be multiple image file formats included in the ORG file, such as .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. We need to ensure that we recognize and extract all possible image formats.\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: The images could be referenced by absolute paths or relative paths. If it's a relative path, additional context may be required to determine the actual location of the image files.\n4. **Link Description**: Sometimes the actual link to the image file might be accompanied by a description which could potentially include text that looks like a file name.\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images**: In some cases, images might be embedded directly in the ORG file as Base64 encoded strings rather than file paths.\n6. **Comments and Non-image Links**: We need to distinguish between actual image links and other links or commented lines that might contain image file names but aren't actually including an image.\n7. **Complex Markup**: ORG files may contain complex markup, macros, or special blocks that could obscure or complicate the parsing of image filenames.\n\nTo work around these obstacles, we'll need to develop a robust parsing strategy that can account for these variations and accurately identify image file names within the text.
