In ORG mode, bold text is often denoted by surrounding the text with asterisks. For example, a bold text would appear like this in the raw file: `*bold text*`\n\nHowever, there can be several potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Ambiguity with Headings**: ORG files use asterisks for headings as well. A single asterisk followed by a space denotes a top-level heading. So it is important to distinguish between headings and bold text.\n\n2. **Asterisks within Text**: There can be instances where asterisks are used within the text for other purposes, such as denoting footnotes or in lists, which should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n3. **Line Breaks**: The bold text may span multiple lines, and we need to ensure that the line breaks do not interfere with the extraction of bolded text.\n\n4. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested with other formatting such as italic, underlined, or code. Parsing nested formatting correctly can be challenging.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: Escaped characters or special symbols within the bolded section could complicate the parsing logic.\n\n6. **Incorrect Formatting**: Sometimes users may incorrectly format the bold text (e.g., missing an asterisk at the end), which could lead to incorrect or incomplete extractions.\n\n7. **Variations in Formatting**: Some users may use variations of formatting (like different numbers of asterisks) which are not standard and could be missed by a parser looking for standard patterns.\n\nFor an accurate extraction, the parser must account for these complexities and correctly identify the patterns that represent bold text while ignoring false positives. Once the bold texts are identified, they can be extracted and printed as separate lines as requested."
