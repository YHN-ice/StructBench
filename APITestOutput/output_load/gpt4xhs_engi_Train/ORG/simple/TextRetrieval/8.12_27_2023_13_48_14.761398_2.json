Multiple Formats: Images could be in different formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and I need to ensure that I can recognize all the common image file types.\n\n3. Inline Images vs Attachments: Images can be included inline within the text or as attachments. I must handle both cases.\n\n4. Relative vs Absolute Paths: Image paths can be either relative to the ORG file or absolute paths referring to a location on the system or the web. I need to correctly interpret these paths.\n\n5. Links with Descriptions: Sometimes, links to images might have descriptions or additional text that need to be parsed out to properly extract just the file names.\n\n6. Complex Markup: The image links might be part of more complex markup, such as being inside tables, lists, or other formatting structures, which could make extraction more challenging.\n\n7. Variations in Syntax: Different versions of ORG mode or user customization might lead to variations in how images are embedded, necessitating a flexible parsing approach.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, I would need to carefully parse the content, handle different link formats, and ensure that I extract only the file names of the images without any additional markup or text.
