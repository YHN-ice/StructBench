Typically, bold text is denoted by wrapping the text with asterisks (*), like `*this is bold*`, but this can be different if the user has customized the markup.\n\n2. Inline formatting: Bold text can be part of a line with other text and formatting. This means the parser must correctly distinguish and extract only the bold parts without including other text or formatting characters.\n\n3. Nested formatting: There could be nested formatting within bold text, such as italicized words or links. The parser must handle these cases without disrupting the extraction of the bold text.\n\n4. Multi-line bold text: Sometimes bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser should be capable of handling such situations without breaking the extracted text at line boundaries (unless that's intended).\n\n5. Escaped characters: Users might escape asterisks to use them as literal characters instead of formatting indicators, which means not all asterisk-wrapped text is necessarily bold.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it's important to have a clear understanding of the specific syntax rules for bold text in the ORG file provided and to handle edge cases appropriately during parsing."
