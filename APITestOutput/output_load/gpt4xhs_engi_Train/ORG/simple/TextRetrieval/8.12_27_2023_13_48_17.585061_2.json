The parser must handle all these cases.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images might be referenced using relative paths, absolute paths, or even URLs. The parser must correctly identify and possibly resolve these paths to determine the file names.\n\n4. **Markup Complexity**: ORG files can contain complex structures like headings, lists, and blocks that might complicate the extraction process if images are nested within them.\n\n5. **Image Formats**: There could be various image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.), and the parser should recognize all possible image file extensions.\n\n6. **Escape Characters or Commented Lines**: Some image references might be commented out or escape characters may be used. The parser should discern whether to include or exclude these.\n\n7. **File Availability**: Extracting the file name does not guarantee that the file is present at the given path; it just means that there is a reference to it.\n\n8. **Duplicate Names**: There might be references to images with the same name but located in different directories.

        "To extract the image file names, we can use a simple regular expression that looks for the pattern `[[` followed by any characters and ending with a `]]` that is common for embedded or linked images in ORG files.
