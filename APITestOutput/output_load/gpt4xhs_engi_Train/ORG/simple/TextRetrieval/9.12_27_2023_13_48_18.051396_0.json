Markup Variability: ORG files can include bold text marked up in different ways, such as with asterisks (*) or with specific markup commands. It's essential to know all the possible markup patterns that denote bold text.\n\n2. Nested Formatting: Bold text can be nested within other formatting options, like italic, underlined, or code blocks. Parsing needs to account for these nested scenarios without incorrectly interpreting the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. Inline Formatting: Bold text could be part of a longer line of text, with non-bold text before and after it. The parser must be able to isolate the bold pieces without including adjacent text.\n\n4. Multiline Bold Text: If bold text spans multiple lines, the parser should be able to recognize the continuation of the bold formatting across line breaks if that's supported by the ORG markup.\n\n5. Special Characters: Special characters within bold text may interfere with parsing if they coincide with markup symbols. The parser must handle such cases correctly.\n\n6. Escaped Markup: Occasionally, users may escape formatting characters to display them literally. The parser will need to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters that aren't meant to format the text.\n\n7. Sections and Headings: The parser should not confuse bold text with section or heading markers, which might also use asterisks or similar symbols in ORG files.\n\nTo properly address these issues, the parsing logic should be robust, flexible, and capable of handling a variety of ORG file idiosyncrasies. Once I see the input file, I'll apply the necessary rules to extract all bold texts accurately."
