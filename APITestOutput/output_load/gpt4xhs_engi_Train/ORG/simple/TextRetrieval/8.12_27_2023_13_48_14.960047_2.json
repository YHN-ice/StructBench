There might be relative or absolute paths that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n3. **Multiple Inclusion Formats**: Some images might be included for different purposes, such as for export (`#+ATTR_HTML: :src image.jpg`), which could alter the way they are referenced in the document.\n\n4. **Non-image File References**: The ORG file may contain file references that are not image files, so the parser must differentiate between image and non-image files.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Code**: The ORG file might contain commented code or inactive blocks that include image file references which are not intended to be active parts of the document.\n\n6. **Embedded Data Images**: Images may also be included as embedded data (Base64 encoded), which doesn't have a traditional filename but is still an image within the document.\n\nTo give the correct answer, the ORG file parser would need to correctly identify and handle all these potential issues, extracting only the actual image file names used in the document."
