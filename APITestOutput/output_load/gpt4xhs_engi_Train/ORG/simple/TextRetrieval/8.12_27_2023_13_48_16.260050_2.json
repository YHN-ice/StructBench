This could complicate the extraction if the parser does not account for both.\n\n4. **Inclusion within different org elements:** Image links could be part of different org elements such as headers, lists, tables, or plain text paragraphs. The parser must handle all these cases.\n\n5. **Text that looks like images but isn't:** There might be text that resembles an image file path or URL but isn't intended to be an image link. For example, example paths or URLs used in code blocks or examples.\n\n6. **Line breaks and formatting:** The ORG file could have line breaks or formatting that obfuscates the image links, making them harder to identify without proper parsing logic.\n\n7. **Comments and non-displayed text:** Images may be commented out or included in a way that they're not displayed when the ORG file is rendered. Depending on the requirements, these may or may not need to be extracted.\n\n8. **External resources requiring download:** Some images might be linked to external resources, which would require an internet connection and potentially downloading the images to get their file names.\n\nThese are just a few possible challenges that could arise.
