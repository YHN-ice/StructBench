In ORG mode, bold text is typically wrapped with asterisks `*` like `*bold text*`. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might occur:\n\n1. **Variants of markup syntax:** Ensuring that we correctly recognize all ways in which bold text can be represented in ORG files while not confusing it with other formatting or bullet lists which also use asterisks.\n\n2. **Inline formatting:** Bold text might be mixed with other formatting (like italic or underline) or embedded in regular text. This requires careful parsing to extract only the bold parts.\n\n3. **Special characters:** Special or escaped characters within the bold text could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Nested formatting:** Bold text can have other formatting nested inside it, such as `*bold _italic_*` which would require handling nested parsing correctly.\n\n5. **Partial formatting:** Partially formed bold syntax, where the user may have forgotten to close the bold formatting with asterisks, can lead to incorrect or incomplete extractions.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text:** Bold text that spans multiple lines may require handling line breaks and continuity of the bold format across those lines.\n\n7. **Code blocks and examples:** Ensuring that the parser does not mistakenly extract bold text from code blocks or examples where the asterisks are meant to be taken literally and are not formatting.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to carefully define the rules for recognizing bold text, likely using regular expressions or a parsing library that understands ORG mode's syntax, and account for edge cases in the ORG file content."
