This additional markup would need to be accounted for or stripped out to extract just the raw bold text.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as for list items or headings. Parsing logic needs to be careful to differentiate between these uses and actual bold text.\n\n4. **Multiline Text**: Bold text may span multiple lines, so the parser would need to handle multiline patterns appropriately.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks that are meant to be displayed as literal asterisks (and not as formatting) will be escaped (e.g., \\*), so the parser must distinguish between escaped and unescaped asterisks.\n\n6. **Consistency in Parsing**: Ensuring consistency across different ORG files which might have slightly different formatting rules or conventions.\n\n7. **Performance**: If the ORG file is very large, parsing performance could become an issue, particularly if using regular expressions or similar pattern-matching techniques.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a parser must apply a context-aware approach to accurately identify bold text and be robust enough to handle the intricacies of the markup within ORG files."
