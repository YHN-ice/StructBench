The parser must handle all these variations correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting markers (like italic, underline, etc.), which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Partial Bold Text**: Sometimes only part of a text line might be bold, requiring the parser to only extract that specific part without including non-bold text.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: The content within the bold text might include special characters or escape sequences that have to be handled correctly.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Markup**: If the markup is not used consistently or correctly (e.g., missing closing markers), it may be difficult to determine which text is supposed to be bold.\n\n6. **Contextual Meaning**: The parser needs to understand the context of the bold text — whether it's a header, emphasized text within a paragraph, or a list item.\n\n7. **Differentiating Headers from Bold Text**: In ORG files, headers are often marked with asterisks as well, so distinguishing between headers and bold text is essential.\n\n8. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it adds complexity to the extraction as the parser needs to recognize continuation lines.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be robust and flexible enough to accurately extract bold text from the ORG file input it receives."
