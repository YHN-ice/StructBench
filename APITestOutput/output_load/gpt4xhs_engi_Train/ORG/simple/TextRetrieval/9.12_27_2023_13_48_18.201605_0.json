In ORG files, bold text is typically surrounded by asterisks, like this: *bold text*. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. It's important to correctly parse the bold text without including other formatting markers.\n\n2. **Special characters**: If the bold text includes special characters or symbols that are also used as formatting markers (like asterisks), it might complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Inconsistent formatting**: Users might not consistently follow the syntax for bold text, which could lead to missed extractions or false positives.\n\n4. **Multiple bold segments**: An ORG file might contain multiple bold texts scattered throughout the document. Extracting all of them requires parsing the entire document and not just a specific section.\n\n5. **Escaped formatting**: Sometimes, asterisks meant to be displayed as literal asterisks can be escaped with backslashes or other methods, which means they should not be considered as bold markers.\n\n6. **Contextual understanding**: Bold text might be part of a larger structure, such as a list, table, or headline, and without proper handling, the context might be lost during extraction.\n\nTo give a correct answer, the parser must correctly interpret the ORG file's syntax and extract only the content intended to be in bold while addressing all listed obstacles effectively. Please provide the ORG file content to proceed with the extraction of bold texts."
