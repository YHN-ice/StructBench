The parser must handle these correctly to extract the intended subsection without losing any formatting that is part of the content.\n\n3. **Embedded Content:** Sections can contain various types of content, such as text, links, lists, and possibly code blocks. The parser should be able to distinguish between the section headings and the content.\n\n4. **Nested Structure:** Subsections can be nested within sections, and the parser must correctly navigate this structure to find the first subsection under the first section.\n\n5. **Indexing:** Understanding that indices are typically 0-based in programming but may be considered 1-based in human terms. The parser should interpret \"1th subsection under 1th section\" correctly according to the context.\n\n6. **Content Capture:** Capturing only the content of the specified subsection without bleeding into adjacent sections or subsections.\n\n7. **Error Handling:** Gracefully handling errors or unexpected formats in the ORG file that might not strictly adhere to expected standards.\n\n8. **State Management:** Keeping track of the current position within the file to ensure that the correct subsection is being extracted.\n\nIf these issues are addressed properly, the parser should be able to extract the requested content accurately.
