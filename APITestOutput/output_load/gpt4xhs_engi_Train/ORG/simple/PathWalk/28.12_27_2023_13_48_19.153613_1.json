If the file is not properly formatted, it may be difficult to discern the structure.\n\n3. **Large Content**: If the subsection has a lot of content or includes further nested subsections, it might be challenging to extract only the relevant part without additional context.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: ORG files can include special characters or markup that could affect how the content is parsed or displayed.\n\n5. **Embedded Code or Links**: If the subsection contains links, code blocks, or other embedded content, these might need special handling to be represented correctly in the output.\n\n6. **Incomplete Information**: If the ORG file content provided is incomplete or cuts off part of the section or subsection in question, it may not be possible to provide a complete answer.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, clear instructions and a complete representation of the content are necessary.
