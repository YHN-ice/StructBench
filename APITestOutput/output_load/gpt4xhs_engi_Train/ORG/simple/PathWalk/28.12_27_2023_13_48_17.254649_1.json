Similar Headings: If there are multiple sections with similar or identical headings, it can be challenging to ensure that we're looking at the correct section.\n\n3. Formatting Variations: ORG files can contain various formatting elements such as bold, italic, underlined text, links, or code blocks. Preserving the original formatting in the output requires careful handling.\n\n4. Incomplete Information: If the ORG file is incomplete or sections are not clearly defined, it may be difficult to identify the first subsection of the first section.\n\n5. Embedded Content: Subsections can contain lists, tables, or even embedded code blocks that need to be accurately represented in the excerpt.\n\n6. Large Files: If the ORG file is very large, navigating to the correct location could be cumbersome and time-consuming.\n\nEach of these potential obstacles would require its own strategy to overcome, with careful attention to the syntax and structure of ORG files.
