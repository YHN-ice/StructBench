Parsing the correct level of hierarchy to extract the content of a specific section requires careful navigation through the file.\n\n2. **Ambiguous Section References**: Without a clear numbering system or unique identifiers for the sections, determining which is the \"1th\" section could be ambiguous, especially if there's a title section or preface that is not considered a numbered section.\n\n3. **Variations in Formatting**: Different users might have personal preferences for formatting their ORG files. This can include variations in how headings are denoted, such as using different numbers of asterisks or varying conventions for numbering sections.\n\n4. **Embedded Content**: ORG files can contain links, lists, code blocks, tables, and other embedded content that could complicate extracting plain text.\n\n5. **Lack of Context**: Without seeing the actual structure of the ORG file, it is difficult to provide an accurate answer. The parser needs to understand the context of how the sections are organized.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the ORG file contains special characters or is encoded in a non-standard way, it could create parsing issues.\n\n7. **Programming Limitations**: If the parser is a simple text-based system without the ability to interpret the meaning behind the text (e.g., distinguishing between a heading and regular text), extracting the correct section could be problematic.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be proficient in interpreting the syntax and structure of ORG files and capable of handling various content types and formatting styles."
