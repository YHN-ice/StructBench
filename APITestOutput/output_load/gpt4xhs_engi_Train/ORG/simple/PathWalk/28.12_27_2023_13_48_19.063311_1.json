Inconsistent use of heading levels could make it difficult to identify the correct section and subsection.\n\n4. **Formatting Variations**: There might be variations in formatting within the ORG file, such as additional markup for links, TODO items, tags, properties, or special blocks that could complicate the parsing process.\n\n5. **Large Content Blocks**: If the subsection contains a large block of text or code, it may be challenging to provide an excerpt without losing context or relevant information.\n\n6. **Encoding and Special Characters**: The file may contain special characters or be encoded in a way that is not immediately readable, requiring decoding or special handling.\n\n7. **Embedded Content**: An ORG file can include links to external sources or embedded content like images or tables, making the retrieval of a plain text excerpt more complex.\n\n8. **Access to File**: Since I will need to read the content directly from the ORG file, I need access to this file. If there are any issues with accessing the file content, that would be a major obstacle.\n\nOnce I have access to the ORG file, I can proceed to parse it and extract the content of the requested subsection."
