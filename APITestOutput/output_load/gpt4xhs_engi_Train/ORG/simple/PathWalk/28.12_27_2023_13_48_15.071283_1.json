The parser must correctly identify the beginning and end of the requested section without including content from sub-sections or adjacent sections unless specifically requested.\n\n2. **Formatting Variations**: The ORG format supports various ways to format content, including lists, links, bold or italic text, and more. The parser must maintain the original formatting when providing an excerpt.\n\n3. **Metadata and Directives**: ORG files can include metadata (like TODO statuses, tags, properties) and directives (such as `#+TITLE:` or `#+BEGIN_SRC`). The parser must decide which parts of this metadata to include in the excerpt.\n\n4. **Size of Content**: If the 1st section is very large, it might be challenging to provide a complete excerpt due to size constraints in the response. The parser may need to summarize or provide only a part of the section.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Headings**: If headings are not clearly marked or if there are multiple headings at the same level, it could be unclear which one is considered the \"1st section.\"\n\n6. **File Access and Parsing Errors**: There might be issues with accessing the file or errors during parsing, such as corrupted data or unsupported characters.\n\n7. **Incorrect Section Count**: Sections in ORG files are typically marked with asterisks (*). The parser could miscount the sections if there are other asterisks used for different purposes (like bullet points) or if there is missing context for where sections begin and end.\n\n8. **Encoding and Character Sets**: The text encoding of the ORG file must be correctly handled to ensure that all characters are displayed properly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the ORG file parser must implement robust parsing logic capable of handling the hierarchical structure and various formatting options of ORG files. Additionally, it may need to provide functionality for large text handling and correctly interpret metadata and directives present in the file."
