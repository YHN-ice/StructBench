I must be able to handle these variations to correctly parse the content.\n\n5. **Inclusive Content**: When extracting the content, it is important to include the heading line of the subsection, its body, and any sub-subsections that may come under it, maintaining the structure and formatting as it appears in the ORG file.\n\n6. **Incomplete or Malformed Structures**: If the ORG file is malformed or incomplete (e.g., missing headings or inconsistent indentation), it might be challenging to accurately parse the desired content.\n\n7. **Encoding and Character Issues**: ORG files may contain special characters or use specific encoding that could affect text extraction if not handled properly.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in preparing an accurate parsing method to answer the question effectively once the input ORG file is provided."
