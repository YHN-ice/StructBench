Static parsing won't execute or render this content.\n\n7. **File Size**: If the ORG file is particularly large, performance could be an issue when parsing and extracting the requested information.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: Files can have different encodings (UTF-8, ISO 8859-1, etc.), and incorrect handling of the file encoding might lead to misrepresentation of text, especially for non-ASCII characters.\n\n9. **Comments and Inactive Timestamps**: Comments and inactive timestamps (`#+COMMENT:` or `[]`) should be identified and treated according to what is being asked (either include or exclude them).\n\nEnsuring that all these aspects are correctly handled is crucial for accurately extracting and presenting the requested content from the ORG file."
