Similar Headings: There might be similarly named or numbered headings which could cause confusion. It's important to distinguish and navigate through them correctly using their hierarchical position.\n\n3. Incomplete Information: The file might not be complete or might have cut-off sections which would make it impossible to locate or extract the desired content accurately.\n\n4. Ambiguous Numbering: If the numbering of sections is not straightforward or there's a discrepancy in the numbering sequence, it could complicate locating the correct content.\n\n5. Formatting Variations: ORG files can contain various formatting styles for headings, lists, etc., and inconsistency in these could make it difficult to parse the file accurately.\n\n6. Text Encoding: If text encoding isn't standard or there are special characters, it could lead to issues in reading the content accurately.\n\n7. Large Files: If the ORG file is very large, it could be challenging to process quickly, especially if not optimized for large file handling.\n\n8. Embedded Content: ORG files can contain links, images, code blocks, etc. These may need special consideration when extracting and presenting text content.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must have robust logic to interpret the hierarchical structure correctly, handle various formatting issues, and manage any special content.
