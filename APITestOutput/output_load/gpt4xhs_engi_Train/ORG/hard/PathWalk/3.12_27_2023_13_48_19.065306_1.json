Some ORG files may use stars (*) for different heading levels, while others may use different characters or indentation levels. Consistent parsing logic is needed to handle these variations.\n\n3. **Embedded Content**: ORG files can contain a variety of content types, including text, source code blocks, links, and more. The parser must be able to differentiate between these types of content and extract only the relevant text for the given question.\n\n4. **Multi-line Content**: The content under a heading may span multiple lines and could include blank lines or lines with additional formatting (like lists or tables). The parser must be able to collect all these lines until the next heading is reached.\n\n5. **Metadata and Tags**: Headings in ORG files can include metadata such as TODO states, priority, tags, etc. Depending on the question, the parser might need to ignore or include this metadata in the output.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a systematic approach would be needed to read and interpret the ORG file structure correctly, identify headings at various levels, and extract the relevant content without losing any contextual information."
