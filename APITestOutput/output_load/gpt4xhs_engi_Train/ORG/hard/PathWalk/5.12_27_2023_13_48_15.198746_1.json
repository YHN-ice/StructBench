Ensuring that the parser correctly identifies the hierarchy is crucial.\n\n2. **Handling Formatting and Syntax:** ORG files can contain a variety of formatting options like lists, links, bold, italic text, etc. The parser must handle these without error to provide the correct excerpt.\n\n3. **Preserving Original Structure:** The parser should provide the content as is, including any whitespace, lists, or other structural elements, to give an accurate representation of the content.\n\n4. **Accurately Navigating the File:** If the file is large or complex, the parser must accurately navigate to the required section and subsection without getting lost in the content.\n\n5. **Handling Embedded Code or Special Blocks:** ORG files can include source code blocks or special blocks (e.g., quote blocks). The parser must recognize these and include them in the output if they are part of the requested content.\n\n6. **Dealing with External References or Links:** If the subsection contains links or references to external content, the parser may need to decide whether to include just the link text or attempt to resolve and include linked content.\n\n7. **Error Handling:** The parser must be prepared to handle any errors or unexpected content in the ORG file gracefully.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file, I will be able to parse it according to these considerations and extract the requested content."
