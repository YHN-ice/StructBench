Mistaking the heading levels might lead to identifying the wrong section or subsection.\n\n3. **Variation in Formatting**: If the ORG file does not strictly follow a consistent formatting for headings and subheadings, it may be difficult to parse correctly.\n\n4. **Content Differentiation**: Differentiating between headings and content may be problematic if the file doesn't follow a clear pattern or if there is inline content that could be confused with a heading.\n\n5. **Large File Size**: If the ORG file is very large, it may take time to parse through all of its content to reach the desired location.\n\n6. **Encoding and Character Issues**: If the file uses special characters or has encoding issues, it might hinder text extraction.\n\n7. **Embedded Content**: ORG files can contain links, lists, tables, and code blocks.
