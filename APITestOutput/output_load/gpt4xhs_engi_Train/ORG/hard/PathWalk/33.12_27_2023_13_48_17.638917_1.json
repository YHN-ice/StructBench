Care must be taken to not confuse these with headings.\n\n5. **Embedded Code or Special Blocks**: Some ORG files include source code blocks or special blocks (like quote blocks), which might be formatted differently and could affect parsing.\n\n6. **Tables and Lists**: Tables and lists could be interspersed within the text, complicating the extraction of just the narrative content.\n\n7. **Metadata**: ORG files can include metadata (tags, TODO states, timestamps, etc.). It's important to decide whether to include or exclude this in the output.\n\n8. **Attachments and Images**: If there are attachments or images linked within the section, it might be unclear how to handle these in the text-based output.\n\n9. **File Encoding and Character Set**: The file encoding might affect how text is read and interpreted, especially for non-ASCII characters.\n\n10. **User Permissions**: Depending on the system, there might be permissions issues accessing the file.\n\nOnce I have access to the actual ORG file content, I'll be able to parse the document and extract the required information while addressing these potential challenges."
