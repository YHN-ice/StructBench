Identifying Bold Syntax: ORG files use specific markdown-like syntax to denote bold text, typically wrapping the text in asterisks (*).

Handling Nested Formatting: Bold text in ORG files might be nested within other formatting styles (like italics, underlining, etc.), which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. Multi-line Bold Text: Bold text might span multiple lines, and a parser needs to correctly handle this without cutting off at line breaks.\n\n4. Inconsistent Formatting: Users might not always perfectly adhere to the markdown rules for bold text, introducing inconsistencies like missing asterisks or additional spaces that could trip up a parser.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: Asterisks used for purposes other than bold formatting might be escaped, and these should not be interpreted as bold text markings.\n\n6. Overlapping Formats: Bold text might overlap with other elements such as lists, headers, or links, requiring the parser to consider context.\n\n7.
