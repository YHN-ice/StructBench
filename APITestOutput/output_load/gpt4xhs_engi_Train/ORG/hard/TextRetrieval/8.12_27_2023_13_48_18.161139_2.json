So, the parser must handle all these variations.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative or absolute. The parser should be able to recognize both and extract just the file names if that's what's required.\n\n3. **Linked vs. Embedded Images**: Images can either be linked from external sources or embedded directly into the ORG file. Embedded images might be base64 encoded or included in a different manner, which could be more complex to extract.\n\n4. **File Formats**: There are numerous image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, .svg, etc.), and the parser should recognize all of them.\n\n5. **Comments and Non-image Files**: The ORG file may contain comments or links to non-image files that should be properly ignored.\n\n6. **Inactive Links**: ORG mode allows links to be \"activated\" or \"deactivated.\" Deactivated links (those with a `:` immediately following the double brackets) might not be intended to display as images.\n\n7. **Markup Complexity**: ORG files can have complex structures with headlines, lists, tables, and blocks that might contain image links. The parser needs to sift through this structure without getting confused by other markup.\n\nOnce I have access to the ORG file content, I will scan it for patterns that match image file inclusions and extract the filenames accordingly while dealing with the listed potential issues."
