I need to be prepared to recognize all possible patterns.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: Images can be included with absolute, relative, or no path at all if they’re in the same directory. Parsing these correctly is crucial to identify the file names.\n\n3. **Multiple Image Formats**: ORG files might contain various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF). I must be able to handle all common image types.\n\n4. **Inline Images vs. Links**: Sometimes images are linked rather than directly embedded, which might require different parsing logic.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Links**: Images might be commented out or included as inactive links. Deciding whether to count these as \"included\" images would be a challenge.\n\n6. **Multi-line Links**: If an image link is broken across multiple lines for formatting reasons, it can complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. **Image Captions or Attributes**: Some images might have captions or additional attributes that need to be ignored when extracting just the file name.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the ORG file uses a non-standard encoding or contains special characters in image file names, this could present difficulties in accurately parsing and displaying the names.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I will apply appropriate parsing logic to extract all image file names while navigating these potential obstacles."
