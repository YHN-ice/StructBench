Being able to recognize all the possible variations is necessary to extract all images.\n\n2. **File Path Formats**: Images can be included using absolute or relative paths. Relative paths could be particularly challenging because they depend on the ORG file's location.\n\n3. **Hidden Links**: Sometimes, images might be included as part of a collapsed section or hidden behind a tag that is not immediately visible without processing the entire context.\n\n4. **Linked Files**: An image could be included within another file that is linked from the ORG file. This would require parsing linked files as well.\n\n5. **Markup Confusion**: ORG files can contain a lot of markup, and it's possible for text to coincidentally resemble image file syntax without actually being an image link.\n\n6. **External Resources**: Some images might be referenced from external sources (e.g., URLs), and distinguishing between external and local images may be necessary.\n\n7. **Non-standard Extensions**: Images can have a variety of file extensions (e.g., jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, etc.), and some may be non-standard or less common.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: The ORG file's encoding might affect how the text is read and interpreted, which could potentially hide or obscure image links.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges can help in preparing an effective strategy for parsing the ORG file and ensure no image files are missed during the extraction process. Now that we have identified potential issues, we can proceed to look at the input and parse it accordingly."
