Commonly, asterisks (*) are used, but the number of asterisks and whether spaces are included can vary. It's important to recognize all the variations.\n\n2. **Embedded Formatting**: Bold text might be embedded within other formatting, such as links or italics, which could complicate the extraction process. We need to ensure that these cases are handled correctly.\n\n3. **Multi-line Text**: Bold text may span across multiple lines. The parser must be able to detect and correctly extract such instances.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, characters used to denote formatting (like *) might be escaped within the text, indicating that they are not meant to format the text. The parser must distinguish between formatting symbols and escaped symbols.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting**: In some cases, the formatting might not be correctly closed (e.g., a missing asterisk at the end of bold text). The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n6. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other bold sections, which requires careful parsing to ensure proper extraction.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Special Sections**: Text within code blocks or special sections might not be intended for formatting even if it contains asterisks. These should be ignored in the extraction process.\n\n8. **File Size and Performance**: If the ORG file is large, performance could be an issue. Efficient parsing strategies will be needed to handle large files without significant slowdowns.\n\nTo give you an accurate answer, I would need to see the input ORG file to determine how the bold texts are formatted and to apply the necessary parsing logic accordingly."
