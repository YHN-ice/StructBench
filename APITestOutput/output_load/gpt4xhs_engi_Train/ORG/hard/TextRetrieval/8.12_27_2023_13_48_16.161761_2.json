Each type of link requires a different parsing approach.\n\n3. **Link Ambiguity**: Sometimes text might look like a link but isn't an actual link to an image file (e.g., example.com/image.jpg might be just text and not a link).\n\n4. **Embedded vs. External Links**: Images might be embedded directly into the ORG file in base64 format or linked externally. Extracting filenames from external links is straightforward, but identifying embedded images might require looking for specific encoding types.\n\n5. **File Extensions**: There could be a variety of image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser will need to recognize all possible image formats.\n\n6. **Hidden or Commented Links**: Sometimes, image links might be commented out or included in sections that are not rendered or exported when the ORG document is processed.\n\n7. **File Existence Verification**: If required, verifying the existence of the image files would be outside the scope of pure text parsing and would involve file system access.\n\n8. **Text Encoding**: The ORG file might use a text encoding that doesn't match the expected one (typically UTF-8), which could cause issues with reading the file correctly.\n\nTo properly address these issues, a robust parsing approach that accurately identifies image file paths within the constraints of the ORG file format is needed."
