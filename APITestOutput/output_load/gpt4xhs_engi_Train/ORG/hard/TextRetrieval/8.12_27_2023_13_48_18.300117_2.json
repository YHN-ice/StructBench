The parser needs to handle all these cases.\n\n3. **Different Image Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). The parser should recognize all common image formats.\n\n4. **Link Clutter**: Links to images can be surrounded by other text or markup that could make it difficult to parse out just the image file names.\n\n5. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images may be referenced by absolute or relative paths, and the parser must extract the filename regardless of the path's nature.\n\n6. **File Paths with Spaces**: File paths that include spaces or special characters may be enclosed in double quotes or angle brackets, which requires additional parsing logic.\n\n7. **Recursive Includes**: ORG files can include other ORG files, which might also contain image links. A comprehensive parser might need to follow these includes recursively to find all images.\n\n8. **Embedded Base64 Images**: In some cases, images might be embedded directly in the file as Base64 encoded strings rather than linked as separate files. These would not have traditional filenames but could still be considered included images.\n\n9. **Commented or Inactive Links**: Some image links might be commented out or marked as inactive. Depending on the requirements, the parser may need to ignore these.\n\n10. **Filtering Out Non-Image Files**: The parser must distinguish between links to image files and links to other types of files and only extract the image ones.\n\nUnderstanding the format and syntax rules of ORG files is crucial to overcome these challenges and extract image filenames accurately.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file content so I can parse it for included image files."
