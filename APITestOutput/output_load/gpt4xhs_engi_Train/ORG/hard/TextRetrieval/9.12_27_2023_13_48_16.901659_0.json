The parser must distinguish these from bold syntax.\n\n6. **File Structure**: ORG files can contain additional structural elements like headlines, lists, blocks, and tables. The parser needs to handle these structures appropriately and not confuse them with bold text.\n\n7. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which would require the parser to maintain state across line breaks.\n\nOnce we have the input file content, we will need to address these potential difficulties to correctly parse and extract all the bold texts."
