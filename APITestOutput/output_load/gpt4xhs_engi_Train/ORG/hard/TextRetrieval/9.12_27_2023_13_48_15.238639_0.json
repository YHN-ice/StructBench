Inline Formatting: Bold text can be inline with other text, which means we need to extract parts of a line that are bold without taking the entire line unless it's all bold.\n\n3. Nested Formatting: Sometimes, bold text might be nested within other formatting tags (like italic, underlined, etc.), which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. Escaping Characters: In some cases, the syntax characters for bold might be escaped to show them as literals rather than formatting, which means they should not be treated as bold.\n\n5. Multiline Bold Texts: If the ORG file supports multiline bold texts, we need to handle that by looking for the start and end tags across multiple lines.\n\n6. Variations in Syntax: Different ORG files might use slightly different syntax or have customizations that affect how bold is denoted.\n\n7. Incomplete Formatting: There might be instances where the bold syntax is started but not properly ended, leading to ambiguity about what is meant to be bold.\n\nTo handle these challenges, we would need a robust parsing strategy that can navigate through the text, correctly identify bold markers, and handle edge cases appropriately.
