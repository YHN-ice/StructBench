Identifying image links: Images in ORG files might be linked in different ways, with various syntaxes for embedding or linking.

Ensuring that we correctly identify and handle both types is important for accurately extracting file names.\n\n3. Inline images vs. attachments: Images could be included inline within the content or attached separately. The parser must distinguish between these types to extract them correctly.\n\n4.

Multi-line links: Sometimes, links to images could be broken up across multiple lines, which makes it challenging to detect and extract them as a single file name.\n\n6. Markup variations: ORG mode allows for customization and extensions, so there may be variations in markup that could affect how images are referenced.\n\n7.
