The parser needs to recognize all the possible image formats that might be included.\n\n2. **Image Links vs. Attachments**: Images can be included in an ORG file as direct attachments or as links to images hosted elsewhere. The parser must differentiate between these and extract only those that are actually contained within the file.\n\n3. **Syntax Variations**: The syntax for including images in ORG files could vary (e.g., using different markup tags or conventions). The parser needs to handle these variations accurately.\n\n4. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Sometimes images are embedded directly in the file as Base64 encoded strings. Extracting filenames for these might be not applicable.\n\n5. **Path and Filename Extraction**: Images could be included with relative or absolute paths, and these paths might need to be parsed correctly to extract just the filenames.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There may be text that looks like an image file but isn't (e.g., a link to a webpage that ends with .jpg but is not an actual image file).\n\n7. **File Organization**: Images might be organized in subdirectories within the ORG file, and the output should reflect just the filenames, not the entire path.\n\n8. **File Accessibility**: If images are referenced but not accessible (e.g., links to private resources), this could pose a problem for verification. However, for the purpose of just extracting the names, this may not be an issue.\n\nOnce we have the input ORG file, we can apply a parsing strategy that accounts for these potential issues to extract the image file names accurately."
