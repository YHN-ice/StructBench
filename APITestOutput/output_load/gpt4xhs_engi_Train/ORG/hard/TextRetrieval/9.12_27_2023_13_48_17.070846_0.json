I need to accurately identify this pattern while not confusing it with other ORG formatting or literal asterisks in the text.\n\n2. **Multiple Bold Sections**: A single line may contain multiple bold sections. The parser should handle this and extract all the bold phrases without merging or omitting any.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italic or underlined text. The parser needs to correctly extract bold text without including surrounding formatting.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks could be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which means they should not be parsed as bold text. Identifying and handling escapes is necessary to avoid false positives.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Wrapping**: Bold text may span across lines or be wrapped due to line breaks. The parser should be able to handle this and still extract the bold text correctly.\n\n6. **Consistency Across Versions**: ORG file syntax may have slight variations or updates between different versions of the software that uses them (like Emacs Org mode). Ensuring compatibility and consistent parsing across these could be a concern.\n\n7. **Invalid Formatting**: If the ORG file has incorrect formatting (e.g., missing closing asterisk), it might be difficult to determine where the bold text actually ends.\n\nOnce I receive the input ORG file, I will apply these considerations to accurately extract and print the bold texts."
