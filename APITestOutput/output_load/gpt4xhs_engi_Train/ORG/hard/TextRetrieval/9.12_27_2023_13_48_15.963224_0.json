However, customizations or updates to the format might introduce variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested within other formatting, like links or code blocks. This may require careful parsing to extract just the bold text without including surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Some asterisks in ORG files might be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), meaning they don't make the text bold but are literal asterisks. These need to be distinguished from those used for bold formatting.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold formatting might span multiple lines, which requires a multiline parsing mechanism.\n\n5. **Inconsistencies in Formatting**: There might be inconsistencies in the ORG file where the bold formatting is incorrectly applied (e.g., missing closing asterisk), which could lead to challenges in accurately extracting the text.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, these potential issues will be taken into account while parsing and extracting the bold texts."
