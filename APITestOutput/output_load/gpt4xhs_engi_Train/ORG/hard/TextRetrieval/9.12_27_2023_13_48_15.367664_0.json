Typically, bold text is surrounded by asterisks like `*bold*`. However, if there are multiple asterisks or mixed formatting, it might complicate parsing.\n\n2. **Asterisks Used for Other Purposes**: Asterisks are also used for creating lists or sections. Distinguishing between bold text and other structural elements that use asterisks will be crucial.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italic or underline. The parser needs to correctly handle such situations without losing the bold formatting.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape asterisks that are not meant to be interpreted as formatting (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`). These should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser needs to handle line breaks correctly within the bold formatting.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might make mistakes in their formatting (e.g., missing an asterisk at the end), which could lead to incorrect parsing of what is intended as bold text.\n\n7. **Unfinished Bold Syntax**: There could be instances where the bold syntax starts but does not end properly within the given text excerpt.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser needs a robust mechanism to correctly identify the start and end of bold text while ignoring false positives and handling edge cases appropriately. Regular expressions or a parsing library specifically designed for ORG mode could be helpful in this task."
