The parser must be able to handle such cases without extracting unwanted parts.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: Bold text may include special characters or symbols that could affect the parsing logic if not handled properly.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser needs to correctly identify and extract the entire section without cutting off at line breaks.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Asterisks**: Asterisks are also used for creating lists or sections in Org files. The parser must differentiate between asterisks used for formatting bold text and those used for structural purposes.\n\n6. **Inconsistencies in Formatting**: Users might inadvertently introduce inconsistencies in their formatting, such as mismatched asterisks or missing spaces, which can confuse the parser.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape markup characters to display them literally, which means the parser should not interpret escaped asterisks as indicating bold text.\n\nTo effectively extract bold text, the parser must be capable of handling these cases while adhering to the Org mode syntax rules.
