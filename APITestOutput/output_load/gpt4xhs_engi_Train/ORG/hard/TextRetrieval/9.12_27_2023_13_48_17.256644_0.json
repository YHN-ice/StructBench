However, if the formatting is inconsistent or if there are nested formatting markers, it could pose a challenge.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used for purposes other than denoting bold text might be escaped, and distinguishing between escaped and unescaped asterisks is necessary to avoid false positives.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting options, like italic, underline, or code blocks, and identifying only the bold text within such formats can be tricky.\n\n4. **Inline Code or Links**: Bold markers within inline code or links should not be interpreted as bold formatting. It’s important to recognize the context in which asterisks are used.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: If a bold section spans multiple lines or paragraphs, handling line breaks and joining lines correctly will be important to extract the full bold text.\n\n6. **Special Org Constructs**: Org mode supports special constructs like drawers or blocks that may contain asterisks for purposes other than formatting.
