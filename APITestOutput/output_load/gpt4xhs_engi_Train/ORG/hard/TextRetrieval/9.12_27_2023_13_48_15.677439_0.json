The common syntax is wrapping text with asterisks, like so: `*bold text*`. However, some implementations might allow other delimiters or require escape characters.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. This could complicate the extraction process, as we would need to ensure that only the bold formatting is considered.\n\n3. **Multi-line bold text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it can be tougher to extract using simple line-based parsing methods. We would have to account for this and ensure that the entire bold section is captured.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Org-mode uses the backslash (\\) as an escape character. Parsing needs to handle situations where asterisks are escaped and not intended to signify bold text (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`).\n\n5. **Distinguishing from headlines**: In ORG files, headlines are also denoted by asterisks, typically starting at the beginning of a line (e.g., `* Headline`). We would need to distinguish these from bold texts within content lines.\n\n6. **Comments and directives**: ORG files may contain comments and directives that could include asterisks. These should not be confused with bold text.\n\n7. **Embedded links and footnotes**: Bold text might contain links or footnotes, which have their own syntax that might interfere with simple asterisk matching.\n\nIt’s important to note that without seeing the actual input file and the specific syntax it uses, there could be additional unforeseen challenges. Once we observe the input file, we can decide on a strategy to accurately extract the bold texts."
