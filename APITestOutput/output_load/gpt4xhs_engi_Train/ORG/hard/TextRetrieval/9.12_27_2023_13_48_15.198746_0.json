Distinguishing between these uses and actual bold text is essential.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Malformed Markup**: Inconsistent markup, such as missing closing asterisks, could lead to incorrect extraction of text or failure to recognize bold text.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, escape characters are used to prevent markup from being parsed as such.
