You'll need to correctly identify the syntax that points to image files.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image files might be included using relative paths, which depend on the ORG file's location, or absolute paths, which point to a specific location on the file system. It's important to distinguish between these to accurately extract file names.\n\n3. **Various Image Formats**: Images can come in various formats like JPG, PNG, GIF, etc. The parser must recognize all possible image formats.\n\n4. **Inline Images**: ORG mode supports displaying images inline. These images are included with specific markup that might be different from regular links.\n\n5. **Linked vs. Embedded Images**: Images might not be physically present in the ORG file but could be linked from external sources (e.g., URLs). We need to differentiate between linked and embedded images.\n\n6. **Textual Noise**: The presence of non-image URLs or text that looks like image filenames but isn't (for example, code blocks or comments) could confuse the parser.\n\n7. **Formatting Variations**: The ORG file could contain formatting that affects how links are presented, such as footnotes, tables, or other org-mode constructs, which need special handling.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we should carefully parse the ORG file's content to accurately extract and list the image file names.
