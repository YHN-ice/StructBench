The parser has to extract the bold text without being thrown off by surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Special characters**: If the bold text contains special characters used for formatting (like `*` or `/`), the parser needs to handle these correctly and not misinterpret them as formatting markers.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, formatting characters are escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), and the parser should not treat these as bold.\n\n5. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text could span multiple lines, and the parser should be able to extract it in its entirety.\n\n6. **Mixed content**: A line can contain both bold and non-bold text, so the parser must selectively extract only the bold portions.\n\n7. **Contextual parsing**: The context around the bold text might affect its interpretation, like headings or list items.
