The parser needs to distinguish these and potentially normalize them to extract just the file names.\n\n3. **Variety of File Types**: There may be different image file types (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). The parser should be ready to recognize all the common image extensions.\n\n4. **Embedded vs. Linked Images**: Images might be directly embedded into the ORG file or linked from external sources. Only the filenames of embedded or locally linked images should be extracted, not URLs of external images.\n\n5. **Multiple Links on One Line**: There could be multiple image links on a single line, which the parser should split and capture individually.\n\n6. **Formatting Issues**: ORG files can be manually edited, so there may be inconsistencies in formatting or syntax errors that could throw off a simplistic parsing algorithm.\n\n7. **Markup Surrounding Image Links**: The parser might need to handle markup that could surround image links, like captions or formatting tags, without including them in the output.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Some characters in the paths might be escaped (e.g., spaces as `%20` or brackets as `%5B` and `%5D`), which the parser might need to unescape to obtain the correct file name.\n\nBy anticipating these challenges, we can create a more robust ORG file parser that successfully extracts all included image files' names."
