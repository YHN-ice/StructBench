Text is made bold by surrounding it with pairs of asterisks, like `*bold text*`. But you need to differentiate between actual bold text and asterisks used for other reasons, such as bullet points or italic text (which uses one asterisk).\n\n2. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for lists or headings, so it's important to discern the context to ensure that only bold texts are extracted and not asterisks from lists or headings.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links or code spans. The parser must be able to handle these nested formats correctly.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks that are meant to be displayed as characters rather than formatting must be handled correctly. This usually involves detecting a backslash `\\` before an asterisk.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, so the parser should be able to handle multiline formatting without breaking the output.\n\n6. **Special Org Mode Syntax**: Org mode has its own syntax for different functionalities (e.g., TODO items, tags, properties). It's important that the parser differentiates these from bold text.\n\n7. **File Inconsistencies**: If the ORG file was manually edited or generated by different tools, there could be inconsistencies in how the bold syntax was applied.\n\nHandling these challenges requires a careful approach, possibly with regular expressions tailored to capture only the bold text, or a proper parsing of the file structure to understand the context of each asterisk pair."
