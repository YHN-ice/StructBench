Different link formats: Images in ORG files can be included using different link formats or syntaxes. I need to be able to recognize all possible image link formats.\n\n2. Inline images vs. linked images: Images may be included inline with the text or as a separate link. Both cases should be handled properly to extract image file names.\n\n3. Variations in file paths: Image links may include absolute paths, relative paths, or URLs, and I should extract only the file names and not the entire paths.\n\n4. File name extraction: Once the image links are identified, extracting just the file names (without paths or URIs) requires precise string manipulation.\n\n5. Multiple images in one line: A line in the ORG file could include multiple image links, which requires parsing each link separately.\n\n6. Non-image files: Ensuring that only image files are extracted and not other linked files, such as documents or videos.\n\n7. Text that looks like links: There might be text that resembles a link but isn't one, so it's important to accurately identify actual links.\n\n8. Special characters: Handling file names with special characters or spaces correctly.\n\n9. File extensions: Recognizing all possible image file extensions such as .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, etc.\n\n10. Comments and directives: ORG files may contain comments or directives that might include text resembling image links; these should not be treated as actual images to extract.\n\nOnce you provide the ORG file content, I will be able to parse it according to these considerations and extract the included image file names."
