This could complicate the parsing as the bold text extraction needs to account for these possible nestings.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used for other purposes (e.g., lists or as literal asterisks) may be escaped, and distinguishing these from bold formatting is necessary.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: Bold texts may span across multiple lines, which means the parser should be able to handle line breaks within bold formatting.\n\n5. **Special Org-mode Constructs**: Org-mode in Emacs has many special constructs like headers, links, and directives that might include asterisks or other bold markers, and these should not be confused with actual bold text.\n\n6. **In-line Code or Blocks**: Bold markers within in-line code or code blocks should not be treated as bold text, as they are part of code literals.\n\n7. **File Readability**: Depending on the format of the input, if the ORG file is not provided in a readable format (e.g., as a string or as a file path), it would be difficult to process without additional steps.\n\nTo successfully extract all bold texts, the parser will need to correctly handle these challenges by analyzing the context in which the asterisks are used and apply appropriate parsing rules to extract only the intended bold text."
