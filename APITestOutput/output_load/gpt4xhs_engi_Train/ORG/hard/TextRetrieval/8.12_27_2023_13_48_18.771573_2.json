The parser must handle both scenarios properly.\n\n4. **Link Formatting Variations**: The links could be formatted in different ways within the ORG file, which could include variations in how links are presented (e.g., with or without brackets, using markdown style, etc.), and this could affect the parsing process.\n\n5. **Textual Noise**: An ORG file may contain text and other non-image related content which needs to be distinguished from the actual image links.\n\n6. **Data Integrity**: The text of the ORG file could include corrupted or broken links, making it difficult to determine if a link is an actual image file or not.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: Depending on the ORG file's encoding, non-ASCII characters in filenames may need special handling.\n\nNow that we've outlined some potential challenges, please provide the ORG file content so I can proceed with extracting the image filenames."
