The parser must be able to extract the links regardless of surrounding formatting.\n\n4. **Embedded vs. Linked Images**: Some images may be embedded directly into the file while others are linked. The parser should discern and extract only those that are linked.\n\n5. **Variety of image formats**: The parser should be prepared to recognize various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif).\n\n6. **Non-image files**: There may be other files linked within the ORG file; the parser should filter out non-image files.\n\n7. **Multiline links**: If an image link is broken across multiple lines, the parser must be able to concatenate and recognize it as a single link.\n\n8. **Escape characters**: The ORG file may contain escape characters that the parser will need to handle correctly to extract the file name.\n\n9. **Metadata and directives**: ORG files can have metadata or directives that might not be relevant to extracting images and should be ignored by the parser.\n\n10. **False positives**: Text that looks like a link but isn't a true file reference should be avoided (e.g., example text showing how to format a link).\n\nTo accurately extract image filenames, the parser must be robust enough to address these potential issues."
