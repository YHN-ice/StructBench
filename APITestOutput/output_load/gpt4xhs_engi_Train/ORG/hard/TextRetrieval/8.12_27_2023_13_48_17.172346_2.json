I will need to recognize the syntax used for embedding or linking images.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image files can be linked using either relative or absolute paths.

The parser needs to account for all possible image extensions.\n\n4. **Inline Images vs. Links**: ORG files can include images directly displayed within the text or as hyperlinks. I have to differentiate between actual image files and other types of links.\n\n5. **Markup Variations**: The markup surrounding image links might vary, including additional attributes or formatting that could complicate the extraction.\n\n6. **File Path Escaping**: Special characters in file paths might be escaped in different ways, requiring careful handling to extract the correct file names.\n\n7. **Textual Noise**: There might be non-image links or text that looks similar to image file paths but isn't actually an image link.\n\nThese challenges will require careful consideration when parsing the ORG file's content to accurately identify and extract all the included image filenames."
