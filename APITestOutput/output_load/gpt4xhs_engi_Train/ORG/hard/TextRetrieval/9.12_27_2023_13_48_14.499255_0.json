These need to be properly handled to avoid extracting non-bold content.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: If the markup for bold text is not correctly closed (e.g., missing an asterisk at the end), it could cause issues in identifying where the bold text ends.\n\n7. **File Encoding**: If the ORG file uses a specific character encoding that is not properly handled, it could lead to incorrect parsing of the file content.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the ORG file is very large, performance considerations may come into play, requiring efficient algorithms for parsing.\n\nCorrectly handling these issues requires a robust parsing strategy that can accurately identify and isolate the bold portions of text within an ORG file."
