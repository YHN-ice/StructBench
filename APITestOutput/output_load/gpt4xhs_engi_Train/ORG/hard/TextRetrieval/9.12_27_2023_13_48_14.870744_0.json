However, the number of asterisks and surrounding whitespace may vary (e.g., `*bold*` vs `* bold *`). We need to account for these variations when parsing.\n\n2. **Embedded Formatting:** Bold text might also include other formatting, such as links, code, or italic text, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Contextual Bold:** Asterisks can also denote headings or list items in ORG files. We must distinguish between heading/list markers and actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters:** If asterisks are escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), then they should not be treated as bold formatting.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts:** If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser needs to handle line breaks appropriately.\n\n6. **File Structure and Content:** An ORG file may contain structural elements like tables, blocks, or drawers that could include bold texts or affect how bold text is delimited.\n\nNow, please provide the ORG file input so that I can proceed to extract all bold texts for you."
