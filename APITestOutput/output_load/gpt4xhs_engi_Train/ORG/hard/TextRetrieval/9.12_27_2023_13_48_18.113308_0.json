Identifying Bold Syntax: ORG files typically use asterisks (*) to denote bold text, with the syntax being either a single asterisk (*) or multiple asterisks (**) surrounding the text. It's important to correctly identify this syntax to extract bolded content.\n\n2. Nested Formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links, italics, underlines, or code blocks. It is necessary to parse these correctly without losing the bold formatting.\n\n3. False Positives: Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, like creating lists or headlines. The parser must distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n4. Line Breaks and Multi-line Bold Text: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which requires handling line breaks and ensuring the entire bold section is captured.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: Sometimes asterisks might be escaped to show the literal '*' character without invoking bold formatting. The parser must handle escaped characters properly.\n\n6. Inconsistent Formatting: Users may not always follow strict formatting rules, leading to inconsistencies like unmatched asterisks which may cause difficulties in identifying the bold text.\n\n7. Incomplete Formatting: If the ORG file has incomplete bold syntax (e.g., missing closing asterisk), it might be challenging to decide how to handle these cases.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the parser needs to be robust enough to handle various scenarios and edge cases to extract bold text accurately.
