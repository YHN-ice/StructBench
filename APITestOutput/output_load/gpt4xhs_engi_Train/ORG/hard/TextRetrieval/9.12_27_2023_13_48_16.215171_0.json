Typically it is wrapped with asterisks like `*bold text*`. A parser must correctly identify this pattern.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other formatting, like italic, underlined, code or even links. The parser should be able to distinguish bold text in such cases.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks could be used in the text for other purposes than formatting, for example in lists or as bullet points. The parser must differentiate between formatting asterisks and non-formatting usage.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser should be able to handle this without breaking the bold text into separate parts.\n\n5. **Special Characters and Escape Sequences**: The presence of special characters or escape sequences within or around bold text could complicate parsing.\n\n6. **Document Structure Awareness**: Org files may contain structured elements like headers, lists, and blocks. Bold text might appear within these structures, and the parser should maintain the context if necessary.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help to create a robust parsing process. Now please provide the Org file input so I can proceed with extracting bold texts."
