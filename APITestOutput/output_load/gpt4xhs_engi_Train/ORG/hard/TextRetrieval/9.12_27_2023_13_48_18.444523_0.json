Common syntax for bold in ORG files may include surrounding the text with asterisks (e.g., `*bold*`) or using other markup methods. Recognizing and correctly handling all possible variations is necessary.\n\n2. **Embedded Formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting embedded within it, such as links, inline code, or italicized text. This could complicate extraction because you need to ensure that only the bold text is extracted, not the additional formatting.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other formatting structures like lists, tables, or headers. The parser must be able to navigate these structures and still extract the bold text accurately.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Characters used to denote bold formatting might be escaped in some parts of the text, meaning they should be treated as literals rather than formatting markers. The parser must differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n5. **Partial Formatting**: There could be instances where only part of a word or phrase is bolded. The parser will need to decide how to handle these cases—whether to extract the entire phrase or just the bold portion.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Sections On One Line**: A line might contain multiple sections of bold text separated by non-bold text. The parser needs to extract all bold sections without including the non-bold text in between.\n\n7. **Contextual Interpretation**: In some cases, understanding whether a piece of text is meant to be bold might depend on context that isn't immediately obvious from just the syntax, requiring a more sophisticated approach to parsing.\n\n8. **File Encoding and Format**: If the ORG file's encoding is not standard (UTF-8, ASCII, etc.), there might be issues with reading the file. Also, if the file isn't well-formed (e.g., has missing closing tags for bold), this might cause issues with parsing.\n\nAnticipating these challenges will help in creating a robust parser that can accurately extract bold text from an ORG file. Now you may proceed to show the input file for parsing."
