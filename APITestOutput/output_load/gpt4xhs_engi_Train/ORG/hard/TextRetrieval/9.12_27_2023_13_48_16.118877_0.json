Identifying bold syntax: The ORG file format uses specific markup to indicate bold text. Typically, asterisks (*) are used to mark the beginning and end of bold text (e.g., `*bold*`). We'll need to correctly identify this markup.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic or underlined text. We'll have to ensure that we correctly parse nested formatting without losing the bold markup.\n\n3. Inconsistent formatting: If the ORG file doesn't consistently use the correct markup for bold text, it may be challenging to identify all instances of bold text.\n\n4. Multi-line bold text: If bold text spans across multiple lines, it might be more difficult to extract, as we need to ensure that we capture the entire text block.\n\n5. Escaped characters: Characters that serve as markup signals can also be escaped to represent literal characters, which would mean they should not be interpreted as formatting. We'll need to differentiate between actual markup and escaped characters.\n\n6. Incomplete or broken formatting: If the markup for bold text is incorrectly applied or incomplete (e.g., missing an asterisk), it will be more difficult to accurately extract the bold text.\n\n7. Large files and performance: If the ORG file is very large, it could pose a performance issue, depending on how the parser is implemented.\n\nOnce we see the actual input file, some of these potential difficulties may become more relevant while others may not apply."
