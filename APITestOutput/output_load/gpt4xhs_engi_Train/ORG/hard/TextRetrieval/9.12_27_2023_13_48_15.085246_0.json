Parsing Syntax: ORG files use their own markup syntax to denote bold text, typically using asterisks or other markers. The parser must be able to recognize and accurately interpret this syntax.\n\n2. Inconsistent Formatting: Users might not always strictly follow the ORG formatting rules, leading to inconsistencies in how bold text is marked up.\n\n3. Nested Formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, such as italic or underlined text, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. Embedded Code or Links: Bold text might include links, code snippets, or other elements that could disrupt a simple text extraction process.\n\n5. Multi-line Text: If bold text spans multiple lines, the parser needs to handle line breaks appropriately.\n\n6. File Structure: An ORG file can contain various structural elements like headlines, lists, tables, etc. The parser must not confuse these with bold text markers.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser should:\n\n- Have a clear understanding of the ORG markup syntax for bold text.\n- Be robust against formatting inconsistencies and able to handle common variations.\n- Deal with nested formatting by implementing a stack or a state machine to keep track of the context.\n- Handle embedded elements by parsing them separately or ignoring them based on the requirement.\n- Maintain the integrity of multi-line text by correctly identifying the beginning and end of the bold text across lines.\n- Distinguish between structural elements and formatting to avoid false positives.\n\nOnce these are taken into account, I can efficiently extract all bold texts and present them separated by newlines as required. Please provide the ORG file content so that I can proceed with extracting the bold texts."
