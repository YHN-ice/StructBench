However, there might be variations in how this markup is used, or mistakes in the markup that could make automated detection difficult.\n\n2. **Embedded Markup**: Bold text might be embedded within other text elements or combined with other formatting (like italic or underline), which could complicate parsing.\n\n3. **Escaping Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks are used in the content but are not meant to denote bold text. These may be escaped or used in a different context, such as in lists or code blocks.\n\n4. **Incomplete or Broken Markup**: If the markup for bold is not properly closed (e.g., missing an asterisk at the end), it might be challenging to correctly identify the end of the bold text.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and handling multi-line formatting correctly can be challenging.\n\n6. **Nested Markup**: There might be nested markup within bold text, such as links, footnotes, or other styling, which would require careful parsing to extract only the bold portions.\n\nWithout seeing the input file, we can't create a precise algorithm, but we should be prepared to handle these potential issues when we start parsing the ORG file."
