The parser needs to correctly identify and extract the file names from both.\n\n3. **Embedded images versus linked images**: Images may be directly embedded within the ORG file in base64 or linked from external sources. Identifying which parts are actual file links is essential.\n\n4. **Inline versus block links**: Images could be included inline with text or as standalone block elements. The parser needs to distinguish these cases.\n\n5. **Text that resembles links**: Sometimes there may be text that resembles a link to an image but isn't one (e.g., example text, code snippets). The parser must avoid false positives.\n\n6. **Comments and inactive links**: Image links might be inside comments or marked as inactive. Depending on the requirements, these should typically be ignored.\n\n7. **Complexity in file naming**: Image file names may include spaces, special characters, or unicode characters, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. **File extensions**: Recognizing all possible image file extensions is necessary to ensure no image files are missed.\n\nNow, please provide the ORG file content so that I may attempt to extract the image file names for you."
