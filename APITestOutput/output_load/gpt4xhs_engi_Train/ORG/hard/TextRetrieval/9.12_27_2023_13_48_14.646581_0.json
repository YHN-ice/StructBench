Identifying bold syntax: ORG files use specific syntax to denote bold text, often using asterisks or other markers. I need to correctly identify and parse these markers.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting options like italic, underlined, or code blocks. This can complicate parsing as I must prioritize the bold syntax over other formatting.\n\n3. Inconsistent formatting: Users might not always use formatting consistently (e.g., mismatched asterisks), which can lead to incorrect parsing if the logic is not robust enough to handle irregularities.\n\n4. Multi-line bold text: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and I need to ensure that I capture the entire text that is intended to be bold without cutting it off at line breaks.\n\n5. Escape characters: Users might use escape characters to display what would otherwise be formatting markers as plain text, and these should not be parsed as formatting.\n\n6. Special Org-mode features: Org-mode has special features like drawers, blocks, and links that could potentially interfere with parsing if they contain what looks like bold formatting.\n\n7. Large files and performance: If the ORG file is large, the parsing process needs to be efficient to avoid long processing times or excessive use of system resources.\n\nOnce I have the input file, I will need to carefully handle these potential issues to accurately extract all bold texts."
