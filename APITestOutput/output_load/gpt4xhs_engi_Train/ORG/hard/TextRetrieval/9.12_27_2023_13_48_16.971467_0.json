However, if there are variations in formatting (like using different markers or syntax errors), it might be challenging to accurately identify all bold texts.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text could be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underlined, or code blocks. This adds complexity to parsing as the parser needs to recognize and correctly handle such nesting.\n\n3. **Asterisks in Non-Formatting Contexts:** Asterisks might be used in the file for purposes other than denoting bold text, such as in lists or for emphasizing a point without intending to format text as bold. Distinguishing these cases will require contextual understanding.\n\n4. **Incomplete or Broken Markers:** Sometimes, the markers indicating bold might be incomplete (e.g., missing one asterisk), leading to incorrect parsing.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Texts:** If bold formatting spans across multiple lines, it might introduce additional challenges in ensuring the entire bold section is captured.\n\n6. **File Corruption or Unusual Characters:** The file might contain corrupted data or unusual characters that aren't handled by standard parsing logic.\n\nThese are just a few challenges that might need to be navigated to successfully extract all the bold texts from an ORG file.
