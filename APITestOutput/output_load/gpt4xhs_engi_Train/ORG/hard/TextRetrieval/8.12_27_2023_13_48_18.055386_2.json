We need to understand this syntax to correctly identify image links or references.\n\n2. **Image Link Formats**: Images in ORG files might be included using different formats or patterns. For example, they could be linked using file paths or URLs, and they might be enclosed in various markup forms (like square brackets).\n\n3. **Variety of Image Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.). We need to account for all possible image extensions that could be present in the document.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be referenced using relative or absolute paths. In case of relative paths, understanding the base path is crucial.\n\n5. **Embedded Images**: In addition to linked images, ORG files may contain embedded images encoded in base64 or similar formats. These are harder to extract as filenames since they are not explicitly provided.\n\n6. **Markup Variations**: Different versions of Org-mode or user customizations could lead to variations in how images are included in the file (e.g., custom macros or shorthand notations).\n\n7. **File Access**: To parse the file, we need sufficient permissions and access to the file itself.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we would typically read through the content line by line, searching for patterns that indicate an image reference.
