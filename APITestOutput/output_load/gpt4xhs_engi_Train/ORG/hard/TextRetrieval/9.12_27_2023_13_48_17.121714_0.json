In ORG files, text is typically made bold by wrapping it with asterisks, like this: *bold text*. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be part of a larger formatted section, such as a headline or a list item. Ensuring that only the bold portion is extracted requires parsing the structure correctly.\n2. **Special Characters**: The ORG file may contain special characters or escape sequences that could interfere with straightforward text extraction.\n3. **Multiple Bold Sections**: A line may contain multiple bold sections interspersed with regular text. The parser must correctly identify and separate these sections.\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might have used inconsistent formatting which doesn't follow the typical *bold* syntax, making it harder to identify bold text without false positives or negatives.\n5. **Links or Code Blocks**: ORG files can include links or code blocks, which might contain asterisks that are not intended to denote bold text.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser will need to:\n\n- Recognize and adhere to the syntax rules for bold text in ORG files.\n- Ensure that the context of the bold text (like headlines or code blocks) is taken into account.\n- Handle special characters and escape sequences appropriately.\n- Deal with multiple instances of bold text within a single line or across multiple lines.\n- Distinguish between actual bold formatting and asterisks used in other contexts.\n\nIf you can provide the input file or an example of its content, I will be able to apply these considerations to extract the bold texts accurately."
