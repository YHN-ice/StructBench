It's necessary to differentiate between URLs and file paths.\n\n5. **Formatting Issues**: The ORG file could have formatting issues or typos that make it difficult to reliably identify image file names.\n\n6. **Embedded Code or Macros**: If the ORG file includes embedded code or macros that generate image file names dynamically, static parsing won't be sufficient.\n\n7. **Hidden or Encoded Images**: Sometimes images could be encoded or embedded in a way that's not straightforward to parse, like base64 encoded images within the text.\n\n8. **Comments or Inactive Blocks**: Image file names could be within commented sections or inactive code blocks, and it needs to be determined whether to include those in the output.\n\nGiven these potential issues, it’s crucial for the parser to be robust and flexible in handling various scenarios related to image file inclusion in ORG files.
