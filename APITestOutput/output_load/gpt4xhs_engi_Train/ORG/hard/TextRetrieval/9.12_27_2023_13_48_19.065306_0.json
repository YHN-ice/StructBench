Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise while trying to extract all bold texts from an ORG file:\n\n1. **Identifying Bold Syntax**: ORG files use specific syntax to denote bold text. Typically, it's done by surrounding text with asterisks, like this: `*bold text*`. Parsing requires accurately identifying the syntax amidst other content.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, such as italic, underline, or code blocks. This could complicate extraction as we need to ensure only the bold portions are selected.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: There may be special characters or escape sequences within or around the bold text that could affect the parsing process, making it a bit more complex to extract just the raw text.\n\n4. **Variants in Formatting**: Different versions of ORG mode or user configurations might allow for variations in how bold is denoted (for example, using different markers or settings).\n\n5. **Incomplete or Broken Formatting**: There could be instances where the bold formatting is not correctly closed off, which could lead to parsing the rest of the document as bold when it is not intended to be.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Sections in a Single Line**: Handling multiple bold sections on the same line might require a more complex parsing logic to separate and extract them appropriately.\n\n7. **Line Breaks within Bold Sections**: If a bold section spans across multiple lines, it's important to consider how to handle the newline characters within the extracted text.\n\nWith these potential issues in mind, I would be able to provide a more accurate and robust solution once I can see the input file and understand its specific structure and content."
