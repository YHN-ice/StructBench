The parser must handle all these variations.\n\n2. **File Format Identification**: The parser should correctly identify image files among other types of files. This requires recognizing various image file extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image files may be referenced through absolute or relative paths. The parser might need to distinguish between the two and handle them appropriately.\n\n4. **Duplicate References**: The same image might be referenced multiple times in the document. Depending on the requirements, the parser might need to filter out duplicates.\n\n5. **Link Text vs Link Destination**: In markdown-style links, there's typically a text portion and the actual link. The parser must be able to extract the link while discarding the link text.\n\n6. **Invalid Links**: There might be broken or syntactically incorrect links that should be ignored or flagged by the parser.\n\n7. **Embedded Images**: Images could be embedded directly into the ORG file in base64 format, rather than linked as separate files. These would need to be identified and potentially decoded.\n\n8. **Subtle References**: Images could also be included through indirect means, such as being part of a larger file or an archive, or included through scripting within the ORG file.\n\n9. **Performance Considerations**: If the ORG file is very large, the performance of the parser could be a concern and may require some optimization strategies.\n\nAddressing these issues requires careful design of the parsing logic and regular expressions (if used) to ensure that all valid image references are captured while false positives are minimized."
