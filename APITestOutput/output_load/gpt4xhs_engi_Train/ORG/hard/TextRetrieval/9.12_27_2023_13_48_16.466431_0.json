However, there are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process:\n\n1. **Inconsistent formatting**: ORG files may have different conventions for bolding text, depending on the user's customization. While the standard is a pair of asterisks (*bold*), there might be variations or errors in formatting.\n\n2. **Embedded asterisks**: There may be asterisks used within the text for other reasons (e.g., to denote a list item or a section heading). These need to be distinguished from those used for bold formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped asterisks**: Sometimes, an asterisk might be escaped to prevent it from being interpreted as a formatting marker. For example, \\*not bold\\*. These should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n4. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which would require the parser to recognize and handle line breaks within bolded sections correctly.\n\n5. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting elements, such as _italic_ or +underlined+ text. Parsing needs to handle these nested formats properly.\n\n6. **Partial bolding within words**: Sometimes, only part of a word might be bolded, like *bold*text or text*bold*. Ensuring that only the intended bold part is extracted can be a challenge.\n\n7. **Special characters**: Special characters or symbols adjacent to the asterisks might affect parsing if not handled correctly (for example, \"*bold*\").\n\n8. **File encoding and character sets**: Depending on the file's encoding, some characters may not be parsed correctly if the parser does not support that specific character set.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file, I can apply the necessary logic to overcome these obstacles and extract the bold texts correctly."
