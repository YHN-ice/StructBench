Typically, bold text in ORG files is delimited by asterisks, like this: *bold text*. Some potential difficulties and obstacles that could hinder the extraction process include:\n\n1. **Distinguishing Bold Text from Headings**: In ORG files, headings are also denoted with asterisks, but with spaces after them, like `* Heading 1`. We need to differentiate these from bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting within it, such as /italicized text/ or _underlined text_. Parsing such nested formatting correctly can be challenging.\n\n3. **Asterisks in Regular Text**: Asterisks may also be used for other purposes, such as bullet points or within code blocks, where they should not be interpreted as bold formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete or Incorrect Formatting**: There might be instances where the formatting is not correctly applied (e.g., missing one of the asterisks), which would make automatic detection of bold text difficult.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: Bold texts may span across multiple lines, which requires careful parsing to ensure that the entire bold section is extracted.\n\n6. **Special Characters**: Special characters within bold texts may require proper handling to ensure they are included in the extraction.\n\n7. **File Encoding and Format Compatibility**: The parser should correctly handle the file's encoding (e.g., UTF-8) and any format variations that may exist in different versions of ORG mode or user customizations.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, a parser must be designed to handle these nuances effectively. Now, if you provide me with the ORG file content, I will do my best to extract the bold texts for you."
