Understanding and correctly identifying this syntax is crucial to accurately extracting bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold texts might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underlined, code, or even within links. It's important to distinguish the bold text from the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: Bold text might contain special characters that are part of the ORG formatting or are escape characters. These need to be handled correctly to avoid misinterpretation.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it may require special handling as line breaks could complicate the parsing process.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Sometimes, users may not follow the correct syntax, leading to inconsistencies in formatting which can mislead the parser.\n\n6. **Encoding**: The file encoding might affect how the text is read and interpreted. Ensuring that the correct encoding is used to read the file is essential for accurate parsing.\n\n7. **Contextual Parsing**: The meaning of asterisks can change depending on the context (e.g., they can be used as bullet points or for other purposes in an ORG document), so it's important to parse them accurately within their context.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the ORG file is large, it can affect the performance of the parser. Efficient algorithms and approaches are necessary to handle large files without significant slowdowns.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser must have a clear set of rules and algorithms for identifying and extracting bold text that takes all of these potential issues into account."
