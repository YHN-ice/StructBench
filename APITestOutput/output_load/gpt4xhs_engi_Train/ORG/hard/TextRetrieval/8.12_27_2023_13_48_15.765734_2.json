The parser must recognize all these possibilities.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images might be included with relative or absolute paths, and the parser needs to handle both. Relative paths could also be based on a directory structure that isn't provided with the ORG file.\n\n4. **Embedded Images**: If images are embedded in base64 or another encoding directly within the file, they might not be represented as file paths. Extracting these would require decoding them.\n\n5. **External Links**: Images might be linked externally using URLs. Depending on the requirements, these might not be considered \"included\" image files for the purpose of extraction.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There could be lines of text that look like image file names but aren't actual links to images (e.g., example.png could be part of a text sentence rather than an image file reference).\n\n7. **Text Format Issues**: The ORG file could have formatting issues such as broken lines or incorrect syntax that could complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. **Large Files and Performance**: If the ORG file is very large, performance might become an issue, and the parser would need to handle this efficiently.\n\n9. **File Accessibility**: If the parser is expected to verify the existence of the image files, there might be an issue with file permissions or availability.\n\nNow that we've outlined potential difficulties, please provide the ORG file content for me to parse and extract the image filenames."
