We must understand and correctly interpret this syntax to extract bold texts.\n\n2. **Variations in Syntax**: Depending on the version of the ORG mode and user customization, the syntax for bold text could vary. We need to ensure that we can handle different syntax representations for bold texts.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatted text such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. We have to account for such cases and still correctly extract the bold portions.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: Bold text could span multiple lines, so the parser must be able to handle line breaks within bold text without terminating the extraction prematurely.\n\n5. **Escaping Characters**: Asterisks used for other purposes (e.g., bullet points) or escaped asterisks could be mistaken for bold formatting. We need to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters or other uses of asterisks.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: Sometimes users might forget to close the bold formatting with asterisks. Depending on how strict the parser is, this could result in either ignoring such instances or mistakenly including too much text as bold.\n\n7. **Performance**: If the ORG file is very large, parsing it efficiently without excessive memory usage or slow performance might be a concern.\n\nTo proceed, we need to see the input ORG file content to accurately identify and extract all bold texts."
