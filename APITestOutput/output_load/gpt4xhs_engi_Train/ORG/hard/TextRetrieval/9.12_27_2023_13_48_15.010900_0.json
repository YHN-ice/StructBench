The standard syntax is usually with text wrapped like so: `*bold*`. Identifying this pattern amidst other text while avoiding false positives (e.g. asterisks used for other purposes) can be challenging.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting options like italic, underlined, or struck-through text, which could complicate the extraction process if the parser does not correctly handle nested formatting.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks could also be used for bullet points or for emphasis in non-bold contexts. The parser must distinguish these cases from actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **File Structure and Content**: Depending on how the ORG file content is structured, there might be additional metadata or formatting instructions that need to be parsed correctly to extract just the bold text.\n\n5. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser will have to handle line breaks appropriately.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks may be escaped to show literal asterisks rather than formatting, and the parser should not interpret escaped asterisks as bold formatting.\n\n7. **Performance Concerns**: If the ORG file is very large, performance might be a concern, and efficient parsing strategies would be necessary to ensure timely responses.\n\n8. **Edge Cases**: Considering edge cases where the syntax for bold might not follow conventional patterns due to typos or non-standard usage within the file.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, the parser will need to be equipped to manage these potential obstacles effectively.
