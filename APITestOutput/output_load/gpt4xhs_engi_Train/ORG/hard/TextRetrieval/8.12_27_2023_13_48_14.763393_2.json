It's important to be aware of all the possible ways images can be embedded.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image references may use absolute or relative paths, and parsing these correctly is crucial to identify the image files.\n\n3. **Embedded Data vs. File Links**: Some images might be included as links to external files, while others could be embedded directly in the ORG file using data URIs. It's necessary to distinguish between these two types.\n\n4. **Multiple Images on a Line**: There could be lines with multiple images, and the parser needs to be able to handle this without missing any image references.\n\n5. **Comments or Inactive Markup**: Images might be included in comments or sections of the file that are not active parts of the document, leading to potential confusion over which images are actually used.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Different image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) should all be recognized by the parser, which means accounting for various possible file extensions.\n\n7. **Image References in Links**: Sometimes, images might be part of hyperlinks or other structures, which could make extraction a bit more complex.\n\n8. **Corrupted or Partial References**: Incomplete or malformed image references due to errors in the ORG file could lead to problems identifying and extracting the correct filenames.\n\n9. **File Encoding and Character Escaping**: Special characters in file names or paths might be escaped or encoded, and the parser should handle these correctly.\n\nEach of these points represents a potential challenge that needs to be addressed when creating an ORG file parser to extract image files."
