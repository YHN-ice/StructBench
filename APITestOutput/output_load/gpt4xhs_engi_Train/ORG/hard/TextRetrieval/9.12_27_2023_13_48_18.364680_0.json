Parsing out just the bold text while handling or excluding these nested elements could be a challenge.\n\n3. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it can be more challenging to extract, as the parser would need to recognize the continuation of the bold formatting across line breaks.\n\n4. **Ambiguity with Headings and Lists**: ORG mode uses asterisks for headings too (e.g., `* Heading 1`). It's important to differentiate between bold text and other elements that use asterisks.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: The ORG file might contain escaped asterisks that are not intended to denote bold text but are part of the content itself.\n\n6. **File Encoding**: The encoding of the ORG file could affect the reading process, especially if it contains non-standard characters that are part of the bold text.\n\n7. **Contextual Parsing**: Sometimes, the context in which the bold text appears may change the way it needs to be parsed, for example, if it's part of a special block or structure in the ORG file.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust ORG file parser would need to:\n\n- Adhere strictly to the ORG mode syntax for bold text.\n- Handle nested formatting within bold text appropriately.\n- Recognize multi-line formatted text.\n- Differentiate between bold text and other elements that use asterisks.\n- Handle escaped characters properly.\n- Support the correct file encoding.\n- Take into account the context within the ORG document where the bold text appears."
