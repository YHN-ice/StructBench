The parser needs to recognize the syntax used for including images, which typically involves links formatted in a specific way.\n\n2. **Variety of Link Formats**: Images within ORG files can be linked in various ways, including local file paths, URLs, or possibly inline data URIs. The parser must account for these different formats.\n\n3. **File Path Variations**: Local file paths can come in different forms, such as absolute paths or relative paths. The parser must correctly interpret these paths.\n\n4. **Link Identification**: Not all links in an ORG file are image links. The parser must differentiate between image file links and other types of links (such as hyperlinks to websites).\n\n5. **Different Image Formats**: Images can come in different formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.), so the parser needs to recognize all possible image file extensions.\n\n6. **Inline Images**: If images are included as base64 encoded strings or other inline representations, the parser has to extract and possibly decode them.\n\n7. **Link Markup Variability**: Users might include additional markup or descriptors within the link, which the parser must be able to handle without confusing it with the image file name.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Line**: There might be multiple images included on the same line or in the same block, which requires the parser to be able to handle multiple matches within a single line/block.\n\nAfter addressing these potential issues, we can proceed to extract image files included in the ORG file input you will provide."
