The parser must correctly identify this syntax, which is usually asterisks surrounding the text (e.g., `*bold text*`).\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. The parser must correctly handle these cases without confusing the different formatting directives.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks might also be used for other purposes in an ORG file, such as for bullet points or as multiplication operators in source blocks. The parser must differentiate between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Bold text could potentially span multiple lines or include leading/trailing whitespace that should be disregarded when extracting the text.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: The bold text may contain special characters or escape sequences that need to be handled appropriately.\n\n6. **File Size and Encoding**: Large ORG files or files with unusual encodings might present practical challenges in terms of parsing performance or correct interpretation of characters.\n\n7. **Incomplete or Malformed Markup**: If the ORG file contains errors in the markup (e.g., missing closing asterisks), this might complicate the extraction process.\n\nUnderstanding these potential challenges can help in developing a robust parser to accurately extract bold texts from an ORG file. To provide the correct answer, the parser needs to process the file and return only those texts that are correctly marked up as bold."
