Inline images are part of the content, while linked images might not be displayed and only serve as hyperlinks.\n\n4. **Path Complexity**: Some image files may have simple names, but others could have complex paths with directories and subdirectories, potentially including spaces and special characters that need handling.\n\n5. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There could be multiple images included on a single line, which means the parser needs to be able to handle and differentiate between multiple links.\n\n6. **Commented or Inactive Links**: An ORG file can contain commented-out lines or sections. Depending on the requirement, it might be necessary to ignore image links within those commented sections.\n\n7. **False Positives**: There could be text that looks like image links but isn't meant to be an image link. An example could be a code block or example block containing a sample link.\n\n8. **Image References Outside the File**: Some images might not be included directly but referenced through URLs or relative paths that point outside of the file.\n\nGiven these potential issues, we'll need to carefully parse the input while considering the structure and conventions of the ORG file format.
