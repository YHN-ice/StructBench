A parser must correctly identify the syntax pattern for bold text (`*bold text*`).\n\n2. **Dealing with nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting structures like lists, quotes, or other bold/italicized text. The parser must correctly handle such nested formatting without getting confused by other markup.\n\n3. **Incorrect formatting**: Users might create ORG files with incorrect formatting that does not comply with ORG mode standards. For instance, missing closing asterisks or additional spaces within the markup could complicate correct extraction.\n\n4. **Handling escape characters**: Sometimes asterisks are used in the text not to denote bold but as part of the content itself. The parser must differentiate between actual bold formatting and asterisks used as literal characters.\n\n5. **Multi-line bold text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, the parser needs to recognize and handle this scenario.\n\n6. **Other edge cases**: There may be other special cases like links, code snippets, or special blocks that include asterisks which should not be interpreted as bold text.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will attempt to address these challenges and extract all the bold texts accordingly.
