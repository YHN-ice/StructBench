The parser must handle both cases.\n\n4. **Different syntax for images**: There might be multiple ways to include images in an ORG file (e.g., using brackets or other markup), and the parser needs to recognize all of them.\n\n5. **Embedded Base64 images**: Sometimes images can be encoded in Base64 directly within the file. Detecting and possibly decoding these can be challenging.\n\n6. **Text that looks like image links**: Sometimes text within an ORG file might accidentally match patterns that look like image links but aren't (false positives).\n\n7. **Multiline links**: If links are broken across lines, identifying them might be more complex.\n\n8. **Escape characters**: The presence of escape characters in the paths or URLs might require additional processing to get the correct file names.\n\nOnce we receive the input ORG file content, we'll need to consider these potential issues while extracting the image file names."
