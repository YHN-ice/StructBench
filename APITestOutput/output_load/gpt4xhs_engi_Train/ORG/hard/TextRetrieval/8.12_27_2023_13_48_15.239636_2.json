Recognizing all the possible ways images can be included would be necessary.\n\n2. File path complexities: Images might have absolute or relative paths, and they might be located in different directories or subdirectories. Parsing these paths correctly to extract just the file names could be tricky.\n\n3. Image formats: There are various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser must be able to recognize all the relevant formats that could be present in the ORG file.\n\n4. Inline vs. block images: Images could be part of a text line (inline) or on their own line (block). The parser needs to handle both cases appropriately.\n\n5. Commented or disabled image links: Sometimes, images are included but commented out or otherwise disabled (e.g., using a special marker or syntax). Deciding whether to include these in the output could be an issue.\n\n6. Org mode-specific constructs: ORG mode has certain constructs like #+ATTR_ORG: lines preceding image links that specify attributes for the image. These need to be recognized and handled so as not to confuse them with actual image links.\n\n7.
