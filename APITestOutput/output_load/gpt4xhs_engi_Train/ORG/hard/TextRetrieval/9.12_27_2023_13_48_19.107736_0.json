This could make it difficult to cleanly extract just the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Asterisks**: Asterisks used for other purposes (and not for formatting) might be escaped with a backslash (`\\*`), which should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n4. **Inline Formatting Conflicts**: Bold text might be found inline with other text, with no clear delimiters to signal the start and end of the bold formatting.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If bold text spans multiple lines, handling line breaks could complicate the extraction.\n\n6. **Other Markup**: An ORG file may contain other markup elements such as headers, lists, or blocks that could be confused with bold text if not properly parsed.\n\n7. **Comments and Directives**: The file might contain comments or directives that use asterisks but are not meant to indicate bold text.\n\n8. **File Structure**: The structure of the ORG file must be understood and traversed correctly to identify the bold text accurately.\n\nThese are some of the potential challenges that one might encounter when trying to extract bold texts from an ORG file.
