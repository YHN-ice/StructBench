It's important to know all the syntax variations that could be used to include images, such as links or specific directives.\n\n2. **Variety of Formats**: Images can come in various formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.), so the parser must recognize all possible image file extensions.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images may be included using relative or absolute paths. The parser needs to handle both types of file paths correctly.\n\n4. **Multiple References**: An image file might be referenced multiple times in the document, so the parser should account for duplicates if the goal is to list unique image filenames.\n\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images can sometimes be embedded directly in the file in Base64 encoding rather than linked by filename. These wouldn't have traditional \"file names\" and might require special handling.\n\n6. **Links with Descriptions**: Some images might be included with a descriptive link text as well as the actual URL or path to the image. The parser must be able to extract the URL/path rather than the description.\n\n7. **Comments**: Image references could be included in commented-out sections of the ORG file, potentially leading to false positives if the parser doesn't differentiate between active content and comments.\n\n8. **File Structure**: ORG files have a specific structure that might include headings, lists, and other elements that could complicate straightforward text searches for image file names.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser must be tailored to understand the ORG file format and its possible variations in embedding images, as well as programmed to handle different edge cases as described above."
