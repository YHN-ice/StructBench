It's essential to understand the syntax that denotes bold text (typically, text wrapped with asterisks like `*bold*`).\n\n2. **Consistent Formatting**: If the file does not have consistent formatting, it might be difficult to correctly identify all instances of bold text. Users might use asterisks for other purposes or may not follow the syntax rules strictly.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, the asterisks might be escaped (for example, `\\*not bold\\*`), indicating that these asterisks should not be treated as formatting markers. Identifying escape characters and handling them correctly is essential.\n\n4. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, such as links, code blocks, or italicized text. Parsing nested formatting correctly can be complex.\n\n5. **Ambiguity in Syntax**: There might be ambiguous uses of asterisks that could be confused for bold formatting when they serve a different purpose (e.g., bullet points or separators between sections).\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it needs to be detected across line breaks. This could add complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n7. **File Size and Memory Management**: For very large ORG files, managing memory efficiently during parsing may become a concern.\n\n8. **Encoding and Character Sets**: The file's character encoding must be correctly handled to ensure that all characters are read and interpreted correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parser would need to have clear rules for identifying the start and end of bold text segments and be capable of handling exceptions and edge cases as described above."
