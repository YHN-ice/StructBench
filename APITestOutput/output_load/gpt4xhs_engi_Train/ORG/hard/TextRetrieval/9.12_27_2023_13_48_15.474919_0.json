We need to know the exact markup used for bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. We must ensure that only bold text is extracted and that nested formatting is correctly handled.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Bold markers could be escaped within the text (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which means they shouldn't be treated as formatting. We need to correctly ignore escaped formatting markers.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts:** If bold texts span multiple lines, we need to ensure that the entire bold passage is extracted, including any newline characters within it.\n\n5. **Linked or Tagged Text:** In ORG files, bold text may also contain links or tags that could complicate extraction. We would need to account for these additional elements and extract only the raw text.\n\n6. **File Structure and Metadata:** ORG files often contain structural elements like headlines, lists, and metadata. We need to distinguish between these elements and actual bold text content.\n\n7. **Incomplete Formatting:** If a file contains incomplete formatting (e.g., an opening asterisk without a matching closing asterisk), it could lead to incorrect or incomplete extractions.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can identify the specific obstacles it presents and address them accordingly in order to extract the bold texts accurately."
