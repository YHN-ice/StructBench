For example, a line could contain both bold and non-bold text.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, such as italicized text, code blocks, or links. This would require implementing a parser that can handle nested structures.\n\n4. **Multiline bold text**: If the ORG file allows for bold text to span across multiple lines, this would increase the complexity of the parser as it would need to keep track of the formatting state across line breaks.\n\n5. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes characters used to denote formatting (like `*`) might be escaped to display literally. The parser needs to distinguish between an actual formatting marker and an escaped character.\n\n6. **Inconsistent formatting**: If the user does not consistently apply the bold formatting (e.g., forgetting to close a bold section), this can lead to incorrect parsing where too much or too little text is extracted as bold.\n\n7. **Metadata and directives**: ORG files may contain metadata or directives that are not part of the actual content. The parser needs to differentiate between content and non-content sections of the file.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the ORG file is very large, performance could be a concern and would necessitate a more efficient parsing approach.\n\nTo extract all bold texts correctly, the parser must be designed to handle these potential challenges appropriately."
