The parser must differentiate between actual embedded image file names and mere URLs or links to images.\n\n5. **Encoded or Obfuscated File Names**: If the image file names are encoded or obfuscated in some way within the ORG file, additional steps would be required to decode or deobfuscate them before extraction.\n\n6. **Hidden or Commented Images**: Images embedded within comments or hidden sections won't be visible when rendered but could still be present in the raw ORG file content. Deciding whether to include these could be a challenge.\n\n7. **Handling Errors and Exceptions**: The ORG file might contain errors or invalid image syntax which the parser will need to handle gracefully without crashing or providing incorrect information.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the ORG file is very large with many images, there could be performance implications for the parser, which may need optimization to handle large files efficiently.\n\nOnce you provide the ORG file content, I will attempt to navigate these potential issues to extract the image file names."
