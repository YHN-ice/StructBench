The parser must be able to identify and process these variations correctly.\n\n2. **Variety of image extensions**: There are several image file formats, like jpg, png, gif, etc. The parser should be prepared to recognize all common image file extensions.\n\n3. **Relative vs absolute paths**: The image links could be relative to the ORG file's location or absolute paths that specify the full location of the image file. The parser should account for both types of paths.\n\n4. **Embedded vs linked images**: Some ORG files might have images that are embedded directly in the text (base64 encoded), while others might simply link to external files. The parser will need to distinguish between these cases.\n\n5. **Markup variations**: ORG mode markup may vary, with different ways to include images (like using #+CAPTION:, #+NAME:, embedding in a paragraph, etc.). The parser should be able to handle these differences.\n\n6. **Comments and non-image links**: The ORG file may contain comments or links to non-image files which should be ignored by the parser.\n\n7. **Multiline links**: Sometimes, if an ORG file is manually edited or generated by certain tools, links can be broken across lines. The parser might need to concatenate these lines to properly extract the image file names.\n\n8. **Escape characters**: Paths may include escape characters that the parser will need to interpret correctly.\n\nWe can address these challenges as we encounter them in the input ORG file provided.
