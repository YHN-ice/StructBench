Variations in Markup: Bold text in ORG files can be marked up in different ways, such as with asterisks (*bold*) or with specific markup commands. It is important to handle all such variations.\n\n2. Nested Formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italic or underlined text, or within links or code blocks, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. Incomplete or Broken Markup: Sometimes, markup might be incorrectly applied or left incomplete, making it difficult to identify the start and end of bold text reliably.\n\n4. Multi-line Bold Text: Bold text may span multiple lines, and extracting it would require understanding the context over line breaks.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: Special characters might be escaped within the text, which means an additional step to unescape them to get the raw text.\n\n6. Overlapping or Adjacent Bold Sections: There can be cases where bold sections are adjacent to each other or overlap with other formatting, which requires careful handling to avoid missing or duplicating text.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will help in devising a method that can accurately parse and extract bold text from the provided ORG file content."
