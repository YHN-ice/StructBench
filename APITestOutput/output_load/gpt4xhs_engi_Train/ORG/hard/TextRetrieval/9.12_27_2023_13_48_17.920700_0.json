Care must be taken to not capture non-bold text that is adjacent to the bold text.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, an ORG file parser would need to:\n\n- Strictly follow the ORG mode syntax rules.\n- Handle embedded and multiline formatting gracefully.\n- Exclude content that looks like formatting but is actually escaped or in a different context.\n- Clearly distinguish between bold and non-bold text, even when they're mixed on the same line.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file, I'll be able to handle these challenges accordingly and extract the bold texts."
