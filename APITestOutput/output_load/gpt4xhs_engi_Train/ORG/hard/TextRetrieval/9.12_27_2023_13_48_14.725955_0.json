This can complicate the parsing process.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Asterisks used for other purposes in the document might be escaped (e.g., \\*not bold\\*), which means they should not be interpreted as bold formatting.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and we need to decide whether to keep it as a multi-line block or concatenate it into a single line.\n\n6. **Consistency in Formatting**: The ORG file may have inconsistencies in how bold formatting is applied, which could lead to missed instances of bold text if the parser is not flexible enough.\n\n7. **Embedded Code or Special Blocks**: There might be code blocks or special syntax blocks where the asterisks are not meant to signify bold text but are part of the code or syntax.\n\nTo get accurate results, the parser needs to accurately recognize and handle each of these cases. Once we have the input file, we can apply a suitable parsing strategy to extract all the bold text, keeping these potential difficulties in mind."
