However, the number of asterisks and their placement can affect whether the text is interpreted as bold or not. For example, a single asterisk at the beginning of a line might be interpreted as a headline rather than bold text.\n\n2. **Inline vs. Standalone Bold Text**: Bold text can appear inline within a line or as a standalone line. Ensuring that the parser correctly identifies and extracts bold text in both contexts is necessary.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italics or underlined text. The parser must be capable of handling such cases without losing the bold formatting.\n\n4. **Special Characters and Escape Sequences**: Special characters or escape sequences might appear within or around the bold text, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting Across the Document**: There could be inconsistencies in how bold text is formatted throughout the document, making it difficult to apply a single rule to extract all bold texts.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to correctly identify and extract such instances.\n\n7. **Code Blocks or Examples**: Bold syntax within code blocks or example sections should not be interpreted as actual bold text since they are part of a verbatim section.\n\nTo address these potential difficulties, we need to carefully inspect the input file and determine the exact rules used to format bold text within that specific ORG file. Once we understand the formatting conventions used, we can accurately extract the bold texts."
