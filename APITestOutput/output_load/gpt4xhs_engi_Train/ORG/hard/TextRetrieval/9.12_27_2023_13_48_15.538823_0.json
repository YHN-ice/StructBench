The challenges we might face include:\n\n1. Distinguishing between bold text and headings: ORG files use one or more asterisks for headings, depending on the level of the heading (e.g., `*` for level 1, `**` for level 2). We need to distinguish these from bold text, which is enclosed in pairs of asterisks like `*bold*`.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, such as links, code blocks, or italicized text. We need to ensure that we capture the bold text without including the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. Multi-line bold text: If the bold text spans multiple lines, we need to handle line breaks correctly to extract the complete text.\n\n4. Escaped characters: Asterisks used as normal characters instead of formatting might be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`). We'll need to handle these cases and not mistake them for bold text.\n\n5. Partial asterisk matches: We have to make sure we don't accidentally extract text that isn't meant to be bold but happens to be surrounded by asterisks for other reasons.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would likely use regular expressions with proper conditions to extract only the bold text, being careful to account for the potential complexity of the formatting in ORG files."
