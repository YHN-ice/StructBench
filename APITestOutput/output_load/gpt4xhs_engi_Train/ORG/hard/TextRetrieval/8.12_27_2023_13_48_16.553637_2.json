Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered during this process:\n\n1. Identifying Image Links: Org files can include images in a few different ways, such as inline links, attachment links, or through embedded HTML. The parser needs to correctly identify all these possible formats.\n\n2. Variability in Link Formats: Image links may vary in syntax. For instance, some may use the 'file' keyword, while others may not. The parser must be able to recognize all valid representations of image links.\n\n3. Relative vs Absolute Paths: Image paths can be relative to the Org file's location or absolute paths on the filesystem. The parser should extract the filename regardless of the path's nature.\n\n4. Multiple Images on a Single Line: There might be lines with multiple image links, and the parser needs to extract each image file name separately.\n\n5. Non-Standard File Extensions: While common image extensions include `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., there could also be less common or custom file extensions that still represent image files.\n\n6. Hidden Characters or Formatting: The Org file might contain hidden characters or formatting that could disrupt straightforward text parsing, such as line breaks or special characters within links.\n\n7. Encrypted or Obfuscated Links: In some cases, links to images might be encrypted or obfuscated, making it difficult for a simple text parser to recognize them as image links.\n\nTo provide accurate answers, the parser must be able to address these difficulties by implementing robust text processing and pattern matching techniques."
