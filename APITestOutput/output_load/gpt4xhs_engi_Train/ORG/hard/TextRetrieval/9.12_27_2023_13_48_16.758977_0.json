Bold text is usually surrounded by pairs of asterisks like this: *bold text*. However, it's important to distinguish between bold formatting and other uses of asterisks, such as headings or list items.\n\n2. **Variations in Formatting**: Users might use variations in bold formatting, such as multiple asterisks (e.g., **bold**) or mixed with other formatting (e.g., */bold italic*). It's important for the parser to correctly identify these variations.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: There might be escaped asterisks in the text that should not be interpreted as bold formatting. The parser needs to recognize escaped characters and treat them appropriately.\n\n4. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting or contain other formatted text inside it (e.g., *bold with /italic/ inside*). The parser must be capable of handling such nesting without getting confused.\n\n5. **Inline vs. Block**: The bold text could appear inline with other text or as a block on its own. The parser should handle both scenarios correctly.\n\n6. **Contextual Misinterpretation**: Sometimes asterisks are used in contexts that do not relate to formatting, such as in mathematical expressions or within code blocks. These should not be misinterpreted as bold text.\n\n7. **Incomplete Formatting**: There could be instances where the bold formatting is not properly closed with a matching pair of asterisks, which could lead to difficulty in determining the end of the bold segment.\n\n8. **Line Breaks**: Bold text that spans multiple lines might present a challenge, as the parser needs to maintain the integrity of the bolded content across those line breaks.\n\nBefore parsing the actual ORG file, it is important to have clarity on these potential issues and decide on strategies to handle them effectively."
