The parser must recognize all the possible image formats.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: Images can be included with absolute or relative paths, and the parser must handle both. Additionally, file paths may vary across operating systems.\n\n3. **Link Syntax Variations**: ORG mode allows for different ways to include or link to files, such as using `[[file:path/to/image.jpg]]` or `[[./path/to/image.jpg]]`. The parser must be able to recognize all valid link syntaxes.\n\n4. **Image References Inside Other Elements**: Images might be referenced within other markup elements, like lists, tables, or nested within other links.\n\n5. **Non-Image Files**: There could be non-image file links mixed in that need to be filtered out so that only image filenames are extracted.\n\n6. **File Name Conflicts**: There might be images with the same filename but located in different directories. The parser needs to distinguish between them if the full path is necessary for clarity.\n\n7. **Multi-line Links**: Sometimes a link might be broken up over multiple lines, especially if the ORG file adheres to a strict line length limit.\n\n8. **Escape Characters**: Filenames or paths may contain escape characters that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n9. **Comments and Inactive Links**: The ORG file might contain commented-out links or inactive links that shouldn't be counted as included images.\n\n10. **Complex Markup Structures**: If the ORG file contains complex markup structures like macros or src blocks that generate images, these might be more difficult to parse correctly.\n\nEach of these potential issues would need to be addressed by the parser logic to ensure all and only image files are correctly extracted and listed."
