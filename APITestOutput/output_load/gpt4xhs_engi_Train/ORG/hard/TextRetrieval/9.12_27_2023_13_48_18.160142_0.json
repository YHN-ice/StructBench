The most common is surrounding the text with asterisks, like *bold*. There might be variations in the number of asterisks or other characters used for emphasis, which could affect the parsing.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as a section that is both bold and italicized. Parsing would need to account for this without mistakenly capturing adjacent formatting.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: The bold text might include special characters that could be interpreted as formatting markers by the parser. Care must be taken to distinguish between actual formatting markers and literal characters that should appear in the output.\n\n4. **Inline vs Block Text**: Bold text can appear inline (within a sentence) or as block elements (standalone paragraphs). The parser must correctly identify and extract both types.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Users might use escape characters to include what would otherwise be formatting markers in the actual text. The parser needs to recognize and handle these correctly.\n\n6. **Spans across Lines**: Bold text could span multiple lines, and the parser must capture the entire section without breaking at line ends if the format allows for it.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users may not consistently use formatting, for example, missing an asterisk at one end of the bold text. The parser must either correct for these errors or identify them as such.\n\n8. **Contextual Understanding**: Some bold texts might have specific meanings depending on their context within the document (e.g., headers vs emphasized words). The parser doesn't inherently understand context but may need to consider it for accurate extraction.\n\nOnce you provide me with the ORG file content, I can attempt to parse it and extract the bold texts, keeping in mind these potential difficulties and obstacles."
