You need to distinguish between these to extract only the file names.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links might use relative or absolute paths. While absolute paths can be extracted directly, relative paths might require additional context to resolve to an actual file name.\n\n4. **Formatting and Markup**: Since ORG files are plain text with markup, formatting elements like asterisks, brackets, or parentheses might be part of the image link syntax, and you need to parse these correctly to avoid including them in the file name.\n\n5. **Hidden or Commented-Out Images**: The ORG file could contain images that are commented out or otherwise not meant to be visible. Depending on the question's requirements, you may need to ignore these.\n\n6. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There could be lines with multiple images, which means you must parse each line carefully to ensure no image file names are missed.\n\n7. **Image File Extensions**: You'll need to recognize various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) to accurately identify image files.\n\n8. **Non-Standard File Names**: Some images might have non-standard or unexpected file names that don't follow common naming conventions, making it harder to identify them as images.\n\nOnce the input ORG file is provided, I will attempt to parse it and extract the image file names while addressing these potential issues as needed."
