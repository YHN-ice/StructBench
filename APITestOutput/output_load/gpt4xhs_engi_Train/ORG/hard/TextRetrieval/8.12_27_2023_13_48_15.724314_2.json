For instance, images could be linked using a variety of protocols (`http://`, `https://`, `file://`) or could be directly embedded in the document.\n\n2. **Variety of Image Extensions**: There are numerous image file formats such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. The parser needs to recognize all possible image formats.\n\n3. **Image References Inside Other Markup**: Images could be referenced inside links, within descriptive lists, or even embedded in code blocks. The parser must be able to distinguish actual images from such references.\n\n4. **Relative versus Absolute Paths**: The parser should be prepared to handle both relative and absolute paths to image files.\n\n5. **Image References as part of a Larger Syntax Structure**: In an ORG file, images might not always be on their own line or by themselves. They could be part of a larger syntax structure like org-mode links `[[file:image.png]]`, making extraction more complex.\n\n6. **Comments or Disabled Links**: Some image links may be commented out or disabled in the ORG document, so the parser needs to decide whether to include or exclude these.\n\n7. **Large Files and Performance**: If the ORG file is very large, the parser's performance could become an issue, especially if the parsing is done with less efficient string processing techniques.\n\nBefore starting the parsing, it would be essential to understand the exact syntax used for embedding or linking images in ORG files and then apply the correct regular expressions or parsing logic to extract just the image file names without any surrounding markup or text."
