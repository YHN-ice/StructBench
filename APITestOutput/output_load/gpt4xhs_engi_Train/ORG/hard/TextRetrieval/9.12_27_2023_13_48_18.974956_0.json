The parser must recognize this pattern amidst other content.\n   \n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be within other formatted text (e.g., links, italic, underline). The parser needs to detect bold text even when it's nested within or adjacent to other markdown elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the bold syntax to prevent formatting. The parser should ignore escaped asterisks that are meant to appear as literal asterisks rather than as formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Bold Markers**: There might be instances where the asterisk is used in the text but not as bold markers (e.g., `* item` in a list). The parser should not misinterpret these as bold text.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold text that spans multiple lines might pose a challenge as the parser has to handle line breaks within the bold segments without breaking the formatting.\n\n6. **Handling other ORG metadata**: ORG files may contain metadata, timestamps, and other directives. The parser must ignore these and focus solely on the content to find bold texts.\n\n7. **Performance Issues**: If the ORG file is large, it might take some time to process the entire file, so performance optimizations may be necessary for a quick response.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, the parser can provide accurate extraction of bold texts from the ORG file.
