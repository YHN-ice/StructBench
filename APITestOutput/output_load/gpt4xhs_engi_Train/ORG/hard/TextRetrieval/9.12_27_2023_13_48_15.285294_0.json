We must ensure we capture all parts that are bold, even if they are not complete sentences.\n\n5. **Line Breaks:** Bold text might span multiple lines, so we need to make sure the parser can handle multiline bold text correctly.\n\n6. **Contextual Formatting:** The meaning of asterisks can change depending on the context (e.g., they could represent a list item or a section heading).
