It will be important to correctly parse the bold text without including the surrounding formatting.\n3.

The parser must distinguish when asterisks are used for bold formatting and when they are not.\n4. Multi-line bold text: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser should handle this properly and extract the full text.\n5.
