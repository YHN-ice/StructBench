However, if the ORG file uses a non-standard way of marking bold text, it could be challenging to parse correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements (like italic, underline, code, etc.), which could complicate the extraction process. I would need to ensure that only the bold formatting is considered while ignoring other formatting.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: If the bold text contains special characters or symbols that are also used as markup characters in ORG files (like asterisks or slashes), it might confuse the parser. Special care must be taken to differentiate between markup and actual content.\n\n4. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Sometimes, formatted text might span multiple lines or include additional whitespace. The parser must handle these cases correctly without breaking the bold formatting.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Users might escape formatting characters to use them as literals in the text. The parser must recognize escape sequences and not treat escaped characters as formatting markup.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the file is not consistently formatted (for example, mismatched pairs of asterisks), it may lead to incorrect or incomplete extraction of bold text.\n\n7. **Large Files and Performance**: If the ORG file is large, there could be performance concerns. Efficient parsing algorithms and memory management will be necessary to handle large files.\n\nTo navigate these obstacles, it's important to have a robust parsing algorithm that can accurately identify the start and end of bold text while dealing with the nuances of the ORG file format. Once I see the input file, I can determine the appropriate approach to extract all bold texts."
