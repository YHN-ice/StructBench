For instance, image links could be plain URLs, they could be enclosed in double square brackets, or they could have descriptive text associated with them.\n\n2. **Path Types**: The path to the image file can vary; it could be an absolute path, a relative path, or even a URL. Depending on what the question is asking for, different handling might be needed.\n\n3. **Image Formats**: There are many image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), so the parser needs to recognize all possible image extensions that it considers valid for extraction.\n\n4. **Non-Image Links**: An ORG file may contain links to non-image files, so the parser must differentiate between image file links and other types of links.\n\n5. **Embedded Images**: Images might not only be linked but also embedded in different ways, such as base64 encoded images within the file, which might be more challenging to extract.\n\n6. **Image References Not as Links**: Sometimes images might not be included as a standard link but referenced in a way specific to the ORG markup, such as through macros or specific ORG mode constructs.\n\n7. **File Size and Memory Management**: If the ORG file is large and contains many images, it could pose issues for memory management when processing the file.\n\n8. **Character Encoding**: If the ORG file uses a character encoding different from the system's default, special care must be taken to correctly handle file names that include non-ASCII characters.\n\n9. **Error Handling**: The ORG file might be incorrectly formatted or contain broken links. The parser must gracefully handle errors without crashing.\n\n10. **Performance**: If efficiency is a concern, the parser must be optimized to quickly extract image filenames from large ORG files without excessive resource consumption.\n\nWhen you're ready to proceed and have access to the input file, I'll need to parse it accordingly to extract and list the image file names."
