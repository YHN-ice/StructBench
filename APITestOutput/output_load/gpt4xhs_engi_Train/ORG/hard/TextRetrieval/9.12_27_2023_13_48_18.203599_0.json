In-line Formatting: Bold text might appear in the middle of a line, not necessarily on its own line, so the parser needs to handle in-line formatting.\n\n3. Nested Formatting: Sometimes, bold text might have other formatting nested within it, such as `/italic/` or `_underline_`, which could complicate extraction.\n\n4. Special Characters: If the bold text contains special characters or symbols that are also used for formatting (like `*`), the parser must correctly interpret these characters as part of the text and not as formatting delimiters.\n\n5. Multiple Bold Segments: A single line may contain multiple segments of bold text separated by non-bold text, and the parser must extract each bold segment individually.\n\n6. Escaped Characters: Users might escape formatting characters (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`) to include them as literal characters in the text. The parser needs to differentiate between escaped and unescaped formatting delimiters.\n\n7. Inconsistent Formatting: Human errors or deviations from standard formatting could result in inconsistent application of bold syntax, and the parser needs to be robust enough to handle these.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, I'll need to see the actual ORG file content to identify how bold texts are formatted within it."
