The parser should distinguish between these cases.\n\n4. **File format recognition**: The parser needs to recognize various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) since ORG files could include a variety of image types.\n\n5. **Multi-line links**: Sometimes links (including those for images) are broken up over multiple lines for formatting reasons. The parser must be able to handle and correctly parse these cases.\n\n6. **Markup complexity**: ORG files support rich markup which might include comments or other elements that obscure image links. The parser must be capable of ignoring irrelevant markup and focus on extracting image paths.\n\n7. **Encoding issues**: If the ORG file is not encoded in UTF-8 or contains non-standard characters, it might lead to issues while parsing.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parser must be robust and flexible, with the ability to handle different scenarios that could occur in an ORG file's structure and content."
