If the \"EC\" tag belongs to a specific namespace, the parser needs to be aware of this to correctly identify the tag.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: If the XML file uses an encoding that is not supported by the parser or if it's not correctly specified in the XML declaration, this could lead to parsing errors or incorrect interpretation of the content.\n\n5. **Complex Hierarchies**: Deeply nested or complex XML structures might make it difficult to extract information easily and could require more advanced parsing techniques.\n\n6. **DTDs and Schemas**: The XML file may be governed by a DTD (Document Type Definition) or an XML Schema, which defines the structure of the document. The parser might need to validate the XML against these definitions, which can be an additional complexity.\n\n7. **CDATA Sections**: Text within a CDATA section is not parsed by the parser as XML, which means special characters and markup inside CDATA are not treated as markup.
