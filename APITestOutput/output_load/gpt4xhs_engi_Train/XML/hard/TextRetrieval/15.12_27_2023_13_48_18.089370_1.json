The parser must respect case sensitivity or normalize the cases as required.\n\n5. **Nested Elements:** The desired attribute could be within a deeply nested structure, requiring the parser to traverse the XML hierarchy.\n\n6. **Encoding:** If the XML file uses a character encoding that's not properly declared or supported by the parser, it could lead to incorrect parsing of the content.\n\n7. **Large Files:** If the XML file is large, it could pose performance issues for the parser, especially if it's not optimized for large datasets.\n\n8. **Value Containment:** There might be attributes with values containing 'ly' as a substring but not equal to 'ly' (e.g., 'lovely', 'family'). The parser must ensure it is looking for an exact match rather than a substring match.\n\n9. **Attribute Occurrence:** The 'ly' value could occur in multiple tags, and the requirement might be to find all occurrences or just a specific one. Clarification might be needed.\n\n10. **Special Characters:** If 'ly' includes special characters or entities (like '&ly;'), the parser must handle these correctly.\n\nWithout the actual XML content, addressing these obstacles is speculative.
