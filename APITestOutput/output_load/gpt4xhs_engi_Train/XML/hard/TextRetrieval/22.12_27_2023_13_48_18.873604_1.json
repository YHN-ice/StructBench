However, I can certainly guide you through the process of parsing an XML file to find a tag with a specific attribute value. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when parsing an XML file to find a tag with an attribute of value \"gx\":\n\n1. **Complex XML Structure**: XML files can have deeply nested structures which may make it harder to locate the specific tag without a good understanding of the XML hierarchy or without using proper XML parsing tools.\n\n2. **Multiple Attributes**: If tags have multiple attributes, it might be difficult to identify the correct attribute that should match the value \"gx\".\n\n3. **Namespace Declarations**: XML namespaces are used to avoid name conflicts in XML documents. If the attribute belongs to a particular namespace, you'd need to handle namespaces correctly.\n\n4. **Multiple Occurrences**: There may be multiple tags with the same attribute value \"gx\", so you'll need to determine if you're looking for the first occurrence, all occurrences, or if there are specific criteria to identify the correct one.\n\n5. **Similar Attribute Values**: There might be similar attributes with values like \"gx1\", \"gx-foo\", etc., which can cause confusion if not handled carefully.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the XML file uses a non-standard encoding, it might cause issues when trying to read and parse the file correctly.\n\n7. **File Size**: Very large XML files can pose performance issues when parsing, making it necessary to use efficient parsing techniques such as SAX (Simple API for XML) which doesn't load the whole document into memory.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is essential to manage situations where the XML file may be malformed or does not conform to the expected schema.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would typically use an XML parser in their programming language of choice, like ElementTree in Python, DOM or SAX parser in Java, or XmlDocument in .NET. These parsers provide functionality to navigate through elements and attributes efficiently, handle namespaces, and deal with errors gracefully."
