Inconsistent attribute naming: There might be inconsistencies in how attributes are named across different tags, making it difficult to search for them without knowing the exact attribute name associated with the value \"jx\".\n5. Multiple attributes: A tag could have multiple attributes, and pinpointing which one has the value \"jx\" might require examining all of them.\n6.
