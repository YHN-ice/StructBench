If the XML uses namespaces, the parser must be aware of these to correctly reference elements.\n\n3. **Encoding Issues**: If the XML file uses a character encoding that is not properly declared or supported, it could lead to incorrect interpretation of the content.\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the XML file is very large, it could be challenging to process it efficiently, especially if the entire file needs to be loaded into memory.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Malformed XML**: If the XML file is incomplete, corrupted, or not well-formed (i.e., it doesn't follow the XML standard syntax), parsing might fail or yield incorrect results.\n\n6. **Presence of CDATA Sections**: CDATA sections are used to include text data that should not be parsed by the XML parser. If the content of the SB tag is within a CDATA section, it should be extracted as-is, without parsing.\n\n7. **Entity References**: Special characters and symbols may be encoded as entity references in XML.
