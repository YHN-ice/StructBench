Multiple occurrences: If there are multiple tags with attributes that have the value 'g', additional context or criteria would be needed to determine which one you're asking about.\n\n3. Hierarchical structure: XML documents are hierarchical.

Variations in attribute representation: Attributes can be represented with single or double quotes, and sometimes additional whitespace or other variations in formatting can exist which can affect simple parsing mechanisms.\n\n7.
