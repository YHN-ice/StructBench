Closing tags are missing for many elements, such as `<I>`, `<J>`, `<M>`, `<N>`, `<P>`, `<FB>`, `<KB>`, `<MB>`, `<RB>`, `<UB>`, `<VB>`, `<CC>`, `<DC>`, `<JC>`, and more.\n\n2.

For example, the text \"groot essence\" and \"jargon halo\" are not enclosed within any child tags and directly follow an element start tag.\n\n3. Some elements are not properly nested. For example, `<H>` is not closed before opening `<D>`, and `<R>` is open within another `<R>` without proper closure.\n\n4. Text content \"cafe\" appears after the closing of the `<D>` tag and before the start of the `<R>` tag, which is not enclosed within any element.\n\nThese are just a few examples identified in the structure, and a thorough review of each section of the XML is required to fix all errors.
