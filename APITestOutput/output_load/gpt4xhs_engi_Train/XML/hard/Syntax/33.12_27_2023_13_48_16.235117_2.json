Missing closing tags or tags that don't match (e.g., `<book>` and `</books>`) are errors.\n\n2. Case sensitivity: XML tags are case-sensitive. Opening and closing tags must match exactly in terms of case (`<Book>` and `</book>` would be incorrect).\n\n3. Missing quotes around attribute values: Values of attributes should always be enclosed in quotes.\n\n4. Nested tags incorrectly: Tags must be properly nested within each other. For example, `<b><i></b></i>` is incorrect; it should be `<b><i></i></b>`.\n\n5. Special characters not escaped: Characters like \"<\", \">\", \"&\", \"'\", and \"\"\" must be escaped using entities like `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&apos;`, and `&quot;` respectively.\n\n6.
