A common error is when these tags are mismatched or a closing tag is missing.\n\n2. Incorrect nesting of elements: Elements must be properly nested within each other. For example, if an element A contains element B, the closing tag of B must come before the closing tag of A.\n\n3. Illegal characters: Certain characters like \"<\" and \"&\" must be escaped because they have special meanings in XML.\n\n4. Attribute errors: Attributes within the opening tag of an element must be quoted correctly, and there should not be duplicate attributes.\n\n5. Encoding issues: The XML declaration at the beginning of the file might specify an encoding, and the actual content of the file must match this encoding.\n\n6. Syntax errors: XML is case-sensitive, so tags with different cases are considered different.\n\nWithout seeing the XML content, I can't provide a specific answer to whether there are structural errors or not.
