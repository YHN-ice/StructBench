If the quotes are missing, it is a structural error.\n\n4. **Duplicate Attributes**: An element cannot have two attributes with the same name; this would be considered a structural error.\n\n5. **Special Character Handling**: Special characters like `&`, `<`, `>`, etc., must be escaped or contained within a CDATA section. If these are not handled correctly, they can cause structural errors.\n\n6. **XML Declaration Issues**: If present, the XML declaration must be at the beginning of the document, and it must be properly formatted.\n\n7. **Invalid Characters**: XML has a specific set of valid characters.
