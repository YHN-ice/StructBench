For example, control characters in the range of 0-31 except for tab, newline, and carriage return are not allowed.\n\n7. **XML Declaration Issues**: An XML declaration, if present, must be at the beginning of the file, and it must be properly formed (e.g., `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>`).\n\n8. **DOCTYPE Declaration**: If a DOCTYPE is declared, it must be properly formatted and must appear before any content in the XML file.\n\n9. **Namespace Declarations**: If namespaces are used, they must be declared before being used in the XML elements or attributes.\n\nTo check the XML against these potential issues, you would typically use an XML parser or validator, which would automatically signal any such structural errors.
