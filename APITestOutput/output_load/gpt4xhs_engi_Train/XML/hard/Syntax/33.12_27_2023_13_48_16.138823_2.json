Missing closing tags for several elements, which include but may not be limited to:\n    - The `<F>` element is never closed.\n    - The `<G>` element is never closed.\n    - The `<H>` element is never closed.\n    - The `<K>` element is opened twice and closed once, the second opening should be a closing tag instead.\n    - The `<M>` element is never closed.\n    - The `<O>` element is never closed.\n    - The `<R>` element is never closed.\n    - The `<U>` element is never closed.\n    - The `<V>`, `<W>`, `<Z>` tags are opened without corresponding closing tags.\n    - The `<BB>`, `<EB>`, `<KB>`, `<NB>`, `<OB>`, `<RB>`, `<TB>`, `<UB>`, `<VB>`, `<ZB>`, `<GC>`, and other elements are also missing their closing tags.\n\n2. Mismatched or incorrect tag names:\n    - The `<M>` element has an attribute `M=\"qy\"` which is likely meant to be the `id` or another attribute, as repeating the element name as an attribute is unconventional and could be a typo.\n    - The `</AC>` tag does not have a corresponding opening tag.\n    \n3. Incorrect hierarchy and nesting:\n    - Text content and elements are not properly nested within their parent elements. For example, \"essence\" appears between the `<G>` and `<H>` tags without being enclosed in any element.\n    - Elements such as `<R>`, `<Z>`, and others are started inside of a parent but then subsequent siblings are added without closing the previous tag first.\n\nXML relies on correct nesting and well-formedness, meaning that every tag that is opened must be properly closed in the correct order.
