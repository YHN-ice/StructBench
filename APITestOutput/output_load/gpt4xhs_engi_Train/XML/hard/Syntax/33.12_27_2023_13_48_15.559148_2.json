Nesting errors: Elements must be properly nested within each other. If an inner element is closed before an outer element, it's a nesting error.\n\n3. Mismatched tag names: The opening and closing tags for an element must match exactly, including case sensitivity.\n\n4. Missing quotes around attribute values: In XML, the values of attributes must be enclosed in quotes (single or double).\n\n5. Improper use of special characters: Special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and `\"` must be escaped using entities like `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&apos;`, and `&quot;`.\n\n6. Misplaced or incorrect declarations: An XML declaration, if present, must be at the beginning of the document, and it must be properly formatted.\n\n7.
