For example, the `<G>`, `<H>`, `<I>`, `<J>`, `<M>`, `<N>`, `<O>`, `<Q>`, `<V>`, `<W>`, `<X>`, `<Y>`, `<CB>`, `<DB>`, `<FB>`, `<MB>`, `<OB>`, `<VB>`, `<ZB>`, `<AC>`, `<BC>`, `<CC>`, `<DC>`, `<GC>`, `<HC>`, and `<IC>` elements are all opened but never closed with corresponding end-tags.\n\n2. Elements are not properly nested within each other. For instance, the opening `<G>` tag is inside the `<F>` element, but its corresponding content and a closing tag are missing before the opening of the next element (`<H>`), which is also not properly closed before the opening of `<I>`.\n\n3. The XML content ends with an `apple` text node that is not wrapped within any tags, making it unclear where it is supposed to be located within the hierarchy.\n\nTo correct these issues, every element that has been opened should be closed in the proper order, ensuring that elements are correctly nested. All text nodes should also be placed correctly within their respective parent elements."
