For example, if tag `<b>` is opened inside tag `<a>`, then `<b>` must be closed before `<a>` is closed.\n\n4. **Attribute Quoting**: The values of attributes must be enclosed in quotes (either single or double).\n\n5. **Special Character Escaping**: Special characters like `\"`, `'`, `&`, `<`, and `>` in text content or attribute values must be escaped using the proper entity references.\n\n6. **Duplicate Attributes**: An element should not have duplicate attributes.\n\n7. **Unique ID Constraints**: If the XML schema or DTD defines that an attribute of type ID must be unique within the XML document, having duplicate IDs would be an error.\n\n8. **Improper Case Sensitivity**: XML tags are case-sensitive.
