Mismatched Tags: Every opening tag in XML must have a corresponding closing tag. A common error is when tags are mismatched or improperly nested.\n\n2. Missing Quotes: Attribute values must be enclosed in quotes. Missing quotes around an attribute value can cause a structural error.\n\n3. Undefined Entities: If an XML document uses an entity that is not defined, it can lead to an error.\n\n4. Invalid Characters: Certain characters like \"<\" and \"&\" must be escaped in XML. If these characters are used incorrectly, they can cause problems.\n\n5. Improper Encoding: The encoding specified in the XML declaration must match the actual encoding of the document. A mismatch can lead to errors when parsing.\n\n6. Duplicated Attribute Names: Within a single element, you cannot have multiple attributes with the same name.\n\n7. Incorrect Root Element: An XML document should have a single root element that encloses all other elements.\n\n8. Missing XML Declaration: While not strictly required, an XML declaration is highly recommended and the absence of one could be considered a poor practice or potential error in some contexts.\n\n9. Inconsistent Case Sensitivity: XML tags are case-sensitive, so inconsistent use of case in element names can be a problem.\n\n10. Extra Content Outside the Root Element: All content should be inside the root element, and anything outside can cause an error.\n\nReady to see the input file?
