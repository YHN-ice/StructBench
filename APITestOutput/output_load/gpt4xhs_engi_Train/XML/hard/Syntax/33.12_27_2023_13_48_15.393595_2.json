Multiple attributes should be separated by a space. An error could arise from missing quotes or improperly formatted attributes.\n\n5. **Missing root element**: An XML document must have one and only one root element that encloses all other elements.\n\n6. **Improper case sensitivity**: XML tags are case-sensitive.

        "True. There are several structural errors in the provided XML input:\n\n1. Mismatched or unclosed tags: Many tags do not have corresponding closing tags, such as `<H>`, `<I>`, `<M>`, `<N>`, `<O>`, `<P>`, `<Q>`, `<Z>`, `<CB>`, `<DB>`, `<EB>`, `<FB>`, `<NB>`, `<OB>`, `<SB>`, and many more throughout the XML structure.\n\n2. Incorrect nesting of elements: Some elements are not closed before their parent elements are closed, resulting in incorrect nesting. For example, within the `<F>` element, the `</F>` closing tag is missing before the opening `<G>` tag.\n\n3. Attribute issues: There is an attribute `ZY=\"ty\"` in the opening `<X>` tag which does not follow the pattern of other attributes (it should probably be `ZY=\"ty\"`).\n\n4. Improper case sensitivity: XML tags are case-sensitive, so the opening and closing tags must match in case. However, this XML has matching tags but it's still worth mentioning as a potential issue.\n\n5. Presence of syntax errors: There are texts like \"essence\", \"dentist\", \"oops\", \"kangaroo\", \"cafe\", and \"apple\" not encapsulated within any tags which is not valid within XML documents.\n\nTo correct these errors, each opening tag must have a matching closing tag, proper nesting must be ensured, and any text content must be properly encapsulated within tags."
