An error could be present if a tag is left open or if the nesting order is incorrect.\n\n2. Attribute formatting: Attributes within a tag must be properly formatted, typically as key-value pairs enclosed in quotes. Mistakes in attribute formatting could lead to errors.\n\n3. Special characters: If special characters (like <, >, &, ', \") are not properly escaped or used within CDATA sections, this could cause parsing errors.\n\n4. XML declaration issues: The XML declaration at the beginning of the document should be correct. Errors in the declaration, such as incorrect syntax or encoding specifications, can cause issues.\n\n5. Namespace declarations: If namespaces are used, they need to be declared correctly, and elements need to be properly associated with their respective namespaces.\n\n6.
