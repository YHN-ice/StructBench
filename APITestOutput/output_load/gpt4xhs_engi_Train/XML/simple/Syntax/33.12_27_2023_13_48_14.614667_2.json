For example, `<element attribute=\"value\">` is correct, while `<element attribute=value>` or `<element attribute='value\">` are incorrect.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: Characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and `\"` have special meanings in XML and must be escaped or put into CDATA sections if they are to be treated as data.\n\n6. **Duplicate IDs**: If ID-type attributes are used, they should be unique within the XML document.\n\n7. **Invalid Characters**: Some characters are not allowed in XML documents and must be properly handled or excluded.\n\n8. **XML Declaration Issues**: If an XML declaration is used (`<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>`), it must be at the beginning of the file, and there can only be one declaration.\n\nTo determine if the XML file has structural errors, I'd need to see the actual content of the file you're referring to.
