In XML, every opening tag must have a closing tag. Examples include `<E>`, `<G>`, `<L>`, and many more.\n\n2. **Improperly Nested Elements**: Elements must be properly nested within each other. For instance, in the provided XML, the `<C>` element is closed after the `<G>` element starts, which is incorrect.\n\n3. **Elements With Missing Closing Angle Brackets**: Some elements, like `<E`, `<G`, and others, are missing the closing angle bracket for the opening tag.\n\n4. **Incorrect Element Hierarchy**: Elements should follow a proper hierarchy and structure. The closing tags should be in the correct order to maintain a well-formed structure.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Indentation**: While inconsistency in indentation does not necessarily cause a parsing error, it makes the XML harder to read and can lead to mistakes when editing or reviewing the XML content.\n\nOverall, this XML does not meet the well-formedness criteria and contains multiple structural errors.
