For instance, the `<D>`, `<E>`, `<F>`, `<G>`, `<H>`, `<N>`, `<R>`, `<S>`, `<T>`, `<U>`, `<V>`, `<W>`, `<EB>`, `<FB>`, `<GB>`, `<HB>`, `<JB>`, `<KB>`, `<LB>`, `<MB>`, `<NB>`, `<OB>`, `<PB>`, `<QB>`, `<RB>`, `<SB>`, `<TB>`, `<VB>`, `<WB>`, `<XB>`, `<YB>`, `<ZB>`, `<AC>`, `<BC>`, `<CC>`, `<DC>`, `<EC>`, `<GC>`, and more do not have corresponding closing tags.\n\n2. **Incorrectly Nested Tags**: Some tags appear to be incorrectly nested, such as opening a new tag before closing the previous one, which leads to overlapping elements. For example, after opening the tag `<D>` directly the tag `<E>` is opened without closing the tag `<D>`.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Element Structure**: It appears that multiple instances of the same element have different structures. This isn't an error in well-formedness per se, but it could lead to issues if the XML is meant to conform to a specific schema that requires consistency.\n\nXML should be structured in a nested manner where each tag that is opened is properly closed before a new one at the same level is opened. In addition, all elements at a deeper level should be closed before the parent element is closed. The errors mentioned above violate these principles, making the XML malformed.\n\nTo fix these errors, every open tag needs to have a corresponding closing tag in the correct order, maintaining proper nesting throughout the document."
