Many tags are not closed properly, for example:\n- The `<D>` tag is not closed.\n- The `<E>` tag is not closed.\n- The `<F>` tag is not closed.\n- The `<G>` tag is not closed.\n- And so on, with multiple other tags like `<K>`, `<L>`, `<N>`, `<O>`, `<P>`, `<Q>`, `<R>`, `<S>`, `<T>`, `<U>`, `<V>`, `<TB>`, `<UB>`, `<VB>`, `<AC>`, `<BC>`, `<DC>`, `<EC>`, `<FC>`, etc.\n\n2. There is also incorrect nesting, where children tags are not properly nested within their parent tags. For example, tag `<E>` starts within tag `<D>` but is not closed before tag `<F>` starts.\n\n3. Text content appears after a closing tag without being wrapped in an element, for example, \"banana\" and \"cafe\" appear after closing tags without being enclosed in any element.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are similar issues throughout the provided XML.
