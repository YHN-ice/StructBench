However, as I am a text-based AI and not an actual XML file parser tool, I'll describe some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered during this process:\n\n1. **Complex XML Structure:** If the XML file has a very nested or complex structure, finding the correct tag may require careful navigation through the hierarchy of elements.\n\n2. **Multiple Attributes**: A tag might have multiple attributes, so it's necessary to inspect each attribute of every tag to find the one that matches the value 'wy'.\n\n3. **Namespaces:** XML namespaces can add complexity to the parsing process. If elements or attributes are within different namespaces, they must be handled correctly.\n\n4. **Similar Attribute Values:** There may be multiple attributes with values that are similar or contain 'wy' as part of a larger string, requiring precise matching to find an exact value.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity:** XML is case-sensitive, so searching for 'wy' is different from 'Wy' or 'WY'. The parser must be case-sensitive or adjust its search accordingly.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues:** If the XML file uses a different encoding than the parser expects, there can be issues with interpreting characters correctly.\n\n7. **Presence of CDATA Sections:** CDATA sections in XML are used to include text data that should not be parsed. If the attribute value 'wy' is within a CDATA section, it might be missed by the parser.\n\n8. **XML File Size:** A very large XML file could pose performance issues, making the parsing process slow, particularly if it's not possible to stream the file and it must be loaded into memory in its entirety.\n\n9. **Invalid XML:** If the XML file is not well-formed or valid according to its schema or DTD, it could cause errors during parsing.\n\nTo address these challenges, an XML parser would need to be robust, handle errors gracefully, and be equipped with features to navigate and search through the XML content accurately. If you provide the XML content, I can simulate the parsing process and help you identify the tag with the attribute of value 'wy'."
