Namespaces: If the XML document uses namespaces, it could be challenging to identify the correct element without considering the namespace it belongs to.\n\n3. Large Files: If the XML file is very large, it could be difficult to efficiently locate and extract the relevant information without proper parsing tools or methodologies.\n\n4. Encoding Issues: The file might use a character encoding that is not properly declared or supported, leading to incorrectly interpreted text.\n\n5. Ambiguity: There might be multiple tags with the same name (i.e., `QB`), and without context or additional criteria, it could be unclear which one is being referenced.\n\n6. Attributes vs. Text: Content within a tag might include text, child elements, and/or attributes. It's essential to clarify whether the question refers to text content only or also includes attributes and nested elements.\n\n7.
