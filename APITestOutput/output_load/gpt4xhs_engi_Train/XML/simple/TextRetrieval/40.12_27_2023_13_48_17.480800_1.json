Determining which one is being asked about could be problematic without additional context.\n\n3. **Attribute Ambiguity:**\n   The attribute name was not specified. If there are multiple attributes within various tags, and more than one of them has a value of 'c', it would be unclear which one you are referring to.\n\n4. **Nested Elements:**\n   If the XML structure is deeply nested, finding the correct tag may require navigating through several layers of elements.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Malformed XML:**\n   If the XML provided is incomplete or not well-formed (e.g., missing closing tags, mismatched tag names), parsing it correctly to find the attribute value would be challenging.\n\n6. **Special Characters and Encoding:**\n   XML entities and special characters might need to be handled or decoded to properly interpret attribute values or tag names.\n\n7. **Large Files and Memory Management:**\n   If the XML file is very large, it could pose issues with memory management during parsing, though this should not be a concern for simple parsing tasks.\n\n8. **Schema or DTD Validation:**\n   Depending on the context, it might be necessary to validate the XML against a schema or DTD to ensure that the structure and content follow a specific model, which can complicate parsing if validation fails.\n\n9. **Correct Interpretation of the Task:**\n   Understanding exactly what is being asked is crucial. For example, does \"tag with attribute of value c\" mean any tag with any attribute that has the value 'c', or is it looking for a specific attribute name?\n\nOnce you provide the XML file or further context about the tag and attributes in question, these obstacles can be addressed in order to extract the needed information."
