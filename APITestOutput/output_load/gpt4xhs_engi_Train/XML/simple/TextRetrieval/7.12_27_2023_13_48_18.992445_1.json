I need to make sure I am matching the case accurately.\n\n6. **Incomplete or Malformed XML:** If the input XML is incomplete or not well-formed (e.g., missing closing tags, unquoted attribute values), it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Entity References & Special Characters:** Handling special characters and entity references in XML can be tricky, and they need to be properly parsed to avoid misinterpretation.\n\n8. **Attributes Spread Over Multiple Lines:** Attributes might be spread over multiple lines, which can complicate the parsing if the parser doesn't handle multi-line attributes well.\n\n9. **Performance Issues:** If the XML file is very large, there might be performance implications for reading and processing the file.\n\n10. **API Limitations:** Depending on the API or tool used for parsing, there might be limitations or quirks that affect the ability to find tags by their attributes effectively.\n\nThese are some of the obstacles I might face.
