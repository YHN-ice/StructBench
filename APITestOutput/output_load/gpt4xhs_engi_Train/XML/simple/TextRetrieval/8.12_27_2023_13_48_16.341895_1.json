If these are missing or incorrect (for example, using a single quote when the rest of the document uses double quotes), it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n8. **Encoding issues**: If the XML file is not properly encoded (for example, it's supposed to be UTF-8 but contains characters from a different encoding), this might lead to misinterpretation of the characters within the attribute values.\n\nPlease provide the XML file or describe its structure so I can analyze it and answer your question regarding the tag with an attribute of value \"xx\"."
