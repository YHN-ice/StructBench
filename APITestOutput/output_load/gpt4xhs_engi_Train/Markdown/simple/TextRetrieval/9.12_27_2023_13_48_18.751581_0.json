We need to account for both possibilities.\n\n2. **Nested elements**: Bold text might have other Markdown elements nested within it, such as italics, inline code, or links. We'll need to identify just the bold text while acknowledging that it may contain other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users might escape asterisks or underscores to display them literally rather than as formatting, e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`. We need to differentiate actual bold syntax from escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incorrectly closed tags**: Sometimes the closing tag for bold might be missing or incorrect, which could cause parsing issues. We'll need to decide how to handle these situations.\n\n5. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which could complicate extraction because some parsers might expect inline formatting to be contained within a single line.\n\n6. **Ambiguity with list items and headings**: Asterisks are also used for creating list items and could lead to confusion with bold syntax. Similarly, underscores are common in filenames and URLs which might be mistaken as bold syntax.\n\n7. **Partial formatting overlaps**: There may be overlapping formatting where part of a bold section is also italicized or struck through, etc., which can add complexity to parsing.\n\n8. **False positives due to context**: Text that appears to follow the bold pattern might be part of a code block or quoted section where formatting shouldn't be applied.\n\nIdentifying and correctly handling these scenarios is key to accurately extracting all the bold texts from a Markdown file. Now, please provide the Markdown content so that I can proceed with the parsing task."
