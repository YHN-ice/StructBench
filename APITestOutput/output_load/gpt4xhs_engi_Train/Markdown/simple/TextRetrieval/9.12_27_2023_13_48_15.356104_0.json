Different Markdown syntaxes for bold: Markdown supports multiple ways to make text bold. The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser must be able to recognize both.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text might have other formatting nested inside it, such as italic, code spans, or links, which might complicate the extraction process. For instance, `**this is _very_ important**`.\n\n3. Escaped characters: Double asterisks or underscores used in a different context might be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), so they shouldn't be confused with actual bold formatting.\n\n4. Inconsistent spacing: Some Markdown parsers allow for spaces after the opening and before the closing markers (e.g., `** bold **`). However, this is not universally supported and could lead to inconsistencies.\n\n5. Multi-line bold: Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser must be able to handle multi-line patterns.\n\n6. Incorrect formatting: If the Markdown is incorrectly formatted (e.g., missing one asterisk in what should be a bold pair), it might not be clear whether the text was intended to be bold or not.\n\n7. Overlapping formatting: Bold formatting might overlap with other formatting elements, such as two overlapping bold sections or a bold section that starts within another bold section.\n\nThese issues must be taken into account when designing the parsing strategy to accurately extract all bold texts from the given Markdown file."
