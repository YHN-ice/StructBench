Both need to be recognized and handled.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might have other elements nested inside, such as links `[**bold link**](url)`, or italics `**bold and *italic***`. Extracting just the bold text while discarding nested formatting could be tricky.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that might be part of the bold syntax could be escaped with a backslash `\\`, which means they should not be treated as formatting characters. For example, `\\**not bold**`.\n\n4. **Incomplete Syntax**: There may be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed, such as `**bold text`. Deciding how to handle these cases (ignore or attempt to correct them) could affect the extraction process.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Bold syntax within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks \\`\\`\\`) or inline code (indicated by single backticks `\\`) should not be treated as bold text.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Markdown syntax may span multiple lines, so the parser must be able to correctly identify bold text that is not confined to a single line.\n\n7. **False Positives**: There may be instances where double asterisks or underscores are used in the text not to denote bold text but for other purposes. The parser needs to differentiate these cases.\n\n8. **Compatibility with Extended Markdown**: Some Markdown flavors have extended syntax, and ensuring compatibility with these variations might also pose challenges.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be robust enough to handle various edge cases and accurately extract only the bold text as intended in the Markdown syntax. Now, please provide the input file or content for further assistance."
