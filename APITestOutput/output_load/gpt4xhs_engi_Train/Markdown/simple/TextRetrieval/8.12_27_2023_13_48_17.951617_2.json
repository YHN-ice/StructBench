This means the parser needs to resolve references properly.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown supports inline HTML, so images might be embedded using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Links vs. Images**: Distinguishing between image links and actual embedded images might be tricky, as the syntax is quite similar to that of links. An image link would not have an image file as an output.\n\n5. **File Path Extraction**: Once an image is identified, extracting the file path or URL correctly, ignoring optional titles or alt text, might be challenging.\n\n6. **Encoded URLs**: URLs for images might be encoded or include query parameters that need to be handled correctly.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line, which requires proper parsing to extract each image file name separately.\n\nOnce we see the input file content, we'll have a clearer idea of which obstacles we're actually dealing with."
