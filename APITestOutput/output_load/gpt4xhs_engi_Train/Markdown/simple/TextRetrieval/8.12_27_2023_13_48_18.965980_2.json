The most common is `![Alt text](URL)` but variations might exist, such as with or without alt text, or using reference-style links.\n\n2. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might embed HTML tags directly, and images could be included using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be linked using absolute URLs (which include the protocol and domain name) or relative paths (which relate to the file's location). Care must be taken to extract meaningful paths regardless of how they're presented.\n\n4. **Linking to External Resources**: Some links might not be to image files but rather to web pages or other resources that are not direct image file links.\n\n5. **File Extensions**: Recognizing what constitutes an image file might require looking for common image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). However, some images might not have an extension in the URL.\n\n6. **Text that Looks Like an Image Link**: Sometimes, text in a Markdown document might coincidentally follow a pattern that looks like an image link but isn't meant to be one, such as code snippets or examples.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be several images on a single line, and the parser must be able to handle this.\n\n8. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: The parser must handle images correctly even if the syntax is broken across multiple lines or contains extra whitespace.\n\n9. **Images in Lists or Blockquotes**: Images might be nested within lists or blockquotes, which could affect the way they're parsed.\n\n10. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown formatting might be escaped within image paths or alt text, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n11. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: Different flavors of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown) may have slight variations in how images are embedded or handled.\n\nTo accurately extract image filenames, the parser must account for these potential complications and ensure it applies the correct rules to identify and extract only those links that point to image files."
