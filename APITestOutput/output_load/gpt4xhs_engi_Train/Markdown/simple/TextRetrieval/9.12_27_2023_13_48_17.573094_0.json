However, there can be several challenges and obstacles, such as:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Flavors**: Different Markdown flavors might have different ways to denote bold text. The most common way is using double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` before and after the text. We need to know which flavor or which method is used in the input file.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting within it, such as links, italics, or inline code. The parser needs to be able to handle nested formatting and still extract the bold text correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users may escape bold syntax characters to prevent them from being parsed as bold, e.g., `**not bold**`. These should not be considered as bold text.\n\n4. **False Positives**: In some cases, asterisks or underscores might be used for other purposes, such as in bullet lists or horizontal rules, and not for bold text. The parser must differentiate between these uses.\n\n5. **Incomplete Markers**: There might be cases where the markers for bold text are not complete or mismatched (for example, `**bold*`), which can make extraction of bold text difficult.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser should be able to handle multiline text that is meant to be bold.\n\n7. **Adjacent Bold Sections**: Sometimes, two separate bold sections may be adjacent to each other with no space in between (`**bold1****bold2**`). The parser needs to identify these as separate instances of bold text.\n\nOnce the input file is made available, we can go through the content and apply the appropriate regular expressions or parsing logic to extract the bold texts while handling the potential difficulties mentioned above."
