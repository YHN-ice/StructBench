For example, a text like `![Not an Image](thisisnotanimage)` could potentially mislead a simple string search.\n\n10. **Multiline Links**: In rare cases, the link for an image might be broken across multiple lines, which would require a more sophisticated multiline parsing strategy.\n\nWith these potential challenges in mind, I'm ready to look at the input file and begin extracting the image filenames.
