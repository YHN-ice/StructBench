The two most common are using double asterisks `**bold**` or double underscores `__bold__`. The parser must be able to handle both methods.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting inside it, such as italic (`*italic*` or `_italic_`), code spans (`` `code` ``), or even links (`[link text](URL)`). The parser must be able to extract the bold text without being confused by nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are used in a non-formatting way and are escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold**`). The parser needs to recognize and properly handle these escape characters.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (`` `code` ``) should not be formatted, so if there are asterisks or underscores within a code block, they should not be interpreted as bold markers.\n\n5. **Fenced Code Blocks**: Similar to inline code blocks, text within fenced code blocks (enclosed by triple backticks ``` or triple tildes ~~~) should not be formatted.\n\n6. **Partial Formatting**: There might be instances where the formatting is not properly closed (e.g., `**bold`). Depending on the rules we follow, this may or may not be considered as bold text.\n\n7. **Adjacent Formatting**: There could be cases where bold text is immediately followed by other formatting such as lists, headings, or blockquotes, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. **Variants in Line Breaks**: Line breaks can vary between systems (LF vs. CRLF), and some Markdown renderers might handle these differently, affecting how formatting is applied.\n\n9. **Complexity of the Document Structure**: If the Markdown file contains a complex structure with nested lists, tables, or custom HTML, it might be more difficult to extract text accurately.\n\nBy considering these potential issues ahead of time, it would help in creating a more robust parser that can handle various Markdown scenarios. With this in mind, once I have access to the input file, I'll be able to extract the bold texts accordingly."
