It is necessary to account for all the possible formatting options.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text can also be inside other markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or nested within italic or code spans. Properly parsing these nested elements without losing the bold formatting can be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes the asterisk or underscore characters might be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being parsed as formatting (`\\**not bold\\**`), which means they should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n4. **False positives**: There might be instances where asterisks or underscores are used in the text not for formatting purposes but as part of regular content. For example, a sentence could include an asterisk to denote a footnote reference.\n\n5. **Incomplete formatting**: If there is an error in the markdown file where the bold formatting is not properly closed (e.g., `**bold text`), it will be important to decide how to handle such cases—whether to ignore them or attempt to correct and extract them.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text could span multiple lines, and it is necessary to ensure that the parser correctly identifies and extracts multiline bold segments.\n\n7. **Links and images**: Bold text could also contain links or images with their own syntax, which can complicate extraction if the parser is not designed to handle these cases.\n\nAddressing these obstacles requires a robust parsing approach that can systematically identify and extract bold text while handling edge cases gracefully."
