The most common is `![Alt text](URL \"optional title\")`, but there could be variations or shortcuts in different Markdown flavors.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in a Markdown file can be linked using either relative or absolute paths. Absolute paths may include URLs pointing to external resources, while relative paths refer to files within the same directory structure as the Markdown file.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL reference is defined elsewhere in the document, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, images are embedded using HTML tags (e.g., `<img src=\"image.png\" />`) rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Link Confusion**: Distinguishing between links to web pages and links to image files may require inspection of the URL or file extension.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There may be non-image file URLs or other instances of parentheses that could be misinterpreted as image links if the parsing isn't context-aware.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Identifying image files would typically rely on known image file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`), but sometimes URLs can omit extensions or use query parameters.\n\n8. **Encoding and Escaping**: Special characters in URLs or filenames might be encoded (percent encoding) or escaped, requiring decoding to get the correct filename.\n\n9. **Multiline Links**: Although not standard, some Markdown processors might support image links that are broken up across multiple lines.\n\n10. **Document Structure**: The parser must maintain state correctly to identify links within the document's hierarchy, such as within lists, blockquotes, or code blocks, where they should not be interpreted as images.\n\nTo extract the image filenames effectively, a parser needs to be aware of these potential issues and handle them accordingly."
