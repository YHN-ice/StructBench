The parser must distinguish between them.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters:** It's possible that some image syntax could include escaped characters which should not be interpreted as Markdown.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements:** Images might be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes, which could affect the parsing logic.\n\n8. **Malformed Syntax:** The Markdown file might have malformed image syntax which should either be handled or ignored depending on the requirements.\n\n9. **Textual Noise:** There might be non-image-related text or syntax that could interfere with simple pattern matching approaches (for example, URLs in text that resemble image file paths).\n\nEach of these factors needs to be considered when designing a robust Markdown parsing strategy to accurately extract image file names."
