The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` and double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting like italics, links, or inline code. The parser must correctly extract the bold text without including the syntax for other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users can escape Markdown syntax characters with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). The parser must recognize and properly handle escaped characters so that they are not mistaken for formatting.\n\n4. **False positives**: Text that looks like bold formatting may appear within code blocks or inline code, where it should not be formatted as bold. The parser must differentiate between text that should be formatted and text that is part of a code snippet.\n\n5. **Incomplete formatting**: Sometimes users may make syntax errors, such as using only one asterisk or forgetting to close the syntax with another pair of asterisks. Depending on the requirements, the parser might need to handle these gracefully or ignore them.\n\n6. **Adjacent formatting**: Bold syntax can be directly adjacent to other characters or punctuation without spaces (e.g., `**bold**text`). The parser should be able to handle these cases without including adjacent characters in the extracted text.\n\n7. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser must be able to extract such text as well.\n\nNow that we've considered potential difficulties, you can provide the input file, and I'll work on extracting all bold texts while keeping these challenges in mind."
