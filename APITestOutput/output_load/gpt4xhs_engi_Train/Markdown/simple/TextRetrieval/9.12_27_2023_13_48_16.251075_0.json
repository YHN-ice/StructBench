The common ones are using two asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. We will have to account for both of these when parsing the file.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text can be nested inside other formatting elements like links, italics, or even other bold tags. For example, `**bold _italic_ text**`. We need to ensure that we capture the bold text without including the other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting, such as `\\**not bold**`. These should not be considered as bold by the parser.\n\n4. **False positives**: Asterisks or underscores might be used in the text for other purposes than bold formatting, like in the case of bullet points or horizontal rules, which could be mistaken for bold formatting.\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text that spans multiple lines might not be parsed correctly since some parsers only look for matches within a single line.\n\n6. **Partial formatting**: Situations where formatting is started but not properly closed off can lead to trouble identifying the intended bold text, like `**bold text`.\n\n7. **Inconsistent formatting**: Users might have errors in their Markdown files where the bold formatting is not consistently applied, such as `**bold__` which would throw off a simple parser.\n\n8. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text inside code blocks (indented with four spaces or surrounded by triple backticks ```) and inline code (surrounded by single backticks) should not be considered for formatting, but a naive parser might still pick it up.\n\nDeveloping a parser that can handle these nuances requires careful design and possibly a multi-pass approach to handle the various layers of formatting and exceptions."
