We need to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images can be in several formats, such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. The parser should recognize different image extensions.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute URLs**: Images can be linked using both relative and absolute URLs. Only the filenames should be extracted, not the entire URL path.\n\n4. **Image URLs with Parameters**: Sometimes image URLs might come with query parameters (e.g., `![Alt](image.png?size=50)`). The parser needs to correctly identify the image filename without the parameters.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs or Special Characters**: URL encoding or special characters in filenames (e.g., spaces, `%20`, etc.) need to be correctly handled to extract the actual filenames.\n\n6. **Images in HTML Tags**: Markdown files may also contain HTML tags with images (`<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" />`). The parser should also recognize these.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Text that looks like an image inclusion but isn't one (e.g., commented-out image links, image links inside code blocks or inline code) should be ignored.\n\n8. **Multiple images in a single line**: Sometimes markdown has multiple images on the same line. The parser should extract all image names from such lines.\n\nThese are just a few potential challenges that might need to be considered while writing a parser to extract image file names from a Markdown file."
