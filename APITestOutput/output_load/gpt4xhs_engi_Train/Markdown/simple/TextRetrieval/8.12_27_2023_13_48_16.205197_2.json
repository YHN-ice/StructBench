The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. However, there may be variations in the syntax, like omitting the alt text or title.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute URLs**: Image sources might be given with absolute URLs (including `http://` or `https://`), or with relative paths. Extracting just the filename would require parsing out the rest of the URL or path.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image tag but is instead defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes Markdown files contain embedded HTML tags, including `<img>` tags. These would require a different parsing approach than standard Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: There may be escaped characters that are part of the image syntax, which need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n6. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There's a possibility that more than one image could be present on a single line, requiring parsing that can handle multiple matches within a line.\n\n7. **Link vs Image Syntax Confusion**: The image syntax in Markdown is similar to link syntax (`[Link text](URL \"Optional title\")`), so care must be taken not to confuse links with images.\n\n8. **Image Titles with Newlines**: If an image title includes a newline character or other formatting within the title string, it might complicate extraction.\n\n9. **Syntax Errors**: The Markdown file might contain syntax errors, like missing parentheses or brackets that would usually denote an image tag, which need to be handled gracefully.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust markdown parser or a series of regular expressions tailored to capture all possible variations of image syntax can be utilized. Once potential matches are found, they can then be further processed to extract just the filename."
