We need to correctly identify all syntaxes used for embedding images.\n\n2. **Reference-style Image Links**: Some Markdown files use reference-style links, where the image reference is defined elsewhere in the document, which can be more challenging to parse as we would need to match the reference to its URL.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Markdown allows embedding HTML, so images could also be included using `<img>` tags. This requires parsing HTML within the Markdown to find image sources.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: If an image syntax is escaped (e.g., `\\![Alt text](URL)`), it is not meant to be an actual image but a text representation of that syntax. We should not treat these as images.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown**: Sometimes, images are included inside other elements like links or lists, which might add complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n6. **Path Formats**: Image paths could be full URLs pointing to a remote resource or local file paths with various directory separators, and they could include query parameters or fragments that are not part of the file name itself.\n\n7. **Duplicate Image References**: The same image might be included multiple times in a document, and we need to decide if we should list duplicates or unique instances.\n\n8. **Incorrect Syntax**: There may be incorrectly formatted image syntaxes which do not actually render an image but look similar to correct ones. We need to decide whether to include these.\n\nThese potential issues should be accounted for when extracting image file names from a Markdown file to ensure accurate results."
