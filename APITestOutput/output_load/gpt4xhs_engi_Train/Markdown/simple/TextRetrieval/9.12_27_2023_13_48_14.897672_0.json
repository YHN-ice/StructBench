For example:\n\n```markdown\n**This is bold text**\n__This is also bold text__\n```\n\nPotential difficulties and obstacles in extracting bold text might include:\n\n1. Inconsistent use of Markdown syntax: If the Markdown file inconsistently uses syntax or uses non-standard ways to denote bold text, it might be difficult to accurately extract all bold instances.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text could be nested within other formatting, such as links, italic text, or strikethroughs, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. Escaped characters: If the Markdown file contains escaped asterisks or underscores (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), they should not be treated as bold formatting, but as literal asterisks or underscores.\n\n4. Alternative formatting: Some Markdown processors support additional syntax for bold text, such as triple asterisks for bold and italic. Identifying these cases might require additional parsing logic.\n\n5. Multi-line bold text: Bold text that spans multiple lines might require special consideration, as the standard Markdown syntax often assumes single-line formatting.\n\nTo properly extract the bold texts, I will need to parse the file line by line, identify the patterns that denote bold formatting, handle any of the above complexities, and extract the text between the formatting markers while maintaining the raw text's integrity."
