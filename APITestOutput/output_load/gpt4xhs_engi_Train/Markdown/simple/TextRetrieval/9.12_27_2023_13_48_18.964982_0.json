Ensuring that all variations are accounted for would be essential.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold syntax could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or headers. The parser must be able to handle such nested structures.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: The presence of escaped characters like `\\**text\\**` might incorrectly be interpreted as bold text. The parser needs to differentiate between escaped and actual formatting characters.\n\n4. **Partial Bold Text**: Text can be partially bold within the same line, for example, `This is **bold** and this is not`. The parser should only extract the bold part.\n\n5. **Link Descriptions and Image Alt Texts**: Bold syntax might appear within link descriptions or image alt texts, which should not be confused with regular bold text.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (indented or fenced with backticks) should not be interpreted as bold, even if it contains characters that would otherwise mark bold text.\n\n7. **False Positives From Non-standard Usage**: Any non-standard usage of asterisks or underscores that coincidentally resembles bold syntax but isn’t intended to create bold text could result in false positives.\n\nAddressing these challenges would typically involve writing a comprehensive regex pattern or using a Markdown parsing library that can handle the complexity of Markdown's syntax.\n"
