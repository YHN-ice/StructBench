The most common is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there can be variations, such as reference-style images.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using HTML tags like `<img src=\"image.jpg\" />`, which need to be parsed differently from standard Markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. Identifying the actual file names might require different handling for each type.\n\n4. **Link References**: Markdown can define images with a reference link elsewhere in the document, so one needs to resolve the reference to the actual URL or file path.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes the image syntax might be escaped to prevent it from being rendered as an image (e.g., `\\!\\[Alt text](URL)`), which should not be counted as an actual image.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown**: Images might be nested inside other elements, like lists or blockquotes, which could make parsing more complex.\n\n7. **Non-image Links**: Ensuring that only image files are extracted and not links to non-image files that happen to be included in the document.\n\nAll these factors must be considered when creating or using a parsing algorithm to extract image file names from Markdown content accurately."
