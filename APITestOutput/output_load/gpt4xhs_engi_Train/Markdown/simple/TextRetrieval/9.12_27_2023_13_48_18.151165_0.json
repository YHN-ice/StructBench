The parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested inside other formatting elements, like links or italic text, which can complicate parsing.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores used as literal characters rather than formatting might be escaped with a backslash. The parser should not confuse these with formatting.\n\n4. **Partial formatting**: Sometimes, a user might mistakenly leave off one asterisk or underscore, resulting in partial formatting that the parser should ignore.\n\n5. **Inline code blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (denoted by backticks `) should not be processed for formatting.\n\n6. **Code blocks and fenced code**: Text within code blocks (indented by four spaces or fenced by triple backticks) should not be processed for formatting.\n\n7. **Lists and blockquotes**: Bold text might appear within lists or blockquotes, and the parser should correctly parse these contexts.\n\n8. **Line breaks**: The Markdown specification allows for line breaks within bold formatting, but some parsers might have trouble if there's a newline character in the middle of bold syntax.\n\n9. **Overlapping format regions**: If there are overlapping format regions (e.g., bold within italic), the parser must handle these correctly without confusion.\n\n10. **False positives**: Text that contains double asterisks or underscores but is not meant to be bold could result in false positives.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, the parser must effectively navigate these potential challenges.
