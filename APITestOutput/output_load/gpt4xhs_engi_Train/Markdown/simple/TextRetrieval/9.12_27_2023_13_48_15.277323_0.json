We have to ensure that the parser can recognize both formats.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, italics, code spans, or even other bold markers. The parser needs to handle these without mistaking nested markers for the end of the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows for escaping characters using a backslash `\\` that might change the interpretation of the following characters. The parser needs to understand and handle escaped characters correctly.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Text**: If the Markdown allows for bold text to span multiple lines, the parser needs to be able to detect and handle this correctly.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be used in the text not to indicate bold formatting but as part of the content itself. The parser should not mistake these for formatting markers.\n\n6. **Incorrect Formatting**: If the Markdown is not correctly formatted (for example, missing a closing marker), the parser needs to decide how to handle such situations – whether to ignore the incorrect formatting or attempt to recover and still identify the intended bold text.\n\nNow, please provide the input file so we can proceed with extracting the bold texts."
