The most common ways are by using two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) before and after the text. For example:\n   - `**bold text**`\n   - `__bold text__`\n\n   Both of these should be identified as bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Sometimes, bold syntax can be nested within other markup elements, such as within a list, blockquote, or even italics. This can complicate parsing because we need to ensure that the bold syntax is correctly identified within these contexts.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows escaping of special characters using a backslash (\\). If a user wants to include literal asterisks or underscores without creating emphasis, they would escape them like so:\n   - `\\**not bold\\**`\n   - `\\__not bold\\__`\n\n   These should not be confused with actual bold text.\n\n4. **Incorrect Syntax**: Sometimes users may incorrectly use the Markdown syntax that will not result in bold text, such as uneven numbers of asterisks or underscores around the text or spaces between the asterisks/underscores and the text:\n   - `**not bold**`\n   - `__ not bold __`\n\n5. **Code Blocks**: Text within inline code (using backticks) or code blocks (indented with four spaces or fenced with triple backticks) should not be considered as formatted text even if they contain what appears to be bold syntax.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: The syntax for links and images may contain asterisks or underscores which should not be mistaken for bold formatting.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, parsing the Markdown file to extract all bold texts accurately requires careful consideration of the context in which the syntax appears."
