We need to determine which ones to extract or if the question pertains to both.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Images might be included using reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might embed HTML for more complex image handling, such as `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"Alt text\">`.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: Image URLs might be URL-encoded or contain special characters that need proper handling.\n\n6. **Link Identifiers**: Sometimes images are linked to other parts of the document or external resources, which may not necessarily be files to extract but might appear in a search for link patterns.\n\n7. **False Positives**: There might be text that resembles the image syntax but isn't meant to be an image, such as a commented-out image link or a code block containing example syntax.\n\n8. **File Extensions**: There might be different file extensions for images (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.), and we need to ensure that we recognize all valid image formats.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Occasionally, images might have Markdown elements nested inside their alt text or title, which could confuse a simple parser looking for patterns.\n\n10. **Escape Characters**: Some image links might include escape characters that need to be handled properly.\n\nThese potential issues must be taken into account when writing a parser to extract image file names from a Markdown file correctly.
