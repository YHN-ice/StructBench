We need to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the syntax characters can be escaped to display literal asterisks or underscores rather than applying formatting. We'll need to discern between formatting and escaped characters.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might also contain other formatting such as italics, strikethrough, or inline code. We must ensure we only extract the text content without including other formatting syntax.\n\n4. **Partial Formatting**: There might be instances where the formatting is not applied correctly, such as unmatched pairs of asterisks or underscores which could be intended as bold but are not rendered as such by Markdown parsers.\n\n5. **Contextual Formatting**: In some cases, asterisks or underscores might be used in contexts that do not relate to text formatting (e.g., in URLs, code blocks, or mathematical expressions).
