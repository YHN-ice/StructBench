Parsing a Markdown file to extract bold texts can encounter several challenges and obstacles:\n\n1. **Different syntax for bold:** Markdown can use double asterisks `**text**` or double underscores `__text__` for bold text. The parser should handle both cases.\n2. **Nested elements:** Bold text can have nested elements like italics, links, or inline code. The parser needs to correctly identify the bold text without being confused by nested elements.\n3. **Escaped characters:** Users might escape asterisks or underscores that are not meant to denote bold text, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should recognize escaped characters and not treat them as markup.\n4. **Incomplete markers:** Sometimes, a user might forget to close the bold syntax with corresponding markers, leading to incorrect parsing if not handled adequately.\n5. **Inline vs. multiline:** Bold text can be inline or span across multiple lines. The parser should correctly extract multiline bold text as a single entity.\n6. **Combination with other elements:** Bold syntax might be used in combination with other Markdown elements like headings, lists, or blockquotes. The parser should isolate the bold text from these elements.\n7. **Literal asterisks or underscores:** Asterisks or underscores that appear in code blocks or quoted blocks should not be interpreted as bold markers.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts from a given markdown file, the parser must be designed to handle these potential issues and still extract the raw text that is meant to be displayed as bold."
