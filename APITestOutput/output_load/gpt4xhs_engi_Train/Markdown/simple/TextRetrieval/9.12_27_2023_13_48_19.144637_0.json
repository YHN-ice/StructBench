The parser must be able to handle both variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can have nested formatting, such as italic or strikethrough. The parser must recognize the bold syntax even when it is within other formatting markers.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the bold markers might be escaped with a backslash to display as literal asterisks or underscores instead of creating bold text. The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: There may be instances where the closing markers for bold text are missing or mismatched. The parser must decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser will need to correctly identify and extract the text even if there are line breaks.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Markdown syntax for links and images may contain asterisks or underscores, which could be confused with the bold syntax. The parser should correctly ignore these false positives.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks and inline code should not be parsed as formatted text since they are meant to represent code literally.\n\n8. **Complex Combinations**: Users may combine bold with other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, and headers in complex ways that could complicate extraction.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, the parser must navigate these potential issues and accurately interpret the Markdown syntax."
