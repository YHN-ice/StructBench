For example, images can be linked with or without a title attribute, and the alt text can be empty or contain spaces and special characters.\n\n2. **Inline vs Reference Images**: Markdown allows for both inline image embedding and reference-style links. An inline image embedding directly includes the URL, while a reference-style link will refer to a URL defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be either relative to the document or absolute URLs to an external resource. Handling the extraction correctly might necessitate different approaches depending on the path type.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: In some cases, characters like parentheses and brackets might be escaped within the Markdown, which can complicate parsing.\n\n5. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes links and images can be formatted similarly in Markdown, with the key difference being an exclamation mark before the opening bracket for images. Ensuring that we're extracting image file names and not just links is important.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: There may be nested elements within the alt text of an image or complex Markdown structures that make parsing more complicated.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Various flavors of Markdown might have extensions that introduce non-standard ways to include images.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Text that looks like an image link but isn't intended to be one can be a source of false positives. This could be due to incorrectly formatted Markdown or intentional examples within the text.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, a robust Markdown parsing script or tool would need to account for these variations and edge cases to accurately identify and extract all image file names."
