However, variations or errors in syntax might exist, such as missing the exclamation mark, alt text, title, or parts of the URL.\n\n2. **Images embedded from URLs versus local files**: An image in Markdown can be linked from an external source via a URL or included from a local file path. We need to differentiate between these and determine if you only need local file names or all image links.\n\n3. **Relative versus absolute paths**: Local image paths can be relative to the Markdown file or absolute paths. Handling these correctly will be important.\n\n4. **Reference-style image links**: Markdown also supports reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image tag but is instead defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Non-standard Markdown extensions**: Some Markdown processors support their own syntax extensions which may include different ways to embed images. \n\n6. **Escaped characters**: Image syntax could include escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n7. **Markdown within code blocks**: Image syntax within code blocks should not be considered as actual images, as these are meant for display as code, not for rendering images.\n\n8. **Link definitions spread across multiple lines**: Sometimes link definitions can be spread across multiple lines, which can make regex parsing tricky.\n\n9. **Complex filenames**: Filenames can include spaces, special characters, or have no extension, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\nPlease provide the input file, and I will attempt to parse it to extract the image file names."
