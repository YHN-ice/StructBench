I would need to differentiate between them and ensure I extract only the file names, not the entire paths.\n\n3. **Reference-style image links**: Markdown allows for images to be included using reference-style links, where the URL is not inline but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Complex image paths**: The image file paths might include directories or query parameters which could complicate the extraction of just the file name.\n\n5. **Image links in code blocks or inline code**: Images inside code blocks or inline code (backticks) should not be treated as actual images because they are meant to represent code.\n\n6. **Alt text variations**: The alt text for images can have various characters, including parentheses, which could potentially confuse a simple parser that does not account for balanced pairs of parentheses.\n\n7. **Markdown variations and extensions**: There are different flavors of Markdown, and some might have special ways of including images that do not conform to the standard Markdown image syntax.\n\n8. **Escaped characters**: Some characters in the Markdown might be escaped, and the parser needs to handle those correctly to not mistake them for markup.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, additional logic would be necessary to accurately extract just the filenames of the included image files in a Markdown document."
