Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract bold texts from a Markdown file:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Syntaxes for Bold:** Markdown supports multiple ways to make text bold. The most common methods are using double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__`. A parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis:** Text can be bold and italic at the same time, which is typically marked by triple asterisks `***` or a combination of double asterisks and underscores. The parser must distinguish between different levels of emphasis.\n\n3. **Inline Code Blocks:** Bold syntax within inline code blocks (enclosed by backticks `) should not be interpreted as bold since they are meant to display literally. The parser has to ignore markdown formatting within inline code blocks.\n\n4. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks:** Just like inline code blocks, code blocks (indented with four spaces or a tab) and fenced code blocks (enclosed by triple backticks ``` or tildes ~~~) should not have their content parsed for markdown formatting.\n\n5. **Escaped Bold Characters:** Users can escape markdown formatting characters with a backslash (\\). For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be parsed as bold. The parser must recognize and ignore escaped formatting.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting:** Sometimes markdown syntax may not be correctly closed, such as `**bold without end`. Depending on the parser's strictness, this might be interpreted as bold or ignored.\n\n7. **Links and Images:** Bold syntax within link texts or image alt texts might need special handling because the syntax for links and images can include brackets and parentheses which might conflict with bold formatting.\n\n8. **Line Breaks:** In some markdown implementations, line breaks may interfere with formatting. Bold text that spans across lines or paragraphs might be an issue.\n\n9. **Overlapping Formats:** There could be overlapping formatting where a bold section starts but then an italic section starts before the bold one ends, leading to potentially ambiguous markdown.\n\n10. **Performance:** If the markdown file is large, performance considerations may come into play when designing the parser algorithm.\n\nIt's important for the parser to correctly handle these scenarios to ensure accurate extraction of bold texts from the markdown file."
