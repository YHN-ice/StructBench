It's necessary to handle both cases.\n\n3. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes, links and images can be formatted similarly (especially in reference-style links), so it's crucial to distinguish between them:\n   - Image: `![Alt text][image-id]`\n   - Link: `[Link text][link-id]`\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Images can also be included using a reference-style approach where the link is defined elsewhere in the document:\n   - `![Alt text][image-id]`\n   - Later in the document: `[image-id]: /path/to/img.jpg \"Optional title\"`\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that might be part of the Markdown syntax may be escaped, and this should be taken into account for accurate parsing.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown**: Images may be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes, which could complicate parsing.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Not all images end with traditional file extensions (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.), so the parser must account for various image formats.\n\n8. **Incorrect Formatting**: User errors in the document might lead to incorrectly formatted Markdown that still displays images in some viewers but doesn't follow the specifications strictly.\n\n9. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is very large, it may be necessary to implement an efficient parsing strategy to avoid performance bottlenecks.\n\n10. **Encoding and Decoding**: Special characters within image paths or titles may be URL-encoded or contain Unicode characters, which need correct handling.\n\nIn order to extract the filenames accurately, the parser should be robust against these variations and potential formatting inconsistencies."
