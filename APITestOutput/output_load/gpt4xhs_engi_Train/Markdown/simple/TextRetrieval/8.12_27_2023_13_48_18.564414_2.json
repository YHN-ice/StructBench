Both styles might be used in a file, requiring different parsing strategies.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in a Markdown file can be linked using either relative paths or absolute URLs. It's important to distinguish between them and handle each case accordingly.\n\n3. **Complex URLs**: Image URLs might contain query parameters or fragments which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Nested Markdown Elements**: An image link could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might affect the regex or parsing logic.\n\n5. **Alternative Text Challenges**: The alternative text for an image (`alt text`) might contain brackets, parentheses, or other characters that could be mistaken for part of the Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Reference Style Links**: For images using reference-style links, the actual URL is provided elsewhere in the document. The parser must match the reference to its definition to extract the correct URL.\n\n7. **Non-Standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown files might use extensions or non-standard syntax for embedding images which could cause issues with standard parsing logic.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax might be escaped within an image's alternative text or URL, and thus the parser needs to correctly interpret them.\n\n9. **Incorrect Syntax**: Sometimes, images are not properly formatted in Markdown. The parser may need to either correct these errors or identify and ignore them.\n\n10. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: If multiple images are included on a single line, the parser needs to correctly identify and extract each individual image file name.\n\n11. **Hidden Images**: Images that are commented out in the Markdown should typically not be extracted unless specifically required.\n\n12. **File Names with Spaces or Special Characters**: File names might contain spaces or special characters that need to be handled correctly during extraction.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help in creating a robust parser that can accurately extract image file names from a Markdown document."
