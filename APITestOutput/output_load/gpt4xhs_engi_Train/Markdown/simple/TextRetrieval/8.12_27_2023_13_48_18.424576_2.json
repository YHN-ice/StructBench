The parser needs to handle these and potentially more variations.\n\n2. **Embedded HTML Tags**: Some Markdown files use HTML tags to embed images instead of standard Markdown syntax. The parser will have to recognize these tags and extract the image URLs from them.\n\n3. **Reference-style Image Links**: Markdown permits reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but instead referenced at another place in the document.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There might be non-image file links or URLs that could be mistaken for image files if only a naive search for links is performed.\n\n5. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths could be relative to the document or absolute URLs, and the parser should consider both.\n\n6. **Image Links with Parameters**: Sometimes image URLs contain extra parameters for sizing or other options, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **Formatting and Escaping**: The image link might be broken across lines, or special characters could be escaped, which may require careful parsing to properly extract the filename.\n\n8. **Text Inside Image Tags**: There could be additional text inside the image tags, such as titles or JavaScript events, which are irrelevant for the filename extraction but need to be handled by the parser.\n\nEach of these obstacles would require a specific solution or handling to ensure accurate extraction of image file names from the Markdown content."
