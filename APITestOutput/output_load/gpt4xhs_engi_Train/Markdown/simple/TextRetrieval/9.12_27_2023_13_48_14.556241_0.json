Typically, double asterisks `**text**` or double underscores `__text__` are used to denote bold text. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might have nested elements like italicized words, links, or inline code blocks. The parser must extract the bold text while correctly handling or ignoring the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\_not bold\\_`), which means they should not be treated as formatting characters. The parser must recognize and properly handle escaped characters.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There could be instances where double asterisks or underscores are used in the text not for bold formatting (e.g., in code blocks, URLs, or as part of regular text). The parser needs to distinguish between actual formatting and false positives.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting**: There may be errors or inconsistencies in the Markdown file where the bold syntax is not properly closed (e.g., `**bold`), or it spans across multiple paragraphs without proper closure.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to be able to capture the entire content as long as it's within the bold formatting delimiters.\n\n7. **Links and Images**: Text inside links or alt text for images might also use bold formatting, adding complexity to the extraction process.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser must implement a robust Markdown parsing algorithm or use regular expressions carefully crafted to match only valid bold syntax while accounting for the above potential difficulties."
