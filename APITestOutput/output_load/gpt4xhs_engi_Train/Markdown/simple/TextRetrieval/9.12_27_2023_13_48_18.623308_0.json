It will be necessary to accommodate all these variations.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis:** Bold text can have nested elements like italic or strikethrough. Properly extracting just the bold text without including any nested formatting tags could be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Bold text markers might be escaped within the Markdown, meaning they are meant to be displayed as literal asterisks or underscores rather than formatting (e.g., `\\**text\\**`). Such cases should not be considered as bold text.\n\n4. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented with four spaces) and inline code (surrounded by single backticks `) should not be considered for formatting. Bold syntax within these elements isn't meant to be parsed as bold.\n\n5. **Links and Images:** Bold text within links or image alt text might need special handling to ensure that the link or image markup isn't disrupted.\n\n6. **Partial Matches:** Incomplete bold syntax (e.g., `**text`) should not be considered as bold text since it's not properly closed.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text:** Bold text might span multiple lines, and proper parsing would need to concatenate these lines.\n\n8. **False Positives:** There might be instances where asterisks or underscores are used in the document for purposes other than bolding text (e.g., bullet lists, horizontal rules), which could lead to false positives if not handled correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser will need a robust method to accurately identify and extract the bold text while avoiding false positives and properly handling all valid Markdown syntax variations for bold formatting."
