Some potential difficulties and obstacles include:\n\n1. **Variation in Syntax**: Markdown uses `**` or `__` to denote bold text. We must account for both forms of syntax to ensure we capture all bold text.\n   \n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Markdown allows for nested emphasis, such as bold within italic or vice versa. Parsing nested structures can be more complex.\n\n3. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, in plain text, the markers for bold text might not be paired properly (e.g., `**bold`). This can happen due to typos or editing errors.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: If a bold marker appears inside an inline code block (denoted by backticks `), it should not be treated as bold since text within code blocks is not subject to markdown formatting.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Markdown allows escaping of special characters using the backslash (`\\`). An escaped bold marker should not be treated as indicating bold text.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Bold markers within the text of links or alt text of images should be handled correctly.\n\n7. **Newlines and Spaces**: Newlines and excessive spaces can cause issues in parsing if not handled correctly, especially if the bold markers are split across lines.\n\n8. **Literal Asterisks**: In some cases, asterisks might be used literally rather than as markdown formatting (e.g., in mathematical contexts). Distinguishing these can be tricky.\n\nIt would be essential to design the parser to handle these potential issues to ensure that all and only the intended bold texts are correctly extracted from the Markdown file."
