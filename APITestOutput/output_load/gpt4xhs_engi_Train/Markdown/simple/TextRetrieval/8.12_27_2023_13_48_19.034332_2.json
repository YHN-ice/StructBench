Here are some potential obstacles that we might encounter:\n\n1. **Different Image Syntaxes**: Markdown supports embedding images using an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for the alt text and parentheses for the image URL (`![alt text](image-url)`). However, users can also embed images using HTML tags (`<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"alt text\">`), which would require a different parsing approach.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: The image file paths could be either relative (e.g., `./images/picture.jpg`) or absolute (e.g., `https://example.com/image.png`). We would need to extract just the file names in both cases.\n\n3. **Variations in URL schemes**: Images may be hosted on `http` or `https` protocols, or they might even be encoded directly into the Markdown using data URIs.\n\n4. **Markdown Link References**: Sometimes, Markdown includes links as references, which means the actual URL could be elsewhere in the document, not directly next to the image syntax.\n\n5. **Incorrect Formatting**: If the Markdown file has any incorrectly formatted image syntax, it could either be missed by the parser or incorrectly recognized as something else.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, characters within the Markdown could be escaped (e.g., `!\\[image](image-url)`), making it appear as though there is an image when in fact it is just text.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images can also be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or block quotes, so the parser must handle these structures correctly.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There may be multiple images on a single line, which requires that the parser correctly identifies each individual image.\n\nEach of these potential obstacles would require specific logic in the parsing process to ensure that all image file names are correctly extracted and listed."
