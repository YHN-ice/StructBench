The most common is `![Alt text](URL)`, but variations may exist, and the parser must handle each case.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links can be absolute URLs or relative paths. The parser should discern between web URLs and file paths.\n\n3. **Linked Images**: Sometimes images are linked to a URL, which means the image syntax is nested within a link syntax. Extracting the image in this case requires careful parsing to avoid confusion with the link's URL.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style image linking, where the URL is not inline with the image tag but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Non-image Links**: The parser should not mistake non-image file links for image links. For example, links to `.pdf` or `.docx` should not be considered as image files.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Markdown uses backslashes to escape special characters. The parser must handle cases where the image syntax may include escaped characters.\n\n7. **Alt Text Variability**: The alt text for images might include various characters, including parentheses, which could confuse a simple parsing algorithm if it's not context-aware.\n\n8. **Markdown Variants**: There are different Markdown flavors (like GitHub Flavored Markdown), and they might have slight variations in syntax. The parser should be designed with the specific Markdown variant in mind.\n\n9. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain HTML tags. If images are embedded using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax, the parser must be able to handle HTML parsing as well.\n\n10. **Code Blocks**: Image-like syntax inside code blocks should not be considered as actual images since they’re part of code snippets and not meant to display images in the document.\n\nA robust Markdown file parser will need to account for these potential obstacles to accurately extract all included image files."
