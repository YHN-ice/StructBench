The most common one is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there might be variations or additions, such as reference-style links, which can complicate extraction.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Image Paths**: An image source might be a relative path (`./images/picture.jpg`), an absolute path (`/images/picture.jpg`), or a full URL (`http://example.com/images/picture.jpg`). We need to handle each case to extract the file name correctly.\n\n3. **Image References in Text**: The Markdown file could have URLs or file paths in the text that aren't actual image links (e.g., inside code blocks or inline code backticks). We need to be careful not to mistake these for image links.\n\n4. **Handling Different File Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg`, etc.), so we should be prepared to recognize and extract a variety of extensions.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters and Formatting**: Markdown files can include escaped characters or additional formatting that might be present near the image syntax, which needs to be accounted for during extraction.\n\n6. **Linked Images**: Sometimes, images are linked to a URL, so the syntax involves both a link and an image (`[![Alt text](image.jpg)](http://example.com)`). Both the image file name and the wrapping link need to be handled.\n\nNow, please provide the Markdown file content so I can proceed with extracting the image file names."
