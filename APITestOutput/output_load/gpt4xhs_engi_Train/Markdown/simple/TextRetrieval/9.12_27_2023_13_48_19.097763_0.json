The parser must be able to recognize all variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, like links `[**text**](URL)` or italicized text `*italic **bold** italic*`. The parser needs to handle nested structures without breaking.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows escaping of special characters. For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be treated as bold. The parser must differentiate between escaped and unescaped formatting sequences.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There may be sequences of asterisks or underscores that do not constitute bold formatting, such as in code blocks, inline code, or when used for bullet points. The parser needs to ignore these contexts.\n\n5. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes the text might have unmatched markers like `**bold` or `bold**` without the corresponding pair, which can cause confusion about whether to consider it as bold text.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown supports bold text that spans multiple lines. The parser should be able to handle multiline sequences properly.\n\n7. **Different Platforms**: Different Markdown parsers or platforms might have slightly different rules for parsing Markdown, which can affect how bold text is recognized and extracted.\n\n8. **Performance**: Depending on the size of the Markdown file and the complexity of its content, performance can be an issue, especially if the file is very large and contains numerous formatting elements.\n\nConsidering these challenges, the parser must be carefully designed to accurately recognize and extract bold text from a given Markdown file."
