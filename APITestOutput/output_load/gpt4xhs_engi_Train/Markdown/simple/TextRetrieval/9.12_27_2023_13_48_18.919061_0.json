Both of these need to be recognized and handled.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting inside it, such as italics, code, or links. The parser must be able to handle nested formatting without confusing it with the bold syntax.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape Markdown formatting characters using backslashes (\\). Thus, the parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There may be instances where asterisks or underscores are used in a context that is not for bold formatting (e.g., in a mathematical context or within code blocks), and the parser should not mistakenly interpret these as bold text.\n\n5. **Incomplete Pairs**: The parser might encounter unpaired or incorrect usage of syntax (e.g., only one asterisk at the beginning or end), which should not be considered as bold text.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to correctly identify and extract such instances without breaking them apart.\n\n7. **Performance**: If the Markdown document is particularly large with a lot of formatting, the parser should be efficient enough to handle the task without significant performance issues.\n\nThe parser must account for these potential issues while extracting bold text to ensure accurate results.
