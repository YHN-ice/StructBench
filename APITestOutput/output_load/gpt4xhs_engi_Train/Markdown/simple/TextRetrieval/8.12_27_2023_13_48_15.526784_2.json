The standard syntax for embedding an image is as follows:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](URL_to_image \"Optional title\")\n```\n\nWith this in mind, some potential difficulties and obstacles might include:\n\n1. **Variations in syntax**: Some Markdown files may use variations of the standard syntax, such as omitting the alt text or title, using different quotation marks, or including additional attributes.\n2. **Image URLs vs. file names**: The image source could be a URL to an external site or a relative path to a file within a repository or local directory. It's essential to differentiate between these and only extract file names if that's what's requested.\n3. **Reference-style image links**: Markdown also supports reference-style links, where the URL is not included inline but defined elsewhere in the document. For example:\n   ```markdown\n   ![Alt text][id]\n   ...\n   [id]: URL_to_image \"Optional title\"\n   ```\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can contain raw HTML, and images can be embedded using the `<img>` tag instead of Markdown syntax.\n5. **False positives**: Text that looks like an image link but isn't used as one (e.g., examples or documentation about Markdown syntax within the file) could be mistakenly identified as an actual image link.\n\nTo give an accurate answer, I would need to parse the Markdown file with these considerations in mind and extract the relevant portions of text that represent image file names in the context of how they are used within the file."
