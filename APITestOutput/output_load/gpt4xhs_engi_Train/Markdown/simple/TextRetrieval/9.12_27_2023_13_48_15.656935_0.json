The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italics, strikethrough, or links. For instance, `**_bold and italic_**`. The parser must correctly extract the bold text without including the other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are used to indicate bold formatting (like asterisks or underscores) might be escaped with a backslash to display them as literals rather than formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should not consider these as bold texts.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: There might be instances where the bold markers are not correctly paired, such as `**bold text`. This could lead to incorrect extraction if not properly handled.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) or inline code (indicated by single backticks `) should not be parsed for formatting. Thus, bold markers within code blocks should be ignored.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser should be able to handle this case without breaking the extracted text at the line breaks.\n\n7. **Overlapping Formats**: There might be overlapping formatting where bold and other formats begin and end within each other. The parser should be able to disentangle these correctly.\n\n8. **False Positives**: There can be false positives, where asterisks or underscores are used in the text but not with the intention of creating bold formatting.\n\n9. **Ambiguity with List Markers**: In Markdown, asterisks are also used for list items. The parser should differentiate between list item markers and bold markers.\n\nAfter considering these difficulties, I'll need to see the input file to provide an accurate answer to extracting all bold texts."
