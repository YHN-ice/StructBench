The most common are `**text**` and `__text__`. We need to ensure we recognize all valid syntaxes for bold text.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold markup can be found within a line of text rather than on its own line. The parser has to be able to identify bold text within a paragraph or alongside other elements (like italics, code blocks, links, etc.).\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: If the asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), that text is not considered bold. The parser needs to be aware of escapes.\n\n4. **Nested Elements**: Sometimes, bold text can include other elements like italics (`*` or `_`), code (` `` `), or even other bold markers. The parser must handle nested formatting correctly.\n\n5. **Incorrectly Paired Markers**: Users might mistakenly use uneven numbers of asterisks or underscores (e.g., `**bold*` or `__bold_`). The parser must decide how to handle these cases—whether to ignore them or try to interpret them as bold text anyway.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Although less common, bold text could span multiple lines. The parser should decide whether to support multiline bold text and how to handle line breaks within bold sections.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are also used for other purposes (such as list items or horizontal rules), so the parser must distinguish between these uses and actual bold text.\n\n8. **Performance**: If dealing with a very large Markdown document, the parser's performance and efficiency become important factors to consider.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we should proceed carefully and make sure our approach accounts for the nuances of Markdown parsing."
