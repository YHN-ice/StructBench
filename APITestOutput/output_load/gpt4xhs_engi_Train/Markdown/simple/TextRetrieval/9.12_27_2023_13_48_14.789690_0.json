Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Variation in Syntax**: Markdown has multiple ways to indicate bold text, such as using double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser must handle all variations.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain nested elements like links `[**bold link**](url)`, code spans `` **`code`** ``, or other formatting. The parser needs to correctly extract the bold text without including the syntax of nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores could be escaped to display literally, as in `\\**not bold\\**` or `\\__not bold\\__`. The parser should not interpret these as bold text.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Text that looks like bold formatting but isn't part of the Markdown syntax (e.g., a paragraph that accidentally includes a double asterisk) should not be extracted.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be instances where the bold syntax is not correctly closed, such as `**bold text`. The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n6. **Context Sensitivity**: The parser needs to be aware of the context. For example, text within code blocks should not be parsed for formatting, as formatting is ignored in code blocks.\n\n7. **Performance and Scalability**: If the Markdown file is exceptionally large, the parser's performance could be an issue.\n\n8. **Platform-Specific Extensions**: Different platforms extend Markdown with their own syntax (e.g., GitHub-Flavored Markdown). The parser might need to support these extensions.\n\nTo address these difficulties, the parser must implement a robust algorithm for identifying bold text, handling edge cases, and accurately extracting and returning the desired content."
