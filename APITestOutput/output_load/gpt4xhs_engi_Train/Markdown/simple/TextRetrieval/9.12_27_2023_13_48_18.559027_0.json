We would need to account for both.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold syntax could be nested within other formatting elements like italics, lists, or headers. We should ensure that bold extraction works within these contexts.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores may be escaped within the document to display them literally rather than as formatting, which means they should not be treated as bold markers.\n\n4. **Partial formatting**: In some cases, users might mistakenly only apply bold formatting to a part of the word or phrase. Deciding how strictly to interpret these as bold can be a challenge.\n\n5. **Inline code blocks and code fences**: Bold formatting is not applicable within inline code (surrounded by backticks) or fenced code blocks (surrounded by triple backticks or tildes). We need to ignore these sections when parsing for bold text.\n\n6. **Links and images**: The text inside links (in square brackets) and images (preceded by an exclamation mark) could also be in bold. We would need to ensure that we correctly parse these instances.\n\n7. **Overlapping formatting**: There might be overlapping formatting where bold intersects with other styles like strikethrough or highlights. These need to be carefully extracted as well.\n\nOnce we understand the input file and its contents, we can determine which of these potential difficulties are relevant and then proceed to extract the bold texts accordingly."
