The parser must handle all cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may include other formatting like italics, code, or even links. The parser must be able to discern the bold text from the surrounding elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores may be escaped with a backslash to display them as literals rather than formatting. The parser needs to correctly interpret escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Syntax**: There might be instances where the syntax for bold formatting is not correctly closed, leading to ambiguity in identifying bold text.\n\n5. **Inline vs. Block-Level Elements**: Bold text can appear both inline within a paragraph and within larger block-level elements like headers or list items. The parser needs to handle both scenarios.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text could span multiple lines, and ensuring that the entire bold section is captured requires the parser to manage multiline patterns.\n\n7. **Adjacent Formatting**: Bold syntax can appear adjacent to other formatting markers without any space, and the parser must differentiate between these elements.\n\n8. **Markdown Flavors and Extensions**: There are different flavors of Markdown (like CommonMark, GFM - GitHub Flavored Markdown), and some might have additional rules or extensions for formatting text which could complicate parsing.\n\nTo ensure accurate extraction, the parser has to consider these potential difficulties and handle them accordingly."
