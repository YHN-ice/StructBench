We need to handle all possible syntaxes.\n\n2. **Variety of URL formats**: Images might be linked using relative paths, absolute URLs, or even base64 encoded data. Only file paths or URLs should be considered, not data URIs.\n\n3. **Alt text confusion**: It's possible to misinterpret alt text containing parentheses or brackets as part of the URL or file path, so we must accurately distinguish between alt text and the image link.\n\n4. **Reference-style links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but is instead referenced elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be nested inside other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might add complexity to the parsing process.\n\n6. **Escape characters**: File names might include characters that are escaped in Markdown, which would require unescaping to get the correct file name.\n\n7. **Incomplete or malformed syntax**: If the Markdown is not well-formed (e.g., missing closing parentheses or brackets), it might be challenging to extract the image filenames correctly.\n\n8. **File name extraction**: After identifying the image syntax, we need to correctly parse and extract just the file name, excluding the surrounding syntax and alt text.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser will need to be robust and account for various Markdown formatting possibilities when extracting image file names."
