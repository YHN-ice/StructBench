Different Markdown syntaxes for bold: Markdown allows for text to be made bold using double asterisks `**text**` or double underscores `__text__`. This means the parser must recognize both patterns.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text may also contain other formatting, such as italics, code, links, or strikethroughs. It will be essential to ensure that only the bold portion is extracted and other formatting is not included.\n\n3. Incomplete or incorrect Markdown: Users sometimes make mistakes when writing Markdown, such as missing an asterisk or an underscore. A robust parser should be able to handle minor inconsistencies.\n\n4. Ambiguity with bullet points: In Markdown, asterisks are also used for bullet points. The parser must distinguish between the asterisk used for bullet points and for bold text.\n\n5. Multi-line bold text: Markdown can sometimes support bold text spread across multiple lines. The parser should be able to recognize and handle multi-line bold formatting.\n\n6. Escaped characters: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash in order to display them literally rather than as formatting. The parser should not interpret escaped characters as formatting.\n\n7. Special cases: There might be other special cases or non-standard extensions of Markdown that could affect how bold is represented, which would need to be taken into account.\n\nOnce presented with the input file, the parser should carefully analyze the content to appropriately address these challenges and extract just the raw bold text."
