The most common syntax is `![alt text](image_url \"title\")`, but there could be variations or shortcuts used in different Markdown flavors.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: In some cases, images might be included using raw HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax, e.g., `<img src=\"image_url\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"title\">`.\n\n3. **Reference-style links**: Images might be included using reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: URLs for image files may be URL-encoded or contain query parameters, which may require decoding or parsing to extract the plain file name.\n\n5. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links could be relative to the document location or absolute URLs. Extracting just the file name from an absolute URL may require additional processing.\n\n6. **Embedded data images**: Some Markdown documents may use base64-encoded images embedded directly within the document, which do not have typical file names but rather a data URI scheme.\n\n7. **File extensions**: Image files can have various extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and some files might not have a clear extension, making it difficult to identify them as images without inspecting the content type.\n\n8. **Text resembling image syntax**: There may be instances where a text segment looks like an image link but isn't, such as code blocks or escaped characters that are part of the document's content.\n\n9. **Comments and ignored sections**: Parts of the Markdown document might be comments or sections that should be ignored when parsing, such as comments in HTML blocks.\n\n10. **Complexity of the document**: Depending on the complexity and size of the Markdown document, parsing and extracting information efficiently can be challenging.\n\nWith these potential difficulties in mind, it's important to have a robust and flexible parsing strategy to handle various cases and ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
