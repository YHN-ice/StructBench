The most common are double asterisks `**text**` or double underscores `__text__`. We should ensure that the parser recognizes both methods.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might have nested formatting, such as italic, strikethrough, or inline code. For example, `**this _is_ bold**`. The parser needs to identify and extract the bold text while handling or ignoring the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes asterisks or underscores may be escaped with a backslash to indicate that they should not be treated as formatting characters, like `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting:** There might be occurrences where the bold syntax is not correctly closed, such as `**bold text`, which could confuse the parser. Deciding how to handle these cases is important.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Text:** Bold text might span multiple lines, which might be a challenge if the parser is designed to read line by line.\n\n6. **Links and Images:** Links and images may also contain asterisks or underscores, so the parser needs to distinguish between these and actual bold formatting.\n\nRecognizing and accounting for these potential issues will be crucial in accurately extracting bold text from the Markdown file."
