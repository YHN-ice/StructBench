I need to be prepared to handle different syntaxes.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths:** Image links might be given as relative or absolute paths, and it can be challenging to identify them if the context isn't clear.\n\n3. **Embedded Base64 images:** Sometimes images are embedded directly in the Markdown using Base64 encoding. These need to be identified differently as they don't have traditional file names.\n\n4. **Linked vs. embedded images:** Images might not be directly embedded but linked to external sources. I should only extract file names and not URLs.\n\n5. **Image references:** Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. **Non-image files:** We should be careful not to extract non-image files that might also be included in the Markdown, such as `.pdf` or `.docx`.\n\n7. **Markdown inside HTML:** Markdown can be included inside HTML tags, which could affect how image links are parsed.\n\n8. **Escaped characters:** Some image filenames may include escaped characters which will need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n9. **Incorrect Markdown:** If the Markdown is incorrectly formatted, it may pose challenges in accurately parsing image file names.\n\n10. **File extension variety:** Images might have a variety of file extensions, like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., and the parser needs to recognize all possible image file types.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll attempt to account for these challenges and extract the image filenames accordingly."
