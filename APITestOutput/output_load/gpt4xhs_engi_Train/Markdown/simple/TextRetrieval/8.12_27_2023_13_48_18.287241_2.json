You must recognize and handle all possible syntax variations.\n\n2. **Inline HTML Image Tags**: Some Markdown files also include inline HTML tags, such as `<img src=\"image.png\" />`. The parser should be ready to extract image file names from these tags as well.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be given in both relative and absolute terms. When extracting file names, the parser must correctly identify the file name irrespective of the path provided.\n\n4. **Image Links with Parameters**: Sometimes image links might contain additional parameters (like `![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg?size=50%25)`), which need to be stripped away to extract the pure file name.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown Constructs**: The image syntax might be nested within other Markdown constructs like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: If special characters in the Markdown are escaped (like `!\\[Alt text\\](/path/to/img.jpg)`), they need to be identified as not part of an actual image link.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Text that looks like image syntax but isn't actually (like code blocks containing example Markdown syntax) should not be mistaken for actual images.\n\nRecognizing and addressing these challenges will be essential for correctly parsing the Markdown file and extracting all included image files."
