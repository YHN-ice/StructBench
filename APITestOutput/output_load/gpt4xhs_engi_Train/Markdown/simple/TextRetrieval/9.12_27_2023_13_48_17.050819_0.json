It's necessary to recognize and handle all of them correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might have nested formatting such as italic, strikethrough, or code blocks within it. Care must be taken to extract only the bold portion without any formatting that is not bold.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Characters used for bold formatting might be escaped with a backslash to display them literally, e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`. These should not be mistaken for actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting:** Sometimes, the formatting can be incomplete or incorrect, like `**bold`, which may not be intended to be bold text. Decisions need to be made about how to handle such cases.\n\n5. **Links and Images:** Links and images might contain asterisks or underscores that shouldn't be confused with bold formatting.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks (indented by 4 spaces or surrounded by triple backticks) or inline code (surrounded by single backticks) should not be parsed for formatting, including bold.\n\n7. **Line Breaks:** Bold text might span multiple lines, which requires handling line breaks appropriately within the bold text.\n\n8. **Contextual Bold:** Sometimes bold text is used in headers or other contexts where the parsing rules might differ slightly.\n\nRecognizing and handling these potential issues is crucial to accurately parse the Markdown file and extract all bold texts correctly."
