The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations and shorthand syntax might also be used.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in Markdown can be referenced using both relative and absolute paths. Extracting the file name might require different handling for each type.\n\n3. **Embedded URLs and Base64 Encoded Images**: Sometimes, images are not referenced via a file name but are included directly as a URL or as Base64 encoded strings. This might not be considered as 'included image files' but could potentially confuse the parser.\n\n4. **Links Masquerading as Images**: There might be links that are formatted similarly to images (e.g., `![This is a link](http://example.com)` or `<img src=\"...\" />`), which could be incorrectly identified as images if the parsing isn't careful.\n\n5. **HTML Image Tags**: Markdown files may also include raw HTML, so `<img>` tags with `src` attributes might also be present and should be considered.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Some image references might include escape characters that need to be handled correctly to extract the actual file name.\n\n7. **Markdown inside HTML**: If Markdown is used inside HTML tags, it may not be parsed as Markdown. This could affect the extraction of image references within those HTML blocks.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges, we can now proceed to parse the Markdown file and extract the image file names while being mindful of these potential obstacles. Please provide the Markdown content that we need to parse."
