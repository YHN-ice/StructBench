Extracting just the bold text without these nested elements can be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores may be escaped with backslashes which means they are not formatting characters. We need to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Pairs**: There might be instances where the asterisks or underscores are not properly paired, which makes it difficult to determine if the text should be considered bold.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines. A parser must handle the line breaks correctly within the bold text.\n\n6. **Ambiguity with Other Formatting**: There might be confusion between bold and italic if the user has placed an odd number of asterisks or underscores.\n\n7. **Handling Code Blocks**: Text inside inline code (single backtick) or code blocks (triple backticks) should not be parsed as formatted text.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, we need the input Markdown file, and I will need to correctly handle these potential issues to parse the bold texts."
