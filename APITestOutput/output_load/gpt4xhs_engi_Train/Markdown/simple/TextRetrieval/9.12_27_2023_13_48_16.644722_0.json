In Markdown, bold text is usually indicated by surrounding the text with either two asterisks `**` or two underscores `__` on each side. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract bold texts:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: Markdown supports multiple ways to format text as bold. Some users might use double asterisks (`**bold text**`), while others might prefer double underscores (`__bold text__`). A parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested inside other Markdown formatting elements, such as links (`[link](url)`), code blocks (`), or italicized text (`*italic*` or `_italic_`). Extracting bold text correctly requires parsing the Markdown to understand the hierarchy of elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape Markdown formatting characters with a backslash (`\\`), like `\\**not bold\\**`, which should not be interpreted as bold.\n\n4. **Incorrect Syntax**: Sometimes users make mistakes and do not correctly close the bold syntax, which can lead to parsing errors or incorrect extractions, like `**bold text`.\n\n5. **Inline Code Blocks**: Bold syntax inside inline code blocks (e.g., ``These are not **bold**``) should not be interpreted as bold since everything within code blocks is treated as literal text.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text that spans multiple lines may present a challenge as some parsers are line-based and may not recognize multiline formatting.\n\n7. **Complex Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions that add more complex syntax, which could conflict with standard bold text parsing.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is very large, it may cause performance issues when parsing through the entire document to find bold texts.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust Markdown parser needs to correctly implement the parsing logic that understands the Markdown syntax and its edge cases and can accurately extract the content marked as bold while ignoring false positives."
