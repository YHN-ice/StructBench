An image could be included using an `<img>` tag instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Links Masquerading as Images**: Sometimes, links might be formatted similarly to images but are not intended to display an image. For example, `[text](URL)` is a link, whereas `![alt text](URL)` is an image.\n\n5. **Reference Links**: In cases of reference-style images, the actual URL of the image might be placed elsewhere in the document, so finding and matching the reference to its URL might be needed.\n\n6. **Complex URLs**: The URLs might include complex characters or query parameters that are not part of the actual file name but are included in the URL.\n\n7. **Markdown Flavors**: Various flavors of Markdown (GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.) may have slight differences in how they handle images. \n\n8. **Comments or Non-standard Use**: Sometimes, image syntax might be commented out or used in non-standard ways, such as inside code blocks where it shouldn't be treated as an actual image.\n\nIn order to correctly parse the Markdown file and extract all included image files, one would need to account for these potential issues and parse the content accordingly."
