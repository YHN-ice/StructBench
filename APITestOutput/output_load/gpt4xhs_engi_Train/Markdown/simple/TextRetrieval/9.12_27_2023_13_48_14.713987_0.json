I need to ensure that the parser recognizes both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements such as links, images, or even inline code. I have to decide whether to extract just the text or include the nested elements as part of the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the bold syntax to display literal asterisks or underscores (`\\**not bold\\**`). The parser has to distinguish between actual bold syntax and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Sometimes, users might make formatting errors like mismatched or uneven asterisks or underscores (`**bold*`, `__bold_`). The parser may need to handle or ignore these inconsistencies.\n\n5. **False Positives**: There could be instances where double asterisks or underscores are used in the text not to indicate bolding but for other purposes, such as in mathematical contexts or when mentioning keyboard shortcuts.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser will have to handle line breaks within the bold text correctly.\n\n7. **Overlapping Syntax**: Bold syntax might overlap with italic syntax if users combine them (e.g., `***bold and italic***`). The parser has to correctly identify and extract the bold part of the text.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown document is large, efficiently parsing the document without causing performance issues could be a challenge.\n\nAfter considering these challenges, I'm ready to see the input file and attempt to extract the bold texts."
