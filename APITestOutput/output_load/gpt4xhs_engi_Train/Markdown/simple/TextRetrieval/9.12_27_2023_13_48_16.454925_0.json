While parsing a Markdown file to extract bold texts, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could be encountered:\n\n1. **Markup Variations:** Markdown has different ways to denote bold text. The two most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` and double underscores `__bold text__`. Ensuring both are accounted for during parsing is important.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold text may have other elements nested inside it, such as links, images, or even inline code. Extracting just the bold text while properly handling or excluding the nested content could be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Users might escape the asterisks or underscores to avoid creating bold text, like `\\**not bold\\**`. Handling escaped characters correctly is necessary to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Line Breaks:** Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser should correctly identify and extract such instances without breaking at line ends.\n\n5. **Mixed Formatting:** A piece of text might have mixed formatting, such as bold and italics together, e.g., `**_bold and italic_**`. The parser would need to differentiate and extract just the bold part if required.\n\n6. **Incomplete Markup:** Sometimes, the Markdown text might contain mistakes, like an unpaired asterisk `*bold**`. Deciding how to handle incorrect or incomplete markup can affect the results.\n\n7. **Context-Sensitive Parsing:** Depending on the context (e.g., within a list, blockquote, or code block), the interpretation of `**` might change, and bold text shouldn't be extracted from code blocks where `**` is meant to be taken literally.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, the parser must handle all these situations effectively. Now, let's proceed with viewing and parsing the Markdown content to extract the bold texts. Please provide the Markdown file or its content so that I can assist you further."
