Here are some challenges and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract bold texts from a Markdown file:\n\n1. **Multiple Formats**: Markdown syntax allows for multiple ways to denote bold text. The most common are `**text**` and `__text__`. A parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can contain other Markdown elements like links (`[link text](URL)`), italics (`*text*` or `_text_`), or code spans (`` `code` ``). These nested elements could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the bold syntax (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which should not be treated as bold text. The parser should recognize and handle escaped characters correctly.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are used for other purposes as well, such as in bullet lists. The parser should avoid false positives by distinguishing between these use cases and actual bold syntax.\n\n5. **Incomplete Syntax**: Sometimes the Markdown might have syntax errors, like unmatched asterisks or underscores (e.g., `**bold`). Deciding how to handle these cases can be tricky.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Line breaks in Markdown files could split bold syntax across lines, and a parser might need to handle multi-line bold text.\n\n7. **Code Blocks**: Text inside code blocks (indented by 4 spaces or surrounded by `` ``` ``) should not be parsed as bold text, even if it contains bold syntax.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a robust Markdown file parser will need to have well-defined rules and error handling mechanisms to extract bold text accurately. Now let's proceed with the input file to identify and extract the bold texts as requested."
