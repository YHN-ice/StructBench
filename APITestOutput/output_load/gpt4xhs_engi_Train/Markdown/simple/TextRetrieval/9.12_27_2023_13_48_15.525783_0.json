This requires careful handling to extract just the bold text without the nested formats.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are meant to be displayed literally rather than as formatting, such as `\\**not bold\\**`, should not be considered bold text.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There could be non-standard usages that look like bold formatting but are not, such as when asterisks are used in a different context (e.g., in a bullet list or in a code block).\n\n5. **Incomplete Pairs**: Sometimes, the opening or closing formatting marks might not be paired correctly (e.g., `**bold text`), which could be a mistake in the document, or it could be intentional for some other effect.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, so we would need to consider multi-line patterns if applicable.\n\n7. **Ambiguous Formatting**: Text that is surrounded by more than two asterisks or underscores might be intended as bold, or it could be extra emphasis (bold and italic), requiring interpretation based on context.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, these potential difficulties will inform the approach I take to accurately extract all bold texts."
