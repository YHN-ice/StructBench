For example, images can be included using the `![Alt text](URL)` syntax or reference-style links like `![Alt text][id]` where `id` is defined elsewhere in the document. I'll need to handle all the variations.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be included with both relative and absolute paths. If relative paths are used, it's important to know the base path to fully resolve them, although for the purpose of just extracting filenames, full resolution isn't strictly necessary.\n\n3. **Complex URLs**: Some image URLs might include complex paths or query parameters which need to be handled correctly.\n\n4. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes URLs or paths might be enclosed in angle brackets or followed by specifications of title attributes in quotes. These additional elements should not be confused with the actual URL.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: If the Markdown contains escaped characters that are part of Markdown syntax, such as a backslash preceding an exclamation mark or brackets, these need to be handled so they are not misinterpreted as image syntax.\n\n6. **Non-Image Files**: URLs could point to non-image files, and without looking at the content type or file extension, it might be easy to mistakenly include them if they're formatted similarly to image links.\n\n7. **Multiline Definitions**: In some Markdown variants, the definition of a reference-style image link could be split over multiple lines, which might complicate parsing with simple line-based approaches.\n\n8. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown can also include raw HTML, so there may be `<img>` tags embedded within the Markdown text which could contain image references.\n\n9. **Encoded URLs**: URLs within the Markdown can be URL encoded and might need decoding to extract the correct filename.\n\nTo ensure I accurately extract all the image file names, I'll need to have a robust pattern matching system that can handle these complexities and maybe others that weren't anticipated here."
