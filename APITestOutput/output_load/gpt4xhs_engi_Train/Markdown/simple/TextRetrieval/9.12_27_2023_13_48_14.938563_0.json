We need to account for both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold text may have other formatting elements nested inside it, such as italicized text, inline code, or links. Extracting just the bold text may require ignoring or separately handling these nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Asterisks or underscores might be escaped with backslashes in the Markdown content, and these should not be mistaken for formatting markers.\n\n4. **False Positives:** Asterisks and underscores can also be used in contexts that aren't related to formatting, such as bullet points or in code blocks. These should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n5. **Spanning Multiple Lines:** Bold text might span across multiple lines, which could complicate the extraction depending on how the parser handles line breaks.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:** There might be edge cases where the formatting is incorrect or unconventional, which could lead to incorrect extraction if not handled properly.\n\nTo address these challenges, we would need to implement or use a Markdown parser that can differentiate between these scenarios and accurately extract only the intended bold text segments."
