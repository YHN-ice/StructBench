This requires parsing HTML within the Markdown.\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute URLs**: Image URLs can be either relative to the location of the Markdown file or absolute URLs pointing to an external resource. Only the file names of images with relative URLs should typically be extracted.\n5. **URL Encoding**: Image file names in URLs might be URL-encoded, so decoding might be necessary to get the correct file name.\n6. **Markdown Links vs Image Embeds**: Distinguishing between links and images can be tricky as both use similar syntax with only an exclamation mark differentiating them.\n\nGiven these challenges, to accurately extract all included image files, one would need to parse the Markdown content, identify all image embedding patterns, resolve reference-style links if any, handle inline HTML if present, and extract the file names ensuring they are properly decoded if they are URL encoded."
