A parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold syntax can be nested within other elements like links `[**bold text**](URL)` or italicized text `*italic and **bold** text*`. Extracting the bold text without including other formatting can be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Asterisks or underscores that are meant to be displayed as literal characters rather than formatting can be escaped with a backslash `\\`, as in `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to recognize and ignore escaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Syntax:** Sometimes, a bold syntax might not be properly closed, such as `**bold text`. Depending on the specification, such cases may or may not be considered as bold text by different parsers.\n\n5. **Text across multiple lines:** Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines, which means the parser must be able to handle multiline bold text correctly.\n\n6. **False Positives:** Other uses of asterisks or underscores (such as in bullet points, horizontal rules, or just within normal text) should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n7. **Contextual Formatting:** The meaning of asterisks or underscores can change depending on their context (for example, within code blocks or inline code formatting where they should not be interpreted as bold).\n\nBefore proceeding with the extraction task, it's important to be aware of these potential issues and ensure that the parser is designed to address them appropriately."
