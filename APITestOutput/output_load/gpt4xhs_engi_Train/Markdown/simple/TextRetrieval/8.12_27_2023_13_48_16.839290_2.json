This might be complicated by:\n    - Query parameters or fragments in URLs (e.g., `![Example](image.png?size=50#fragment)`)\n    - Using relative or absolute paths (e.g., `![Example](/path/to/image.png)` vs. `![Example](http://example.com/image.png)`).\n    - File names that contain spaces or special characters that are often URL-encoded.\n\n3. **Distinct Image Files**: We have to ensure that each image file name is unique and not repeated due to reuse in the Markdown.\n\n4. **Non-Image Files**: Ensuring that the links we extract are indeed images and not links to other types of files or web pages.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Handling any incorrect Markdown syntax that may erroneously include what looks like an image but isn't.\n\n6. **Markdown Variants**: Different flavors of Markdown might have slightly different rules or extensions for embedding images.\n\nOnce we start parsing the input file, we will need to carefully apply pattern matching or string manipulation to address these potential challenges and accurately extract the image file names."
