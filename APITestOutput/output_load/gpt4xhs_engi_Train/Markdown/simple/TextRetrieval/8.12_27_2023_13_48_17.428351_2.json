The typical syntax for an image in Markdown is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract image file names:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Flavors**: Markdown has different flavors like GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) or CommonMark which might have subtle differences in how images are embedded.\n  \n2. **Variations in Image Syntax**: Some Markdown files might use reference-style image embedding instead of inline, or they might omit certain elements like the alt text or title.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. Extracting the file name from an absolute URL might be more complex than handling a relative file path.\n\n4. **Linked Images vs Embedded Images**: Some images might be linked to rather than embedded directly, which could be mistaken for an embedded image if the extraction is based solely on URL patterns.\n\n5. **Non-Standard Syntax**: Sometimes users don't follow the standard Markdown syntax, or they might have typos in their Markdown, leading to improperly formatted image lines that are harder to parse accurately.\n\n6. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include HTML tags for more complex image embedding, which can complicate parsing if we're expecting only Markdown syntax.\n\n7. **Encoded URLs**: URLs for images might be URL-encoded, which means special characters are encoded and might not resemble typical file paths or names.\n\n8. **File Extensions**: Not all images will necessarily have standard image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif), and some might be scripts or services providing dynamically generated images without clear file names.\n\nFor the most accurate extraction, the parser must handle these potential variations and complexities effectively."
