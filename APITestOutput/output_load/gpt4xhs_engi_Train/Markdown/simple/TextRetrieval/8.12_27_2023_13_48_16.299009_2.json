For example, reference-style links might be used instead of inline links.\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image files could be linked using relative or absolute paths, and correctly identifying these might be necessary.\n3. **Embedded URLs**: Images can also be linked to external URLs instead of files within a project or file system, so distinguishing between URLs and file names might be needed.\n4. **Special Characters**: File names may contain special characters that need to be handled correctly.\n5. **HTML Tags**: Markdown files can also include HTML tags, so there might be image tags (`<img src=\"...\">`) that should be considered.\n6. **Link References**: Markdown allows for link references where the actual URL is placed elsewhere in the document. This could complicate the extraction process.\n7. **False Positives**: Text inside square brackets followed by parentheses might not always indicate an image link. So, context matters.\n8. **Title Attribute**: The optional title attribute could contain parentheses which might confuse simple parsing logic.\n\nFor an accurate extraction, these challenges would need to be addressed by the parser logic used to identify and extract the image file names."
