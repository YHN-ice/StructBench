The parser must handle both correctly.\n\n3. **Reference-style image links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the alt text but rather defined elsewhere in the document. This requires the parser to identify and resolve these references.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs or paths**: Some URLs or paths might be URL-encoded or include special characters that need to be decoded or handled properly.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, image tags might be embedded directly as HTML within the Markdown file (`<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"Optional title\" />`). The parser would need to be able to recognize and extract these as well.\n\n6. **Non-image file links**: There might be links to non-image files or other resources that should be ignored when extracting image file names.\n\n7. **Image titles and alt text**: The parser should not confuse the optional title or alt text of an image with the file name.\n\n8. **Distractors**: There might be text that looks like an image link but isn't, such as code blocks that contain example Markdown syntax.\n\nTo address these issues, the parser will need to be robust, with rules to accurately identify and extract only the paths or URLs of image files from the Markdown content it is given."
