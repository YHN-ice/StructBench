We need to account for both.\n\n2. **Complex image URLs:** Some image URLs might be complex, including parameters or fragment identifiers, which need to be parsed correctly to ensure the whole URL is captured.\n\n3. **Non-image links:** The parser should distinguish between image links and other types of links to avoid extracting non-image file names.\n\n4. **Image titles and alt text:** Images in Markdown can include optional alt text and titles, which might use similar syntax to the image URL itself. The parser needs to differentiate these from the actual image file names.\n\n5. **Relative vs. absolute paths:** Image sources might be given as relative paths or full URLs.
