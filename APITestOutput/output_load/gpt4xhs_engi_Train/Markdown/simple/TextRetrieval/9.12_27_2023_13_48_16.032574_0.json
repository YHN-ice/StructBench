Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Multiple Syntaxes**: Markdown allows for bold text using double asterisks `**bold**` or double underscores `__bold__`. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags, such as italics, code blocks, or strikethroughs. The parser should correctly identify bold text within such nesting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores can be escaped with backslashes to indicate that they are not meant for formatting (e.g., `**bold \\*\\***`, which should still be interpreted as bold text without the escaped asterisks).\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: Users may mistakenly use incorrect syntax, such as mismatched or uneven asterisks or underscores (e.g., `**bold*`, `**bold__`). These are not valid markdown for bold text but could be present in the input.\n\n5. **Inline Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Text within inline code (using backticks `) or fenced code blocks (using triple backticks ```) should not be considered for formatting.\n\n6. **Link Descriptions**: Bold syntax within a link description `[**bold**](url)` should be correctly extracted, but this can complicate parsing since links have their own syntax.\n\n7. **Text Separation**: Extracting bold texts will involve ensuring that they are separated appropriately, as requested, without additional markdown formatting.\n\n8. **List Items and Blockquotes**: Bold text might appear within list items or blockquotes, which may affect how the text should be extracted if the extraction needs to consider the context.\n\n9. **Line Breaks and Paragraphs**: Bold text might span multiple lines or paragraphs, so the parser needs to handle line breaks and paragraph separation appropriately.\n\n10. **Performance and Scalability**: For very large Markdown files, there may be performance considerations when parsing for bold text throughout the entire document.\n\nIdentifying and handling these potential issues will be important for accurately parsing the Markdown file and extracting all bold texts as raw text separated by line breaks."
