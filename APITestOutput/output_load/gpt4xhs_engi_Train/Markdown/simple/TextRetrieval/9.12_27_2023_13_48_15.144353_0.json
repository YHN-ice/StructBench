The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. Parsing needs to account for both.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text can be nested within other Markdown elements, like links `[**bold text**](URL)` or italicized text `*italic and **bold** text*`. The parser must be able to handle nested emphasis without confusion.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash in order to display them literally (e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`), which means they should not be treated as bold.\n\n4. **Incorrect Pairs of Delimiters**: A common issue is that the delimiters for bold might not be correctly paired (e.g., `**bold text*`), which could cause parsing errors.\n\n5. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (enclosed by backticks `) should not be parsed for Markdown formatting, including bold.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Similar to inline code blocks, code blocks (indented by four spaces or a tab) and fenced code blocks (surrounded by triple backticks or triple tildes) also should not have their content parsed for Markdown formatting.\n\n7. **Complex Combinations**: Real-world Markdown documents can include complex combinations of all of the above, which can make parsing quite challenging.\n\n8. **Multiple Bold Sections on Same Line**: There might be multiple bold sections within a single line, and the parser has to extract all of them separately.\n\n9. **Line Breaks within Bold Sections**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which requires the parser to treat such cases as a continuous bold section.\n\nTo correctly parse and extract all bold texts from a Markdown file, a parser must take these factors into account and implement logic to handle them correctly."
