This would require the parser to understand HTML `<img>` tags as well.\n\n4. **Linked Images**: An image can also be linked from another place within the document, which means the URL for the image is not directly beneath the image syntax but referenced from elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: If the image syntax includes escaped characters, such as a backslash before a parenthesis, it could complicate the parsing process.\n\n6. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown variants or extensions might have additional or different ways to embed images.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: The parser may need to handle errors or unexpected input gracefully, identifying when something is not an image link even though it may appear similar to one at first glance.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, a robust parsing solution would need to account for these and potentially other edge cases in order to reliably extract all image filenames from a given Markdown file."
