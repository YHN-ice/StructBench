I'll need to identify and extract just the filenames when they are provided with relative paths.\n\n3. **Links Masquerading as Images**: Sometimes links are formatted in a way that they appear similar to images, e.g., `[Link text](URL)`. It is important not to confuse these with actual image markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain HTML tags, including `<img>` tags for embedding images. These may need to be recognized and processed differently.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs or Spaces in Filenames**: URLs for images might be percent-encoded, or filenames could contain spaces which are replaced by `%20` or other characters in Markdown.\n\n6. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be more than one image on a single line, so it's important to ensure that all image references are extracted, not just the first one on a line.\n\n7. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also supports reference-style images where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document. This requires matching the reference to its definition.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties, I'll need to carefully parse the input Markdown file to extract all image file names correctly.
