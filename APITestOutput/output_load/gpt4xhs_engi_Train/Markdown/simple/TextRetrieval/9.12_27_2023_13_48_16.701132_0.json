Different Markdown syntax for bold: Bold text in Markdown can be created using different syntaxes, such as double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__). It's important to recognize both as they represent bold text.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text may have other formatting inside it, like italics or code. Depending on the ask, I may need to either strip out the nested formatting and only return the bolded text or include the nested formatting in the returned text.\n\n3. Inline bold text: Bold text can be in the middle of a sentence, which means the parser must be able to handle inline formatting without mistakenly capturing non-bold text.\n\n4. Escaped characters: If the asterisks or underscores used for bold formatting are escaped (preceded by a backslash), they should not be treated as formatting characters.\n\n5. False positives: Characters that resemble formatting markers but are not used for formatting (e.g., in code blocks or inline code) should not be mistakenly identified as bold.\n\n6. Incomplete syntax: If the Markdown contains errors, such as an unclosed bold syntax (missing ending asterisks/underscores), it may lead to incorrect extraction, either by failing to recognize bold text or by capturing too much text.\n\n7. Multi-line bold text: Markdown sometimes allows for bold text that spans multiple lines, and it's essential that the parser recognizes such instances correctly.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties requires a careful approach to parsing the Markdown file to ensure accurate extraction of all bold texts."
