Different Markdown image syntax: Markdown allows for images to be included using the `![]()` syntax. However, there could be variations, such as reference-style images or images with additional attributes like titles.\n   \n2. Inline HTML: Sometimes, images are embedded using HTML tags like `<img src=\"image.png\" />` within the Markdown file. These would need to be handled separately from the standard Markdown syntax.\n   \n3. False positives: There could be text that looks like an image tag but isn't, such as commented-out images, or image tags within code blocks or inline code segments, which should not be treated as images.\n   \n4. Image links spread across multiple lines: An image tag could be split across multiple lines, which makes regex-based parsing trickier.\n\n5. Link definitions elsewhere in the document: In reference-style linking, the actual URL of the image might be located far from the image reference itself, which makes extraction more complicated.\n\n6. The presence of escape characters: Characters like backslashes that escape special Markdown characters could affect how the parser identifies valid image syntax.\n\n7. Relative vs absolute paths: Image sources could be provided as relative paths or full URLs. Both should be correctly identified.\n\n8.
