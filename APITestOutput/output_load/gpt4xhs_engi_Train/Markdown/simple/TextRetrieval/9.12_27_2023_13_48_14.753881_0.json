Different Markdown Flavors: Markdown has various flavors (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and each may have slightly different syntax for bold text. We need to know which flavor we're working with to parse it correctly.\n\n2. Bold Syntax Variations: In Markdown, bold text can be denoted in different ways, such as `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`. The parser needs to handle all variations.\n\n3. Nested Formatting: Bold text might contain other formatting inside it, like links, italicized text, or code spans. The parser must be able to identify the bold text without getting confused by nested formatting.\n\n4. Escaped Characters: Sometimes asterisks or underscores may be escaped within the Markdown, implying that they should not be treated as formatting characters. The parser must distinguish between escaped and unescaped characters.\n\n5. Partial Formatting: There might be situations where the asterisks or underscores are not correctly paired, leading to partial formatting. The parser should decide how to handle these cases.\n\n6. Code Blocks and Inline Code: Bold syntax within code blocks and inline code should not be treated as formatted text, so the parser must ignore bold markers within those.\n\n7. Context of Bold Text: Bold text may appear within headers, lists, blockquotes, and other Markdown constructs. The parser should be able to extract bold text irrespective of its context.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties, I will need to see the specific input file to address the task of extracting all bold texts accurately."
