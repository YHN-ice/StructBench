For instance, text can be made bold using double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. I need to account for these different methods.\n\n2. **Nested Formats**: Bold text could be nested within other formatting like italics, hyperlinks, or code blocks. For example, `**bold _italic_**` or `[**bold link**](URL)`. Extracting just the bold part while considering the context might be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks and underscores used as literal characters rather than formatting, which are escaped with a backslash like `\\**not bold**` or `\\__not bold__`, need to be identified and handled appropriately.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: There may be instances where the bold syntax is not complete due to typos or errors, such as `**bold text*` or `*bold text**`. These should not be considered as bold text.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text inside code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented with four spaces) and inline code (surrounded by backticks `) should not be processed for formatting, as they are meant to display raw text.\n\n6. **False Positives**: Parts of the text might look like bold markers but are not, such as in URLs, mathematical expressions, or when asterisks or underscores are part of the normal text flow.\n\n7. **Overlap with Other Formatting**: Bold text may overlap with other formatting like strikethroughs, for example, `~~**bold and strike**~~`, which may create complexity in parsing the text correctly.\n\n8. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text could span multiple lines, and ensuring such scenarios are handled correctly could be complex if the parser is designed to work on a line-by-line basis.\n\n9. **Performance Issues**: If the input markdown file is large, it might take considerable time and resources to parse the file and extract all bold texts accurately.\n\n10. **Platform-Specific Variations**: Different Markdown processors might have slight variations in how they handle bold formatting, which could affect the parsing logic.\n\n11. **Unicode and Emojis**: Bold formatting around Unicode characters and emojis might need"
