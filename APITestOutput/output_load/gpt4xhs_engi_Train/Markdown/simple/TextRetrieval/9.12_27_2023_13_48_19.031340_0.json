Both need to be accounted for.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting inside it, such as italics, code spans, or links. It's important to extract only the text that is bold, without other nested formatting.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash, which means they are not meant to make the text bold but should appear as literal characters.\n\n5. **Inline vs. Block Elements**: Bold text can occur within a paragraph (inline) or as part of other block elements. Care must be taken to recognize bold within different contexts.\n\n6. **False Positives**: Text that appears to have bold markers might not be bold if the syntax is not correct (e.g., missing a closing marker).\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text**: Sometimes bold text might span across multiple lines, which can be tricky to detect and extract correctly.\n\n8. **Link Descriptions**: The link description part in Markdown syntax could also use bold markers, which should be correctly identified as part of the link and not as standalone bold text.\n\nTo successfully extract the bold text, the parser must handle these cases effectively. Now I'm ready to see the input file and begin extracting the bold texts."
