The parser must be capable of recognizing all the common patterns.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Sometimes images can be embedded using HTML tags directly within the Markdown file. This means the parser also needs to recognize `<img>` tags.\n\n3. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images may be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which can complicate pattern recognition.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image links could be either relative to the document or absolute URLs. Extracting only file names might require additional processing to distinguish between a URL and a file path.\n\n5. **Links vs Images**: Links and images have similar syntax in Markdown (`[link text](url)` vs `![alt text](image-url)`). The parser must differentiate between these and not mistakenly extract links as image files.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: The presence of escape characters might make it difficult to accurately identify the proper syntax for image embedding.\n\n7. **Text that Looks Like Markdown Syntax**: There might be text in the document that is not actual Markdown syntax but has the appearance of it, which could lead to false positives.\n\n8. **Multiple Image References**: There might be multiple references to the same image file that need to be deduplicated.\n\nTo handle these situations, a robust parsing algorithm must be employed that can accurately identify and extract image file names, taking into account all these potential complications."
