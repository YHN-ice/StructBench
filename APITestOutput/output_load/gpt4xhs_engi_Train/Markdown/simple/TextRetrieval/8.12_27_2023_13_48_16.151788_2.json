The parser needs to recognize all the possible image syntaxes.\n\n2. **Image References**: Markdown also allows for reference-style image inclusions, where the image reference and URL are defined separately. This could be in the form of `![Alt text][image-ref]` followed by `[image-ref]: URL`, which might be located elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using inline HTML tags like `<img src=\"URL\" alt=\"Alt text\" />`. The parser must be able to identify these as well.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There may be instances where the image syntax is used within a code block or inline code snippets, which should not be treated as actual images. The parser needs to ignore these cases.\n\n5. **URLs with Parameters**: Sometimes image URLs might have additional parameters or fragments which need to be accounted for when extracting the file name.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: The parser must recognize various image file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.) to accurately extract the image file names.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Special characters may be escaped within Markdown, and the parser needs to handle these scenarios correctly when extracting image names.\n\n8. **Complex File Paths**: File paths might include directories, special characters, or spaces, and they might be relative or absolute paths. The parser will need to properly handle these variations to extract just the file names.\n\nOnce you provide the input Markdown file, I'll attempt to address these challenges and extract all included image file names.\n"
