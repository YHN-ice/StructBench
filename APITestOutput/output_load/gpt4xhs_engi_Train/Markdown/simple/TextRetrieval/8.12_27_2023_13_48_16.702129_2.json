Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Variations in Markdown image syntax**: Markdown allows for images to be included using different syntax variations, such as `![alt text](image_path)` for inline images or reference-style images with a separate reference definition. Identifying all these variations can be challenging.\n\n2. **Complex file paths**: Image file paths can be complex, including relative paths (`./images/pic.jpg`), absolute paths (`/images/pic.jpg`), URLs (`http://example.com/pic.jpg`), or even containing spaces and special characters that might be encoded.\n\n3. **Link vs. Image**: Distinguishing between link syntax and image syntax in Markdown can be tricky as they are similar. Links are formatted as `[text](URL)` and images as `![alt text](image_path)`. Ensuring that only image file names are extracted without confusing them with links is important.\n\n4. **Image files within HTML tags**: Sometimes, images are embedded using HTML tags within a Markdown file, such as `<img src=\"image_path\" />`. These cases require parsing HTML within Markdown.\n\n5. **Alt text variations**: The alt text of an image can contain various characters, including parentheses and brackets, which might confuse a simple parser looking for patterns.\n\n6. **Non-standard Markdown extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions that add non-standard syntax for embedding images, which could differ from the basic Markdown image syntax.\n\n7. **Embedded data images**: Markdown may include embedded images using data URIs, where the image data is base64 encoded directly in the document rather than linking to a file.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a robust parser would need to carefully consider these cases to accurately extract all included image files from a Markdown document."
