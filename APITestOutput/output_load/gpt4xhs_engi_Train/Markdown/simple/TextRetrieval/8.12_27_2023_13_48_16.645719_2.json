The parser needs to recognize all possible syntax variations for images.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style image insertion where the URL is not inline but rather defined elsewhere in the document. This means the parser needs to find and associate the reference with the correct URL.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image sources can be given as relative paths or absolute URLs. Depending on what is needed, the parser may need to differentiate between them or convert relative paths based on the context or base path.\n\n4. **Image Links**: Sometimes images are also links, so the parser needs to extract the image file without considering the link as part of the file name.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be nested within other Markdown elements such as lists, blockquotes, or tables. The parser must correctly navigate the Markdown structure.\n\n6. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown dialects include non-standard extensions that may affect how images are included (e.g., size specifications, classes, etc.). The parser needs to handle these gracefully.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: The parser should be able to handle escaped characters that might be present in image filenames or alt text.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Sometimes text might look like an image syntax but isn't (comments, code blocks, etc.). Avoiding false positives is important.\n\n9. **Content Inside Alt Text**: The alt text inside the image syntax might contain brackets `[]` or parentheses `()` which could confuse a simple parsing algorithm.\n\n10. **Unfinished Syntax**: Incomplete or incorrect image syntax should be handled properly, whether by ignoring it or signaling an error.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, the parser needs to be robust against these potential complications. Once the input file is provided, we can look for these cases and extract the image file names accordingly."
