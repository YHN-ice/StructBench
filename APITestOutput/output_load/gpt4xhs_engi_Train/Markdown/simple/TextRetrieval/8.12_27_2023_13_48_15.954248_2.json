A parser must handle these cases as well.\n\n4. **Link References**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Filenames or URLs might include escaped characters that need to be unescaped to get the correct path.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images could be nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes, which might complicate parsing if the parser is not context-aware.\n\n7. **Non-Standard Markdown Extensions**: There are several flavors of Markdown that introduce non-standard ways to include images, such as directives or shortcodes specific to particular Markdown engines.\n\n8. **Comments and Metadata**: Sometimes, images or their paths could be commented out or included in metadata sections that are meant for processing by static site generators and not for direct display.\n\nTo extract all image file names successfully, a parser must correctly identify and handle these potential issues."
