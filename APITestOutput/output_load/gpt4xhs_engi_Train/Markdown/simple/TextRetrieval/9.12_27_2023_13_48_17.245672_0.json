The parser must handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may be nested within other markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, images `![alt](url)`, or even within other bold or italic text. The parser needs to correctly identify the bold text without being thrown off by the nesting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used as literal characters might be escaped with backslashes, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`, and should not be mistaken for formatting.\n\n4. **Line Breaks**: Markdown doesn't always consider line breaks within a paragraph as the end of a bold formatting sequence. For example, the following is still bold:\n\n   ```\n   **This is\n   bold text**\n   ```\n\n5. **Partial Formatting**: There might be incomplete formatting markers that should not be identified as bold text, such as `**bold __not bold** still not bold__`.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or indents) and inline code (indicated by single backticks `) should not be parsed as formatted text.\n\n7. **Links with Bold Text**: Markdown links can include bold text within their description, which should be extracted, but without the link syntax.\n\n8. **List Items and Headers**: Bold text may appear within list items or headers, which may have their own preceding characters (`-`, `*`, `#`, etc.). These should not interfere with the detection of bold text.\n\n9. **Whitespace Handling**: Extra spaces or tabs around the asterisks or underscores might cause a parser to miss the bold formatting.\n\n10. **Overlapping Formatting**: Situations where italic and bold formatting overlap can be complex to parse, as Markdown allows italic and bold to be combined using combinations of asterisks and underscores.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts from the Markdown, the parser should be able to handle all these cases and any other peculiarities of Markdown syntax."
