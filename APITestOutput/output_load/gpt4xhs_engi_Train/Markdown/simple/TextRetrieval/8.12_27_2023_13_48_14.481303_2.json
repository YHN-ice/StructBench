Handling both types might be necessary.\n   \n3. **Embedded base64 images**: Images can also be embedded directly into Markdown using base64 encoding. Identifying and extracting the filenames (if any) from these would be more challenging.\n   \n4. **Linked images**: Sometimes, images are not embedded but are linked, which means the actual Markdown syntax is pointing to a URL instead of a file that can be extracted.\n\n5. **Non-standard Markdown extensions**: Certain flavors of Markdown might have extensions or plugins that allow for non-standard ways of including images, which could complicate parsing.\n\n6. **HTML tags in Markdown**: Some Markdown files include raw HTML for more complex formatting. Images might be included with `<img>` tags instead of Markdown's image syntax.\n   \n7. **Comments or disabled image links**: Sometimes, image links might be commented out or disabled in some way (e.g., by removing an exclamation mark), which means they should not be considered as included images.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the task would involve carefully scanning the Markdown document, correctly identifying the image syntax, and extracting the file names while navigating these challenges."
