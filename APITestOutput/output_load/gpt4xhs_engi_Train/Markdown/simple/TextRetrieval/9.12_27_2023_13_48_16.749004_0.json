The most common are `**text**` and `__text__`. The parser must handle both styles.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold text can be nested within other elements (like links or italics), which can complicate extraction. We need to ensure that we extract only the bold text and not the surrounding elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes, Markdown allows for escaping the bold syntax to prevent it from being parsed. For example, `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should not consider escaped syntax as bold.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks:** Text within inline code blocks (using backticks) should not be treated as bold, even if it contains `**` or `__` characters.\n\n5. **False Positives:** Sequences of `**` or `__` that don’t actually surround text (like standalone asterisks or underscores used for other purposes) should not be mistakenly identified as bold text.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Texts:** Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines, so the parser must be able to handle multiline patterns.\n\n7. **Overlapping Formatting:** In some cases, formatting may overlap, such as bold within italics or vice versa. The parser should correctly identify and extract just the bold portion.\n\n8. **Performance Concerns:** If the Markdown file is very large, performance could become an issue. Efficient parsing methods will be important to avoid long processing times.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties, we can proceed with extracting the bold texts once we have the input file content."
