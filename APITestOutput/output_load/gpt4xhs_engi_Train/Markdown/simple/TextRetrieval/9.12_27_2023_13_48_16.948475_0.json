Parsing a Markdown file for bold texts may present several challenges, including but not limited to:\n\n1. **Variety of Syntax**: Markdown has more than one way to denote bold text. Typically, text is made bold by surrounding it with double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__`. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might have other formatting elements nested inside it, such as italics, links, or code spans. The parser must be able to extract the bold text without including the syntax of these nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are used in a literal sense and are escaped with a backslash (`\\*`, `\\_`). The parser needs to recognize when these characters are escaped and not treat them as formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: There might be stray or unmatched formatting markers that are not actually meant to create bold text. The parser should properly ignore these.\n\n5. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (denoted with backticks `` ` ``) should not be parsed for formatting, even if it contains what looks like bold syntax.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: In some Markdown flavors, bold text can span multiple lines. The parser must be able to handle multi-line formatting.\n\n7. **Links and Images**: Bold syntax might be part of a link label or an image description, which could complicate extraction if the syntax for links and images is not handled correctly.\n\nAddressing these obstacles effectively will require careful parsing logic that can distinguish between different Markdown formatting permutations and extract the intended bold text while ignoring false positives."
