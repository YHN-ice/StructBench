The parser must recognize all valid forms of bold syntax.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text may contain other nested elements like links (`[link](url)`), inline code (`code`), or italics (`*italics*` or `_italics_`). The parser needs to correctly handle these and still extract the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes bold indicators (like `**` or `__`) might be escaped with a backslash to display them literally, as in `\\**not bold**`. The parser should distinguish between escaped and unescaped markers.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: Users might have incorrectly formatted the bold text which won't render as bold in Markdown. For example, `** bold**` with a space after the initial `**` won't be bold.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown sometimes allows for bold text to span across multiple lines. The parser must be able to handle this scenario.\n\n6. **Adjacent Bold Blocks**: There could be multiple bold texts right next to each other. The parser should be able to differentiate and extract them separately.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, the parser must handle all these scenarios correctly. Now please provide the Markdown file content, so I can begin the extraction process."
