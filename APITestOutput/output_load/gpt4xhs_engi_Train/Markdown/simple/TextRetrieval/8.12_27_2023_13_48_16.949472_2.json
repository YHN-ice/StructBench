It's important to account for both and potentially other variations.\n\n2. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links which separate the URL from the actual place where the image is used. This can make it more difficult to extract the image file name as it might not be in the same line as the `![]`.\n\n3. **Encoded or Complex URLs**: Some image URLs might be encoded (e.g., spaces replaced by `%20`) or have complex structures with query parameters that might not look like typical file names.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths could be relative or absolute, and sometimes just extracting the file name from an absolute path requires parsing the URL correctly.\n\n5. **Inline Styles or Attributes**: When images are included with HTML `<img>` tags, there might be inline styles or other attributes that could make regex or string parsing more challenging.\n\n6. **Linked Images**: Images in markdown can also be wrapped in links, which adds another layer of syntax to parse through.\n\n7. **Non-image Files**: Ensuring that what's being extracted are indeed image files and not links to other types of files or pages.\n\n8. **Markdown Variants**: There are various flavors of Markdown (like GitHub Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and they may have slight differences in how images are included.\n\nTo correctly extract image file names, the parser will have to navigate these potential challenges successfully."
