Deciding whether to include these as \"filenames\" might depend on the specific requirements.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: URLs might contain URL-encoded characters or query parameters which could complicate the extraction of clean filenames.\n\n5. **Markdown inside HTML**: Sometimes Markdown files contain raw HTML for more complex formatting, and images could be embedded within HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Link References**: Markdown allows the use of reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but is instead defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Text that looks like image syntax but is not actually an image (e.g., commented out lines or examples of syntax) could lead to false positives.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on the Same Line**: If there are multiple images on the same line, the parser must correctly identify and separate each one.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parsing logic must be robust enough to handle these variations and edge cases.
