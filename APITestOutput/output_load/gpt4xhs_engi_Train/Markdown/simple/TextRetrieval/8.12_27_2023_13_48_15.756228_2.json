The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`. However, images might also be included using reference-style links or even inline HTML tags.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image URLs can be relative or absolute. Relative URLs might not provide the full path to the file, making it more difficult to extract just the file name if that's what's required.\n\n3. **Complex URLs**: Some image URLs can be complex, containing query parameters or fragments, which would need to be stripped to get the clean file name.\n\n4. **Non-image URLs**: Not all URLs in a Markdown file are necessarily images. Some might be links to web pages or other resources, so we must discern between them.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: URLs might be percent-encoded, especially if they contain spaces or special characters. These would need to be decoded to get the proper file names.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Markdown allows for escape characters to prevent certain characters from being interpreted as Markdown syntax. This can affect how URLs are parsed.\n\n7. **Distraction with Markdown Image Text**: The alternative text of an image (i.e., alt text) or titles might contain parentheses or brackets that could confuse a simple parser if it doesn't account for the proper syntax.\n\nAfter the input file is provided, I will focus on identifying the specific image syntax used and extract the file names accordingly while keeping these potential challenges in mind."
