The most common format is `![Alt text](URL)`, but variations may exist.\n\n2. **Link Confusion**: We need to distinguish between image links and regular hyperlinks since both use similar syntax. For example, a regular link is `[Link text](URL)` and an image is `![Alt text](URL)`.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image sources can be either relative paths or absolute URLs. We need to ensure our extraction handles both cases.\n\n4. **Reference Style Links**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image text but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: There might be escaped characters in the Markdown that could affect how we parse image filenames.\n\n6. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax, which could complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: If images are nested within other elements (like lists or blockquotes), it might make parsing more complex.\n\n8. **Incomplete or Malformed Syntax**: If the Markdown file contains incomplete or malformed image syntax, these cases would need to be identified and handled appropriately.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we'll need to carefully parse it, keeping these potential difficulties in mind to accurately extract all image filenames."
