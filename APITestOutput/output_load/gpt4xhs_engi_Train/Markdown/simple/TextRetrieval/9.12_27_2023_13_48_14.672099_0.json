Some use two asterisks `**` or underscores `__` before and after the text to indicate bold, while others might use different syntax.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text may have other elements nested inside it, like links, italics, or code spans. Properly extracting just the bold text while ignoring or correctly processing the nested elements can be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used in the text could be escaped with a backslash to display them literally, which should not be confused with the bold syntax.\n\n4. **Inline vs Block Elements**: Bold text can appear within a paragraph (inline) or as part of a larger block element like a list item or header. The parser should handle these contexts appropriately.\n\n5. **Incorrect Syntax**: The Markdown file might have errors or incorrect syntax which could lead to improper parsing of bold text.\n\n6. **Adjacent Bold Syntax**: Sometimes, bold syntax can be immediately adjacent to other syntax (like italic), without whitespace separation, which can complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which means the parser needs to correctly detect when the bold formatting starts and ends across line breaks.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts and print them separated by `\\n`, the parser must correctly handle these various scenarios and any idiosyncrasies of the specific Markdown variant in question."
