Extracting image files from a Markdown file can present several challenges:\n\n1. **Variety of Markdown Image Syntaxes**: Markdown supports different ways of embedding images. The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there can be variations, such as including titles, reference-style links, or using HTML tags like `<img>`.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in Markdown can be linked via absolute URLs (e.g., `http://example.com/image.jpg`) or relative paths (e.g., `images/image.jpg`). Handling both types requires different approaches to extract the filenames.\n\n3. **Complex URLs**: Image sources might include complex URLs with query parameters, anchors, or authentication parts that should not be considered part of the filename.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Filenames or URLs might have escaped characters (like spaces replaced by `%20`) that need to be handled correctly.\n\n5. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There could be multiple images on a single line, which requires parsing the line to extract each image separately.\n\n6. **Non-Image Files**: Links to non-image files could be present and should be ignored (e.g., links ending with `.pdf`, `.docx`).\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might affect the parsing.\n\n8. **Incorrect Markdown Syntax**: Some images might not be displayed due to incorrect Markdown syntax, but they still need to be extracted if the task is to find all image file references.\n\nTo accurately extract all included image files, the parser must effectively navigate through these potential challenges."
