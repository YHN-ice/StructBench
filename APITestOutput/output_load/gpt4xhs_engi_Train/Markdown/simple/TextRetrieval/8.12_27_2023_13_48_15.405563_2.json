The most common format is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations or incorrect usages could lead to parsing errors.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be either relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs. Differentiating between these and extract only the filename might be necessary for the task.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain raw HTML. If images are embedded using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax, they need to be accounted for.\n\n4. **Link References**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but rather defined elsewhere in the document. This can complicate extraction as it requires correlating references with their definitions.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: If the image syntax includes escaped characters, the parser needs to properly interpret them to avoid incorrect extraction of filenames.\n\n6. **Non-image Links**: Ensuring that only image links are extracted and not hyperlinks to other types of files or web pages is also important.\n\n7. **Diverse File Extensions**: There are various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and the parser needs to recognize all possible extensions to accurately extract the filenames.\n\n8. **Lines with Multiple Images**: A single line could contain multiple images. The parser needs to be able to handle multiple extractions from a single line.\n\n9. **Captions and Titles**: Some images might include captions or titles that are not part of the filename but could be confused with it during extraction.\n\n10. **Multiline Image References**: In some cases, the image reference might be broken across multiple lines for readability, which could pose a challenge for line-based parsing.\n\nIdentifying and overcoming these issues is essential for accurate Markdown parsing and image filename extraction."
