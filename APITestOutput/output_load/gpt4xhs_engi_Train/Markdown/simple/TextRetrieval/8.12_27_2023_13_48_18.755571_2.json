The most common one is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there could be variations or additional options used, such as title attributes or reference-style links.\n\n2. **Inline vs. Reference-style links**: Images can be embedded directly using an inline link, or by reference, where the actual URL is placed elsewhere in the document with a reference identifier linking to it.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute paths**: Image sources can be given as relative paths or absolute URLs. Both should be captured, but they might be presented differently in the text.\n\n4. **Image links within HTML tags**: Some Markdown files might use HTML tags to embed images (e.g., `<img src=\"image.png\" />`). These would need to be parsed differently from standard Markdown image syntax.\n\n5. **Non-image URLs**: Not all URLs in a Markdown file will necessarily be images. The parser will need to differentiate between image file links and other types of links (e.g., to websites, documents).\n\n6. **Handling different file extensions**: Image files can have various extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg`, and more. The parser should recognize all common image file formats.\n\n7. **Images referenced multiple times**: The same image might be referenced multiple times in the document, so the parser might need to account for duplicates if the goal is to list unique image files.\n\n8. **Escaped characters or unusual formatting**: Sometimes characters in Markdown might be escaped or formatted in unusual ways, which could complicate parsing.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown elements**: Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which could affect how the text is parsed.\n\n10. **Performance considerations**: If the Markdown file is very large, performance considerations might come into play when parsing the text.\n\nTaking these into account, we can proceed cautiously to ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
