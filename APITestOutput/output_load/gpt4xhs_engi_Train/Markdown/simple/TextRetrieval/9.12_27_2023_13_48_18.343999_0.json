Ensuring that the extraction correctly interprets such nesting could be complex.\n4. **False Positives**: Asterisks or underscores might be used in contexts that are not related to bold formatting (e.g., in code blocks, lists, or as bullet points).\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text may span across multiple lines, so the parser needs to handle line continuations properly.\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed with a matching set of asterisks or underscores, leading to incorrect or partial extraction.\n\nTo ensure correct extraction, the parser must effectively handle these cases and any other Markdown-specific formatting issues.
