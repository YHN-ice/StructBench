The parser needs to handle both cases.\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text may contain other Markdown elements like links (`[link text](URL)`), italics, code spans, or even other bold markers. The parser should be able to extract the bold text without including the markdown syntax of nested elements.\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are part of the text and not meant to indicate bold formatting may be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). The parser should recognize and properly handle escaped characters.\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes the markdown might have typos or incomplete markers (e.g., `**bold text` without a closing `**`). Deciding how to handle these cases (ignore, include as is, or attempt to correct) is important.\n5. **Line Breaks**: Markdown processors typically allow for line breaks within bold text, and the parser should be able to handle bold text that spans multiple lines.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, an accurate markdown parser would need to cautiously traverse the text, identify and handle bold markers appropriately, and extract the raw text without any markdown formatting."
