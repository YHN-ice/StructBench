The most common one is `![Alt Text](image_url)`. However, variations could include reference-style images, where the URL is referenced elsewhere in the document.\n\n2. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images could be in different formats like JPG, PNG, GIF, etc. The parser must be prepared to recognize various image extensions.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The image source could be a relative path or an absolute URL. The parser should be able to handle both scenarios.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes images might be embedded using HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax. Proper parsing would require recognizing those instances as well.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown syntax for images may have escaped characters that should not be interpreted as Markdown, such as `!\\[Alt Text](image_url)`.\n\n6. **Distractions**: The document may contain non-image links or syntax that appears similar to image syntax but isn't actually an image link (e.g., links to web pages).\n\n7. **File Path with Spaces or Special Characters**: File paths could include spaces or special characters, which must be correctly parsed to identify the filename.\n\n8. **Images Inside Lists or Blockquotes**: Images can be nested inside other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might complicate parsing regular expressions.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the parser must carefully scan the document to correctly identify and extract all image paths while ignoring non-image-related Markdown syntax and properly handling variations in image inclusion."
