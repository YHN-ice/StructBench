The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. We must be ready to recognize variations and edge cases (e.g., with or without 'Alt text', with or without 'Optional title', differing quotation marks, or unusual spacing).\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: Image links can be complex, including relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs. We must accurately identify the file name within these different path structures.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes images are embedded using HTML `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax. These can be included inline and may have various attributes.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also supports reference-style image linking, where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document. This requires identifying and connecting the reference to its URL.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Text that looks like an image link but isn't (e.g., a link within code blocks, comments, or incorrectly formatted), should not be treated as an actual image file.\n\n6. **Link Definitions Inside Code Blocks or Quotes**: Links defined inside code blocks or quotes should be ignored as Markdown does not render images from these locations.\n\n7. **Non-image Links**: Ensuring that we only capture image files and not other types of links, such as links to web pages or other non-image files.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There might be lines with multiple images, and we need to extract all of them without missing any.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we will need to parse the Markdown content carefully to identify and extract all image filenames accurately."
