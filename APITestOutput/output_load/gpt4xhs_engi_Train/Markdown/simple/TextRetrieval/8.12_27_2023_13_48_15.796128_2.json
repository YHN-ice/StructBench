The most common one is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there could be variations or shortcuts provided by specific Markdown renderers that need special handling.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image links might be given with absolute URLs, relative file paths, or even base64 encoded data. Extracting filenames from relative paths should be straightforward, but absolute URLs or embedded data might not provide an actual 'file name.'\n\n3. **Image References**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the image URL is not inline with the alt text but instead is referenced at another place in the document. Handling this would require parsing the references too.\n\n4. **Link Inside Image Alt Text**: Sometimes, the alt text itself can contain Markdown links, which could add complexity to the parsing process, making it hard to distinguish between the end of the alt text and the start of the image URL.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Image paths might contain escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly to obtain the actual file names.\n\n6. **Markdown Inside HTML**: Images included inside raw HTML blocks within a Markdown file might not follow the standard Markdown image syntax.\n\n7. **Diverse File Extensions**: There are various image file formats (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), so the parser must recognize all potential image file extensions.\n\n8. **Incorrect Syntax**: Some images might be included with syntax errors, causing them not to display as images. Depending on the parsing objective, you might still want to extract those file names.\n\n9. **Text Resembling Image Syntax**: There could be text in the document that coincidentally resembles the image syntax but isn’t meant to be an image. This can lead to false positives.\n\n10. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Sometimes, images are nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which may require more complex parsing logic to extract correctly.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful consideration of the Markdown specification and possibly some assumptions about the most common use cases and formatting standards in the given input file."
