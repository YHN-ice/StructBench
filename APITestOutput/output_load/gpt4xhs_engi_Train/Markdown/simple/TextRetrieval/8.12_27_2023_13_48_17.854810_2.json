The most common one is `![alt text](image_path)`, but variations or incorrect formats could be present, which might complicate extraction.\n\n2. **Relative and absolute paths**: Images can be referenced via absolute URLs (http://example.com/image.jpg) or relative file paths (./images/image.jpg). Handling both cases might be required.\n\n3. **Images defined as reference links**: Images might not be defined inline but rather as reference links, where the image path is defined elsewhere in the document. This would require linking the reference to its definition.\n\n4. **Images in HTML tags**: Sometimes images are embedded using HTML `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Decorators around image syntax**: There might be additional characters or syntax around the image declaration that could confuse a simple parser, such as images within links `[![alt](image)](URL)` or images with title attributes `![alt](image \"title\")`.\n\n6. **Non-image files**: Ensuring that the extracted paths indeed point to image files and not other types of files.\n\n7. **Escape characters**: In some cases, the image syntax could include escape characters that need to be accounted for.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, adding complexity to the extraction process.\n\n9. **Comments or disabled image syntax**: Sometimes, images could be commented out or the syntax could be intentionally disabled which should not be treated as actual images.\n\nTo correctly extract all image file names, the parser must handle these potential issues. Let's proceed with examining the input Markdown file to address the task at hand."
