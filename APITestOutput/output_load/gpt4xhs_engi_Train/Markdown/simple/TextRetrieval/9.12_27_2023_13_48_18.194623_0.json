The text can be surrounded by double asterisks or underscores (e.g., `**bold**` or `__bold__`). A parser must handle both these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might have other elements nested inside it, such as links (`[text](url)`), inline code (`code`), or italic text (`*italic*` or `_italic_`). The parser needs to extract just the bold text, excluding any nested Markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows for escaping special characters with a backslash (\\). If an asterisk or underscore is escaped (e.g., `**bold\\***`), it may not actually denote bold text.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: Sometimes, Markdown may not be perfectly formatted (e.g., missing a closing asterisk or underscore). Deciding how to handle these cases can be challenging.\n\n5. **Inline vs. Block Elements**: Bold text could be within a paragraph (inline) or as part of a larger block element like headers or list items. The parser must recognize bold text in different contexts.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Markdown doesn't treat single line breaks as actual breaks; instead, they create a space between words. However, double line breaks create a new paragraph. The parser should correctly interpret these when extracting bold text.\n\n7. **Ambiguity With Other Elements**: Markdown syntax for bold can be confused with list items or horizontal rules, depending on context (e.g., `**` at the beginning of a line might be a list item).\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser needs to be robust and capable of accurately identifying and extracting bold text while handling different Markdown syntax scenarios."
