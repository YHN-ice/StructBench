They might have different file extensions such as `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.\n\n3. **Alt Text Confusion**: The presence of alt text (the text inside the square brackets) might vary and can sometimes be confused with an image filename.\n\n4. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support additional syntax extensions that could affect image parsing, such as HTML tags or custom tags.\n\n5. **Links vs Images**: Markdown syntax for links is similar to images, and they can be mistaken for one another if not parsed correctly. Links are typically in the format `[Link text](URL)` whereas images include an exclamation mark like `![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)`.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Characters like parentheses or brackets might be escaped within the document, potentially complicating the parsing process.\n\n7. **Nested Elements**: In Markdown, you can have nested elements, such as an image inside a list or a blockquote, which may require a more complex parsing strategy.\n\n8. **Incorrect Formatting**: There might be formatting errors within the Markdown file, such as missing brackets or parentheses that could lead to incorrect parsing of image paths.\n\nFor a robust solution, the parser has to handle all these cases correctly to ensure that it extracts only the intended image file names from the Markdown content."
