There are variations in how the image URLs can be formatted, and some of them might not directly represent file names.\n   \n2. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for images to be included using reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image tag but instead is placed elsewhere in the document with an identifier. This means you would have to match these identifiers with their respective URLs.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative or absolute. When parsing the file names, you should determine whether you want to extract just the file name or include the entire path.\n\n4. **Markdown Links Misinterpreted as Images**: A common mistake can be confusing image syntax with link syntax. While they are similar, images have an exclamation point before the square brackets, and links do not.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files may contain embedded HTML tags, including `<img>` tags that could contain images.\n\n6. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support non-standard syntax extensions which could affect how images are embedded.\n\n7. **Encoded URLs or Special Characters**: Image URLs might contain URL-encoded characters or special characters which need to be correctly interpreted or decoded.\n\n8. **Images Hosted Externally**: Some images may be hosted externally and could be referenced via a URL rather than a direct file reference within the local project or system.\n\nFor these reasons, a robust Markdown file parser must be able to accurately identify and extract image file paths, considering the context and variations in Markdown syntax."
