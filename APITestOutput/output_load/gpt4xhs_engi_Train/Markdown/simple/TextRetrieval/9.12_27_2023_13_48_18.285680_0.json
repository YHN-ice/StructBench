The most common ones are using two asterisks `**bold text**` or two underscores `__bold text__`. We need to ensure we recognize both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might be nested within other elements, like links `[**bold text**](url)`, or other text might be nested within bold, like `**bold *italic* text**`. We need to properly parse these nested elements without losing the bold formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash to display them literally, like `\\**not bold\\**`. We need to correctly interpret escaped characters and not confuse them with formatting.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There could be false positives where asterisks or underscores appear in pairs but are not meant to be formatting, such as in code blocks or inline code, where they should be treated as literal characters.\n\n5. **Incomplete Pairs**: There may be instances where asterisks or underscores are unmatched, which could lead to incorrect parsing if not handled properly.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Sections on One Line**: A line may contain multiple bold sections separated by non-bold text, and we need to extract all of them.\n\n7. **Line Breaks Inside Bold Sections**: There could be line breaks within bold sections, which need to be handled so that the bold text is extracted as one continuous block.\n\nTo successfully extract all bold texts, the parser must be able to handle these situations appropriately."
