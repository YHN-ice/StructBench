I need to be able to recognize both patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can contain other Markdown elements, such as links `[text](url)`, inline code `` `code` ``, or even other bold markers. Need to parse the content correctly without being confused by nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaping Characters**: Sometimes, the bold markers might be escaped with a backslash to display literal asterisks or underscores in the text like `\\**not bold\\**`. I have to distinguish between actual bold markers and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: In some cases, there may be unmatched or incomplete bold markers (e.g., `**bold`), which can lead to incorrect parsing if not handled properly.\n\n5. **Multiline Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines. The parser must be capable of recognizing and correctly extracting bold text that is not confined to a single line.\n\n6. **Line Breaks and Spaces**: Extra spaces or line breaks might exist between the bold markers and the text. The parser should trim unnecessary spaces while maintaining the integrity of the text.\n\n7. **Ambiguity with Italics**: Markdown also uses single asterisks or underscores for italics. The parser must differentiate between single (`*italic*`) and double (`**bold**`) markers.\n\n8. **Literal Blocks or Code Blocks**: Bold markers within code blocks (indented with four spaces or fenced with `````) should not be considered as formatting but instead as plain text.\n\nTo address these challenges, my parsing logic must be robust and flexible enough to account for the different scenarios that can occur in a Markdown document. Once I see the input file, I can apply these considerations to extract all bold texts accurately."
