A parser must handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like links `[**bold text**](URL)`, italic, or strikethrough. The parser needs to ensure it extracts only the bold part correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash to show the literal character rather than formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should not consider these as bold.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks using backticks `` `like this` `` should not be formatted, so bold syntax within them should be ignored.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Just like inline code blocks, multi-line code blocks using indentation or fenced with triple backticks ``` should not have their content formatted.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There may be false positives where asterisks or underscores appear in the text but are not meant to denote bold formatting (e.g., in mathematical expressions or as bullet points).\n\n7. **Partial Formatting**: Sometimes formatting is started but not properly closed, which might lead to partial text being incorrectly recognized as bold.\n\n8. **Multiline Bold**: Bold text that spans multiple lines might pose a challenge since some parsers are line-based and might not handle multiline formatting well.\n\nThese challenges need to be addressed to ensure accurate extraction of bold texts from a Markdown document."
