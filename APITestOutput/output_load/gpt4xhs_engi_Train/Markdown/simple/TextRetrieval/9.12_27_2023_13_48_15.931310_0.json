The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` and double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser must recognize both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might have nested elements like links `[**bold link text**](URL)`, italics `**_bold and italic_**`, or inline code ``**`bold code`**``. The parser needs to handle these without breaking.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are meant to be displayed literally rather than to denote bold text (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`) must be correctly interpreted.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Paired Markers**: If the bold markers are not correctly paired or are used in a non-standard way, it could be challenging to determine which text is meant to be bold.\n\n5. **Inline Text**: Bold markers within a line of text could be used for emphasis, so the parser must properly extract these without including surrounding non-bold text.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Markdown allows for line breaks within bold text. The parser should correctly handle bold text that spans multiple lines.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) or inline code (single backticks `) should not be parsed as bold since markdown formatting doesn't apply within code segments.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser would need to be designed with a robust understanding of the Markdown syntax and should include a series of rules or regular expressions capable of accurately identifying bold text while accounting for the above complexities."
