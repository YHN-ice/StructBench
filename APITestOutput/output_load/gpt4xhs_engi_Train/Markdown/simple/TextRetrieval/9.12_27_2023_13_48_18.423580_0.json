For example, `**bold text**` and `__bold text__` are both valid. The parser needs to handle all variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may contain other formatting, such as *italic*, `code`, or even [links](http://example.com). The parser should be able to extract the bold text while ignoring or properly handling the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the asterisks or underscores might be escaped to show the literal characters, e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`. These should not be confused with actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Strings that contain asterisks or underscores not intended for bold formatting (e.g., in code blocks or inline code) should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n5. **Incomplete Markers**: A string might start with `**` but without a closing `**`, which is not valid bold syntax. The parser must differentiate between valid and invalid uses.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Markdown processors handle line breaks differently. Some may allow a bold sequence to span multiple lines, while others may not. The parser’s behavior should be consistent with the Markdown flavor it is targeting.\n\n7. **Contextual Understanding**: The parser needs to understand the context of the Markdown document. For example, text within HTML tags or within a blockquote might need different handling.\n\nTo extract all bold texts accurately, the parser must address these challenges."
