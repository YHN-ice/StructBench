The parser must recognize all valid Markdown syntax for bold text.\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italics, strikethrough, or hyperlinks. For example, `**bold _italic_**`. The parser would need to correctly identify the bold text while ignoring other formatting.\n3. **Escaped characters**: If the asterisk or underscore characters are escaped with a backslash in Markdown, they shouldn't be treated as formatting markers. For example, `\\**not bold**` should not be interpreted as bold.\n4. **Incorrectly formatted text**: There might be instances where the Markdown syntax is not correctly closed, such as `**bold text`. The parser must decide how to handle these cases—whether to ignore them, partially parse them, or report an error.\n5. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (indented by four spaces or fenced by backticks) or inline code (enclosed by single backticks) should not be parsed for formatting, as these are meant to display literal text.\n\nTo extract all bold texts correctly, the parser will have to navigate through these potential difficulties and ensure that the Markdown syntax is interpreted as intended by the author of the document."
