Extracting images requires identifying this pattern correctly.\n\n2. **Variations in Syntax**: There can be variations in the Markdown syntax for images, such as reference-style images, where the URL is provided elsewhere in the document, or images with additional attributes such as classes or ids.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative or absolute. A parser must correctly identify and extract the path irrespective of its type.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: Some image URLs might be encoded or contain special characters that need to be decoded or handled properly.\n\n5. **Inline HTML**: Markdown files can also include inline HTML tags. If images are embedded using the `<img>` HTML tag, the parser needs to recognize and handle this as well.\n\n6. **Links with Embedded Images**: Sometimes, an image is embedded within a link. This means that there is nested Markdown syntax that has to be handled carefully.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Text that looks like Markdown image syntax but isn't (e.g., due to typos or escaped characters) should not be incorrectly identified as an image.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be multiple images included on a single line, which means the parser should handle multiple matches within a single line of text.\n\nOnce presented with the actual input file, we can apply these considerations to accurately extract the names of any included image files."
