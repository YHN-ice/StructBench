We need to ensure we catch both formats.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other formatting elements like links, italics, or even within other bold text. We'll have to be careful to extract only the relevant bold text and not get confused by the nesting.\n\n3. **False positives**: There could be instances where asterisks or underscores are used in the document not to denote bold text but as part of regular content (like in a bullet list or in a code block). We need to distinguish these cases.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: If a user wants to display actual asterisks or underscores without formatting, they might escape them using a backslash (`\\`). We should not consider escaped sequences as bold formatting.\n\n5. **In-line code blocks and fenced code blocks**: Text within in-line code blocks (surrounded by backticks `) or fenced code blocks (surrounded by triple backticks ```) should not be parsed as formatted text since they are meant to display raw text.\n\n6. **Partial line formatting**: Some bold text might not span an entire line but just part of it, which means we should look for bold formatting within lines too.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, these considerations will guide us in extracting the correct bold text portions."
