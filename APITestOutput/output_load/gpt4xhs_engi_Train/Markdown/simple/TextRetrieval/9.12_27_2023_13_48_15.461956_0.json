We need to be able to recognize both.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text can have nested formatting, like italic or code spans within it. For example, `**bold _italic_ text**`. It's important to decide whether to include or exclude nested formatting in the extraction.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are part of the Markdown syntax might be escaped to prevent them from being parsed, like `\\**not bold\\**`. We would need to properly ignore these cases.\n\n4. **False positives**: There could be instances where asterisks or underscores are used in the text but not meant to denote bold text. For example, in bullet points, mathematical expressions, or when they're used in pairs for other reasons.\n\n5. **Incomplete markers**: If the Markdown file has errors, such as incomplete bold markers (e.g., `**bold text`), identifying the intended bold text might be challenging.\n\n6. **Inline code blocks**: Text within inline code blocks using backticks should not be considered for formatting, even if they contain what looks like bold markers.\n\nTo provide a correct answer, the parser must correctly handle all these potential issues and extract only the parts of the text that are intended to be bold according to Markdown syntax rules."
