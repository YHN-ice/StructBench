For example:\n   ```\n   ![Alt text][id]\n   ...\n   [id]: image.jpg\n   ```\n\n3. **Images with Titles**: Sometimes an image link may include a title, which can appear after the URL, often in quotes. For example: `![Alt text](image.jpg \"Title\")`.\n\n4. **Inline HTML**: Markdown supports inline HTML, so an image could be included with an `<img>` tag rather than Markdown syntax, for example: `<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Alt text\">`.\n\n5. **Link URLs vs Image URLs**: In Markdown, the syntax for including a link is similar to the syntax for including an image, and distinguishing between the two might require careful parsing.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images could be nested inside other elements like lists or blockquotes, which might complicate parsing since you'll have to consider hierarchy and context.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax might be escaped in the file, which might affect how the parser interprets them.\n\n8. **Incorrect Markdown Formatting**: The file might contain incorrectly formatted Markdown, which doesn't follow the standard rules. While a human reader might still understand it, a parser might not be able to interpret it correctly.\n\nTo accurately extract all image file names, the parser must be able to handle all these cases and any other edge cases defined by the Markdown specification."
