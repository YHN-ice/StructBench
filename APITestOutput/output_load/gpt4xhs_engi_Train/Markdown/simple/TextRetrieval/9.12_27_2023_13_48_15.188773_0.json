The parser must be able to recognize both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text may contain other formatting like italic or code spans, which could affect the extraction process if not handled properly.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks and underscores can be escaped with a backslash `\\`, indicating that they are not being used for formatting. The parser should be able to distinguish between formatting marks and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False positives**: Asterisks or underscores that appear in pairs but are not meant to render text as bold due to spacing issues (e.g., `** not bold **` with spaces close to the asterisks) should not be mistakenly extracted as bold text.\n\n5. **Line breaks**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser should be able to handle line breaks appropriately.\n\n6. **Incomplete syntax**: Situations where the bold syntax is not properly closed (e.g., `**bold text`) could cause issues in identifying bold text correctly.\n\n7. **Ambiguous cases**: There might be ambiguous cases where asterisks or underscores are used in the text for purposes other than formatting, like in mathematical expressions or as bullet points.\n\n8. **Performance and optimization**: Depending on the size of the Markdown file, the parser might need to be optimized for performance.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to take these potential difficulties into account to accurately extract all bold texts."
