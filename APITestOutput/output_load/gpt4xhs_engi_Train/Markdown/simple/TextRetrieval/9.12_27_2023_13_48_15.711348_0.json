Both need to be handled correctly.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold syntax can be used inline with other text which might not be bold. The parser needs to correctly identify and separate the bold text from the rest.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can contain other Markdown formatting like italic or code spans, which could complicate extraction. The parser has to recognize and ignore or properly handle nested formatting.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used as literal characters rather than formatting should not cause text to be falsely identified as bold. The parser must respect escape characters, such as a backslash `\\`, indicating that the following character is not to be treated as a formatting marker.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Text that appears to be formatted as bold but is not rendered as bold due to syntax errors (like missing or unbalanced asterisks/underscores) should not be extracted. The parser needs to ensure that it only extracts correctly formatted bold text.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: If the Markdown supports multiline bold text, the parser must be able to handle and extract bold text that spans multiple lines.\n\nTo provide an accurate extraction, the parser will need to carefully analyze the text to account for these potential issues."
