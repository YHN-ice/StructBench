The most common are double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` before and after the text. My process needs to account for both.\n\n2. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Bold text might contain other markdown elements like italics, links, or even inline code. I must ensure that only the bold text is extracted and not the nested elements unless specified otherwise.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, the asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to display them literally instead of them being used to indicate bold text. I need to discern between actual bold syntax and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False positives**: Text that isn't meant to be bold might be surrounded by asterisks or underscores for other reasons, such as indicating a special term. These should not be confused with bold text.\n\n5. **Multiline Bolds**: Bold text could span multiple lines, which might require handling newline characters within the bold text.\n\n6. **Inconsistencies in formatting**: The Markdown file may have inconsistencies, such as spaces between the asterisks/underscores and the text, which should not be interpreted as bold.\n\n7. **Incomplete Syntax**: Sometimes the closing asterisks or underscores might be missing, which would mean the text is not actually rendered as bold. The parser should correctly identify only properly formatted bold text.\n\nTo extract the bold texts accurately, my process will need to handle each of these potential issues."
