Different Markdown Flavors: Markdown has various flavors (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and they may have slightly different syntax rules for denoting bold text.\n\n2. Multiple Syntaxes for Bold: In Markdown, bold text can typically be created using double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__). We need to consider both cases.\n\n3. Nested Formatting: Bold text may have nested formatting, like italicized words or inline code blocks. We’ll need to ensure only the bold part is extracted, without the nested formatting.\n\n4. Escaped Characters: Users might escape the bold syntax characters (e.g., \\**not bold\\**), which should not be treated as bold.\n\n5. Incomplete Markers: There could be instances where the bold formatting is not closed properly (e.g., **bold text), which may or may not be considered as bold depending on the rules we establish.\n\n6. Multi-line Bold Texts: Bold texts can span multiple lines, and we need to ensure that the extraction carries over line breaks where appropriate.\n\n7. Inline Content: Bold markers might be present within other content, such as in headers, lists, or blockquotes, which may require context-specific handling.\n\nEach of these potential difficulties requires careful consideration to accurately extract all bold texts from the given Markdown file."
