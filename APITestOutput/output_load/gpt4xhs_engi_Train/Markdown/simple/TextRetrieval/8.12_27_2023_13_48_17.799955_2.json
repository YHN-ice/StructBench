The parser should be able to handle both.\n\n3. **Link References**: Markdown allows for images to be included with reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the alt text but is instead referenced at a different part of the document.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may embed HTML for more complex image handling. This could include `<img>` tags with various attributes.\n\n5. **Non-image Files**: Links to non-image files, such as `.pdf` or `.docx`, could be present and should not be confused with image links.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: If the Markdown syntax includes escape characters to display literal brackets or parentheses, it may complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **Nested Elements**: An image link might be nested within other Markdown elements, like a list or a blockquote, and the parser must still identify it correctly.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line, which requires the parser to correctly separate them.\n\n9. **Incorrect or Broken Syntax**: The file may contain syntax errors or broken links, and it could be necessary to decide whether to report these or only extract correctly formatted images.\n\n10. **File Extensions**: The parser should only extract files with image extensions (such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif` etc.), so it must recognize and handle different file types accordingly.\n\nWith these challenges in mind, the parser should be carefully designed to handle various scenarios and edge cases to accurately extract image file names from the Markdown content provided."
