Both are common and should be accounted for.\n\n2. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Bold text can have nested elements like italic, links, or inline code blocks. Depending on the requirement, I may need to handle the nested content differently.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes the bold syntax characters might be escaped to display literally. For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be considered bold text.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: There might be incorrectly formatted bold text which does not render as bold in the final HTML view. For example, `**bold text` (missing an asterisk at the end) should not be treated as bold.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines. The parser must be able to identify and extract these correctly.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text contained within code blocks (triple backticks ``` or indent) or inline code (single backtick `) should not be treated as bold even if it contains bold syntax characters.\n\n7. **Partial Overlaps with Other Formatting**: Bold syntax might partially overlap with other formatting, such as `**bold*italic*text**`, which needs careful handling to extract the correct text.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Bold Syntax**: If there is no space after the opening `**` or before the closing `**`, it might create ambiguity. For example, `**bold**text` could be interpreted differently depending on the parser's rules.\n\nIdentifying and correctly handling these situations will be vital in successfully extracting all bold texts from the provided Markdown file."
