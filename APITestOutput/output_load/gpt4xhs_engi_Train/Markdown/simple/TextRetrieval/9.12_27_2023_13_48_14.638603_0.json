The most common are double asterisks `**text**` and double underscores `__text__`. Both need to be considered for accurate extraction.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting elements like italics, links, or inline code. Ensuring that only the bold text is extracted while preserving or discarding nested formatting as needed can be tricky.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are part of the text itself rather than formatting indicators can be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). The parser must distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete markers**: There could be instances where the Markdown contains an asterisk or underscore that doesn't close, leading to text that is not intended to be bold (e.g., `**not closed). The parser must handle these scenarios gracefully.\n\n5. **Line breaks**: In some Markdown flavors, line breaks might interrupt bold formatting, while in others, they don't. The parser needs to know which rules apply to the input file.\n\n6. **Consistency of input**: Assuming the input follows a consistent Markdown standard is key. However, if it's coming from an inconsistent source or multiple sources with different standards, the task becomes more difficult.\n\n7. **Performance considerations**: Depending on the size of the Markdown file and the complexity of the parser, performance might be an issue, especially if it needs to be run on a large number of files or very large files.\n\nGiven these considerations, a robust Markdown parser would need to carefully inspect the input file and apply the necessary rules to extract the bold text without being misled by false markers or nested formatting."
