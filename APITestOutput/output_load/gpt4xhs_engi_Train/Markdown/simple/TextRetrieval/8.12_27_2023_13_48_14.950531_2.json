The standard way is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but there could be variations or shortcuts used by different Markdown flavors.\n\n2. **Reference-style links**: Some images may be included using reference-style links, where the image source isn't directly in the image tag but is instead referenced elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Markdown Links vs. Images**: Differentiating between Markdown links and images can be a bit tricky since they share similar syntax. Links are in the format `[Link text](URL \"Title\")`, while images have an exclamation mark before the brackets: `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`.\n\n4. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files may embed images using HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax, which would require parsing HTML within the Markdown file.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs or Data URIs**: Images might be included with data URIs or encoded URLs, which might not have recognizable file extension patterns.\n\n6. **Image Titles and Alt Text**: Titles and alt text for images might contain parentheses, brackets, or other characters that could confuse a naive parsing algorithm.\n\n7. **Images Embedded in Tables or Lists**: Images might be embedded within complex structures like tables or lists, which could complicate the regex or pattern matching.\n\n8. **False Positives**: There might be false positives where the pattern might match something that looks like an image syntax but isn't an actual image file (e.g., a commented-out line or a code block).\n\n9. **Nested Markdown**: Markdown within Markdown (e.g., when demonstrating how to use Markdown in a Markdown file), which might include image syntax that isn't meant to represent an actual image in the document.\n\n10. **Escaped Characters**: Image syntax might include escaped characters that need to be handled correctly by the parser.\n\nTo accurately extract all image files, one must consider these potential issues and ensure that the parsing logic is robust enough to handle various scenarios and edge cases."
