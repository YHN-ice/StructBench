I need to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags like italics, strikethroughs, or code blocks, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Inline bold text**: Bold text could be found within a sentence rather than as a standalone line, meaning I need to identify it in the context of other text.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Users might escape the Markdown syntax characters (e.g., by using `\\**not bold\\**`), which would mean that the text is not actually meant to be bold.\n\n5. **Code blocks and inline code**: Bold syntax within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or single backticks for inline code) should not be treated as bold text as it's part of a code snippet.\n\n6. **Links and images**: Bold syntax might be part of a link (`[**bold link text**](url)`) or image description, which could affect the extraction process.\n\n7. **Incomplete or incorrect syntax**: The Markdown file might contain syntax errors or incomplete bold markers that could lead to incorrect parsing of bold text.\n\n8. **False positives from non-Markdown contents**: If the file contains content that looks like Markdown but isn't meant to be (for example, if someone is explaining how to use Markdown), it could lead to incorrect extractions.\n\nFor an accurate extraction, the parser needs to handle these potential difficulties accordingly."
