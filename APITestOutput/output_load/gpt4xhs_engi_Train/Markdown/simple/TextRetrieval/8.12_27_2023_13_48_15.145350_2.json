Extracting file names from absolute URLs should be straightforward, but for relative URLs, the base path isn't always provided, so one might need additional context to resolve the correct file path.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but instead is placed elsewhere in the document with a reference ID. This means that the parser must be able to recognize and resolve these references to find the image file names.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML tags (`<img src=\"...\">`) rather than Markdown syntax. A Markdown parser must be able to recognize and process these as well.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters or Inline Code**: If the Markdown file contains escaped characters or image syntax within inline code blocks (enclosed in backticks `), these should not be treated as actual images.\n\n6. **Alt Text and Titles**: The alternative text and optional titles for images could contain parentheses, brackets, or other characters that might confuse a simple parsing algorithm.\n\n7. **Distractions in Text**: Sometimes, regular text might contain patterns that resemble Markdown image syntax but aren't actual images (e.g., in a discussion about the syntax itself).\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, careful parsing and potentially context-sensitive analysis will be necessary to accurately extract all image file names from the Markdown content."
