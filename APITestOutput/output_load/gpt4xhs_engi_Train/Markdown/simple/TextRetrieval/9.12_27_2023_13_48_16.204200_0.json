The most common are using double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser must be capable of recognizing both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, inline code `` `code` ``, or even other emphasis styles like *italic* or ~~strikethrough~~. The parser should be able to extract the bold text while ignoring or properly handling these nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape markdown syntax characters by preceding them with a backslash `\\`. For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be considered as bold text. The parser must differentiate between escaped and unescaped syntax characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Syntax**: Sometimes, the Markdown might contain incomplete syntax for bold, like `**bold` without a closing `**`. Depending on the requirements, the parser may need to handle or ignore such cases.\n\n5. **Inline with Text**: Bold syntax could be inline with regular text, like this: `text **bold** text`. The parser should only extract \"bold\" and not the surrounding text.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which could complicate the parsing process if the parser is only looking at single lines at a time.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (delimited by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) and inline code (delimited by single backticks) should not be processed for markdown formatting. The parser should ignore bold syntax within these sections.\n\n8. **False Positives**: There could be instances where asterisks or underscores are used in a context that is not meant to denote bold text, such as in mathematical expressions or as bullet points.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, the parser would need to handle these obstacles to accurately extract all bold texts."
