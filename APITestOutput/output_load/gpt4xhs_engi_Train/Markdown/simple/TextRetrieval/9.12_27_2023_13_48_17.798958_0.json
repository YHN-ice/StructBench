We need to account for all these variations.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text may be nested within italic or strikethrough text, like `**bold _italic_ bold**` or `**bold ~~strikethrough~~ bold**`. This requires parsing the nested structures correctly to extract the bold text without the other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: The markdown may contain escaped characters like `\\**not bold\\**`, which should not be treated as bold. The parser should recognize and handle escaped characters properly.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (denoted by backticks, `` `like this` ``) should not be treated as formatted text, even if it contains what looks like Markdown formatting.\n\n5. **Links and Images**: The syntax for links and images may contain asterisks, which could be mistaken for bold syntax. For example: `[link](http://example.com)` or `![image](image-url.jpg)`.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Multi-line code blocks (indented with four spaces or surrounded by triple backticks ```) should not be parsed for markdown formatting.\n\n7. **Line Breaks and Paragraphs**: Bold text may span multiple lines or paragraphs, and the parser should be capable of handling this without breaking the bold formatting.\n\n8. **Incomplete Syntax**: In cases where the syntax is incomplete or incorrect, such as `**bold text`, it might be challenging to decide whether to consider it as bold or not since it is not properly closed.\n\n9. **Lists and Blockquotes**: Bold text within lists or blockquotes may have additional characters (like `*` for list items or `>` for blockquotes) that need to be considered while parsing.\n\nTaking these potential difficulties into account will be crucial for correctly extracting all bold texts from the given Markdown file."
