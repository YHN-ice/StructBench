The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, inline code `` `code` ``, or even other bold or italic markers inside. The parser should only extract the text that is specifically marked as bold, without including any additional markdown formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Bold markers might be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they should not be treated as bold. The parser must recognize and ignore escaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: If the bold markers are not correctly paired (e.g., `**bold` or `bold**`), it might not be clear whether the text should be considered bold or not, and the parser must decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to ensure that it correctly identifies and extracts such instances.\n\n6. **Overlapping or Adjacent Formatting**: Bold text might be adjacent to or overlapped with other formatting like italic (e.g., `**bold**_italic_` or `***bold and italic***`). The parser must accurately distinguish between the different formats and only extract the bold text.\n\n7. **Code Blocks or Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (indented by 4 spaces or fenced by `` ``` ``) or inline code (surrounded by backticks) should not be parsed for markdown formatting.\n\n8. **Performance and Scalability**: If the Markdown file is large, the parser should be efficient enough to handle large volumes of text without significant performance issues.\n\nBefore I can extract the bold texts, you will need to provide the input Markdown file content so I can process it accordingly."
