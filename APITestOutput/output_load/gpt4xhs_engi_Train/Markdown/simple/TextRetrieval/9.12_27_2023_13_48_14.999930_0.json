Here are some of the potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Syntax Variations**: Markdown can use different syntax to denote bold text. Commonly, `**text**` or `__text__` are used to make text bold. A parser must handle both.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might also include other formatting like italics, links, or inline code. For example, `**this is _italic_ and bold**`. Extracting only the bold part while preserving nested formatting might be required.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Bold syntax might be escaped in the Markdown file, meaning it's not intended to be formatted as bold. For example, `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: An incomplete marker for bold such as `**text` (without the closing `**`) could potentially confuse the parser. It needs to be decided whether to consider these as bold or not.\n\n5. **Code Blocks**: Text inside code blocks (indicated by triple backticks `` ``` `` or indentation) should not be treated as formatted text even if it includes bold markers.\n\n6. **Different Line Blocks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to correctly capture multi-line bold text without including non-bold text.\n\nThe parser must handle all of these potential situations to accurately extract bold texts from a Markdown file."
