Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Multiple Markdown Syntax for Bold**: Markdown can use different syntaxes to denote bold text, such as `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`. The parser needs to recognize all the syntaxes used for bold formatting.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, strikethroughs, or even within links or images descriptions. The parser should be able to extract the bold text without including surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the bold indicators (asterisks or underscores) might be escaped with a backslash to display them literally rather than as formatting (`\\**not bold\\**`). The parser needs to distinguish between actual bold formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There might be cases where asterisks or underscores are used in the text not for formatting but for other purposes (e.g., indicating footnotes or as bullet points). The parser should not interpret these as bold formatting.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be instances where the formatting is not correctly applied (e.g., missing one asterisk in `**bold*`). The parser has to decide how to handle such cases—whether to ignore them or try to correct them.\n\n6. **Line Breaks and Inline Formatting**: Bold text can span multiple lines, or it could be inline with other text. The parser must handle both scenarios appropriately.\n\n7. **Code Blocks**: Text within code blocks should not be formatted, so the parser must ignore any formatting inside code blocks.\n\n8. **Other Markdown Elements**: Headings, lists, blockquotes, and other Markdown elements might contain bold text, and the parser should be capable of extracting bold text from within these elements as well.\n\nTo provide an accurate extraction, the parser must address these potential difficulties and apply robust parsing rules to recognize and extract bold text correctly."
