Both should be recognized.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text could contain other markdown elements like links `[link](url)`, inline code `` `code` ``, or italics `*italic*`. Handling nested formatting could be complex depending on the extraction requirements.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores used as literal characters might be escaped with a backslash, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`, which should not be mistaken for bold formatting.\n\n4. **Incorrect formatting**: Users might not follow Markdown syntax properly, e.g., leaving spaces between the asterisks and the text `** not bold **` or not closing the formatting correctly `**bold`.\n\n5. **Line breaks within bold text**: If there's a line break within bold text, it might or might not be considered part of the bold formatting depending on the Markdown parser.\n\n6. **Partial overlaps with other formatting**: Sometimes, bold formatting might start or end within another formatting block, which requires careful parsing to correctly extract the content.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in punctuation**: Some markdown parsers might consider punctuation immediately following the closing delimiter as part of the bold text, while others might not. For example, is the period included in `**bold**.`?\n\nEach of these points could potentially impact the extraction process. The parser must be designed to correctly interpret and handle these situations to accurately extract all bold texts from a Markdown file."
