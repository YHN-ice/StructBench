The most common ways to denote bold text are by using double asterisks `**bold**` or double underscores `__bold__`. We need to ensure that we handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested inside other markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or even inside other bold or emphasis elements. We need to make sure we're correctly identifying bold text even when it's nested.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are used in the text not for bold formatting but as characters themselves, escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). We need to differentiate between actual bold formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Bold syntax within inline code blocks delineated by backticks (`) should not be considered as bold text since they're meant to display code or literals.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Markdown supports bold text that spans across multiple lines. Handling multi-line cases could be more complex due to line breaks.\n\n6. **False Positives**: Situations where double asterisks or underscores are used in the text for reasons other than bold formatting could lead to false positives.\n\nThese factors should be accounted for when parsing the Markdown file to ensure accurate extraction of all bold texts."
