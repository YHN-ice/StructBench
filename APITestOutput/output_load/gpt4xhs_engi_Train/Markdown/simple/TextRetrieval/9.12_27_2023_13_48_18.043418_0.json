The parser must recognize both styles.\n\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text may contain other formatting like italics, code, or links. The parser should be able to handle nested formatting and still correctly identify and extract the bold parts.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Users can escape the bold syntax markers (asterisks and underscores) by using a backslash `\\`. The parser needs to differentiate between actual bold syntax and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Inline formatting vs block elements:** Bold text can be found in a variety of contexts, such as paragraphs, headers, list items, blockquotes, and more. The parser should correctly identify bold text within these different elements.\n\n5. **False positives:** Text that appears to have the bold syntax might not be intended as bold. For example, in cases where asterisks or underscores are used for other purposes (like footnotes or as bullet points).\n\n6. **Link definitions:** Bold text might be within a link label or title, which could complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Incomplete syntax:** There might be cases where the markdown is poorly formatted or incomplete (e.g., missing one asterisk or underscore), which could lead to incorrect identification of bold text.\n\n8. **Multiline bold text:** In some Markdown flavors, bold formatting can span across multiple lines, so the parser would need to be able to detect and handle multiline formatting.\n\nIdentifying and overcoming these obstacles would be necessary for accurately extracting all bold texts from the input Markdown file."
