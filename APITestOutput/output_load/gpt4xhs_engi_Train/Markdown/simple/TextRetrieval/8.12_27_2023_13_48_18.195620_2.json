The standard syntax for images in Markdown is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")` where `Alt text` describes the image, the URL specifies the location of the image file, and \"Title\" is an optional title attribute. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered when trying to extract image files:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: Although there's a standard syntax for images, variations like omitting the alt text (`![](URL)`) or title, or using reference-style links instead of inline links could pose a challenge.\n\n2. **Markdown Flavors**: Different flavors or versions of Markdown might have slight syntax deviations or additional ways to embed images.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image URLs might be absolute URLs (pointing to a location on the web) or relative paths (pointing to a location within the same repository or file system). Only relative paths typically correspond to \"file names\".\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: Some URLs might be encoded (e.g., spaces replaced with `%20`), which needs to be decoded to extract the correct file name.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can contain raw HTML, and images can be embedded using `<img>` tags, which have a different syntax.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Some characters in Markdown may be escaped with a backslash to avoid interpretation as Markdown syntax (e.g., `!\\[Alt text\\](URL)`). These need to be handled appropriately.\n\n7. **Link Definitions Split Across Lines**: The link definition for an image might be split across multiple lines, which requires additional logic to handle line continuations.\n\n8. **Non-image URLs**: Not all URLs in Markdown will point to image files; some could be links to other types of files or websites, so it's important not to assume that all URLs are images.\n\nBy considering these potential obstacles, we can be better prepared to accurately parse and extract image file names from a given Markdown input file."
