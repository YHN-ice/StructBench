Typically, the format is `![Alt text](URL)`.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute file paths**: Image sources can be either absolute URLs pointing to a web resource or relative paths pointing to a file within a directory structure. Handling relative paths correctly requires knowledge of the base path.\n\n3. **Linked images**: Sometimes an image is linked so that when you click the image, it redirects to another URL. It can be slightly more complex to parse because the image and link are nested within each other.\n\n4. **Reference-style images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style linking, where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document. This requires identification and resolution of references.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files may contain embedded HTML tags, including `<img>` tags for images, which have a different syntax from Markdown image links.\n\n6. **Encoded or escaped characters**: File names in URLs may contain URL-encoded characters or escape characters that need to be decoded or unescaped to get the correct file name.\n\n7. **Variants and extensions of Markdown**: Different flavors of Markdown (like GitHub Flavored Markdown) might have slightly different rules or additional features for embedding images.\n\n8. **Text that looks like image syntax**: There could be text within the Markdown file that resembles the image syntax but isn't actually an image, such as examples of Markdown syntax within code blocks or quoted text.\n\n9. **Base64 encoded images**: Images might be embedded directly into the Markdown using Base64 encoding, which can make extraction non-trivial as these are not linked by file paths or URLs.\n\n10. **Distracting content**: Other non-image-related content in the Markdown file might distract from or obscure the search for image file names.\n\nEach of these can present challenges and would need to be accounted for when creating a robust Markdown file parser designed to extract image file names."
