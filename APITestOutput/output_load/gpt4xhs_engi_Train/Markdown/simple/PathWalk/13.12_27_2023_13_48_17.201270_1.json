Sections are typically denoted by headings, which are created using `#` characters. Determining what constitutes a section or sub-section requires parsing heading levels correctly.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Different authors may use different conventions for headings (e.g., `# Heading` vs. `## Heading`). This inconsistency may make it challenging to identify the hierarchy of sections and sub-sections.\n\n3. **Nested Content**: Markdown allows for nested content such as lists, blockquotes, code blocks, and tables. These elements need to be correctly identified and included as part of the section content.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include HTML tags for formatting purposes. A parser must be able to handle these tags appropriately.\n\n5. **Links and References**: Markdown allows for links and reference-style links that could be spread throughout the document. These need to be correctly interpreted in relation to their respective sections.\n\n6. **Images and Media**: Handling image syntax and potentially extracting alt text or titles might be necessary if they are part of the section.\n\n7. **Metadata**: Some Markdown files contain metadata at the beginning of the file (YAML front matter or similar) which is not part of any section but needs to be recognized and handled separately.\n\n8. **Text Formatting**: Markdown uses special characters for formatting text (e.g., `*` for italics, `**` for bold). The parser must maintain these formatting marks in the excerpt.\n\n9. **Anchors and Footnotes**: If the document uses anchors or footnotes, the parser must include them correctly without breaking their context within the section.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, the parser should be designed to robustly handle Markdown syntax, maintain the integrity of the document structure, and accurately extract the desired content inclusive of all relevant elements."
