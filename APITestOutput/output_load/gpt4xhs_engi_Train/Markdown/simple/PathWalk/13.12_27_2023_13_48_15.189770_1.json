I'll need to identify the heading levels correctly to extract the complete section.\n\n2. **Ambiguous Headings**: Markdown headings can be ambiguous since they are defined by the number of `#` characters. A section might have multiple headings with the same level, which can make it difficult to determine which heading starts the section you're interested in.\n\n3. **Formatting Variations**: Markdown allows for variations in formatting, such as underlined headings or different list types. These variations could affect how content is parsed and identified.\n\n4. **Links and Images**: A section might contain links and images with alt text and URLs. Ensuring these are correctly represented in the excerpt might be challenging.\n\n5. **Inline Markup**: Emphasis, strong emphasis, inline code, and other inline markup should be preserved in the excerpt, which could be tricky depending on how it's used throughout the text.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Quotations**: The section might include code blocks or block quotations, which need to be handled differently from regular text to preserve their formatting.\n\n7. **Tables**: If the section contains tables, parsing them correctly while keeping the alignment and structure could be an obstacle.\n\n8. **Distinguishing Content from Comments**: Markdown files can also have comments that are not visible in rendered documents but may appear in raw Markdown. It's important to discern if such comments should be included in the excerpt.\n\nTo handle these obstacles effectively, I would need to parse the Markdown structure carefully, recognizing different levels of headings to delimit sections accurately and preserving the original formatting of the content within those sections."
