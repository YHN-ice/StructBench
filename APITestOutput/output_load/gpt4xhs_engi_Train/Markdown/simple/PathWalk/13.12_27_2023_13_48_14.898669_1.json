Extracting just the top-level content without the subsections might be required.\n\n4. **Link and Image References:**\n   - Managing links and images, which have specific syntax, and deciding whether to include link URLs or alt text in the output.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:**\n   - Code blocks (` ``` `) and inline code (`` ` ``) must be handled so they are not mistaken for regular text.\n\n6. **Tables:**\n   - Tables have a specific syntax in Markdown, which might need to be preserved or parsed differently.\n\n7. **Order of Sections:**\n   - Determining the \"1th section\" may require counting headings correctly, noting that Markdown does not have explicit section numbering.\n\n8. **File Size and Complexity:**\n   - Large files with many sections can complicate the parsing process and increase the likelihood of errors.\n\n9. **Non-standard Extensions:**\n   - Some Markdown flavors introduce non-standard features or syntax extensions which could complicate parsing.\n\n10. **Ambiguity in the Term 'Section':**\n    - The term 'section' may refer to content under a level 1 heading, or it could be interpreted to include content under subsequent related subheadings.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser must be capable of recognizing and correctly interpreting the various Markdown elements and structure."
