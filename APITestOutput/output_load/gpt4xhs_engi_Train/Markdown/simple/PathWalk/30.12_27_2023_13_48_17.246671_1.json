The parser must handle these elements correctly while extracting text content.\n\n5. **Ambiguity in Heading Levels**: If a document doesn't follow a strict structure (e.g., jumping from a level 1 heading directly to a level 3 heading), it may be challenging to determine the hierarchy and which headings are considered subsections.\n\n6. **Additional Markup**: Besides traditional headings and paragraphs, Markdown supports lists, blockquotes, horizontal rules, tables, and more. These elements could be part of the subsection content that needs to be accurately included in the output.\n\n7. **Textual Content vs. Metadata**: Markdown files can also include metadata blocks (like YAML front matter), which are not part of the main content and should generally not be included in an excerpt unless specified.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser must be robust enough to interpret the Markdown structure and content accurately to provide the requested excerpt."
