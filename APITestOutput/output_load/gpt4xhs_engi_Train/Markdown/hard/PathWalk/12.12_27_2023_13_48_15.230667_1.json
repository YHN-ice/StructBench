The parser must maintain these formats in the excerpt if they are part of the content.\n6. **Links and Images**: If the subsection includes links or images, correctly extracting them with their respective Markdown syntax could be complex.\n7. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: There are different flavors of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and they might have slightly different rules for parsing.\n\nThese potential issues need to be addressed by the parser to ensure an accurate extraction of the requested content.
