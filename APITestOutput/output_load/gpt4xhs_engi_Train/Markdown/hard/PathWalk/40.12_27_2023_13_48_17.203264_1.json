The parser must correctly interpret these to identify the relevant parts of the document.\n\n3. **Ambiguity in Naming**: The terms \"1th\" and \"2th\" are unconventional and could be typos for \"1st\" and \"2nd.\" Clarification is needed to ensure we are looking for the correct sections.\n\n4. **Indexing Conventions**: The question assumes a 1-based index (the \"1st\" item refers to the first item).

For example, if a subsection is not correctly marked or indented, it may not be recognized as such.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: If the specified section or subsection does not exist, the parser needs to have a way to handle that gracefully and inform the user accordingly.\n\nOnce we have access to the Markdown file, we can address these potential difficulties more specifically."
