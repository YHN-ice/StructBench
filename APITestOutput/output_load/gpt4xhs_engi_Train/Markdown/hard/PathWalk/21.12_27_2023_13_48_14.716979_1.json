Ensuring that this formatting is preserved in the excerpt might require careful handling.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Quotes**: Code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or indentation) and blockquotes (indicated by `>`) also need to be handled correctly to ensure they are included in the excerpt if they are part of the content.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Internal document links or references to images need to be preserved as they appear in the Markdown file.\n\n7. **Tables**: If tables are present in the Markdown file, they have a specific syntax that must be correctly interpreted and preserved in the excerpt.\n\nUnderstanding how to navigate these potential challenges is crucial for parsing the Markdown file and extracting the exact content needed.
