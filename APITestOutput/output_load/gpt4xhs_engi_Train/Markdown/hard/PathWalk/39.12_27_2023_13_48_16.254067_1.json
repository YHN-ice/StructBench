This inconsistency could affect the parsing process.\n\n5. **Content Identification**: Once the correct heading is located, I need to extract the content up to the next heading of the same or higher level without missing any text or including content from other sections.\n\n6. **Link References and Footnotes**: Markdown syntax for links and footnotes can be complex, and ensuring they are correctly interpreted in the context of the excerpt might be necessary.\n\n7. **Embedded HTML or Other Markup**: Sometimes Markdown files contain HTML or other markup, which could complicate text extraction.\n\n8. **File Size and Complexity**: A very large or complex Markdown file could present performance issues or make it harder to accurately navigate to the correct section.\n\nOnce any ambiguities in the question are resolved and the input file is provided, these obstacles must be considered and addressed in order to parse the file correctly and provide an accurate answer."
