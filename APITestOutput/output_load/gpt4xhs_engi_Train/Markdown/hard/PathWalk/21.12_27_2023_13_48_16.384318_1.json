For example, the creator might have skipped a level or used different styles for similar levels.\n\n3. Nested Content: Subsections and subsubsections might contain nested lists, code blocks, quotes, or other elements that make it difficult to determine where the content of a specific subsubsection ends.\n\n4. Ambiguity in Indexing: The question uses \"1th\" and \"2th,\" which are unconventional and might imply \"1st\" and \"2nd.\" It's necessary to clarify if it refers to the first and second sections, subsections, etc.\n\n5. Multiple Matches: There could be multiple subsubsections under a subsection, making it crucial to correctly identify the first one.\n\n6.
