Identifying the correct level for the \"1th subsection under 1th section\" will be necessary.\n\n3. **Non-Standard Markdown**: If the Markdown file does not adhere to standard Markdown syntax, it could pose challenges in identifying headings and subsections.\n\n4. **Ambiguities in Reference**: The term \"1th\" is unconventional and might be a typo for \"1st\". Deciding whether to interpret \"1th\" as \"1st\" or to treat it as an invalid reference could affect the response.\n\n5. **Multilingual or Encoded Content**: The content might be in a different language or encoded in some way, making it difficult to extract without proper decoding or understanding of the language.\n\n6. **Large Files and Performance**: If the Markdown file is exceptionally large, performance considerations may come into play, potentially slowing down the parsing process.\n\n7. **Embedded Media or Links**: The presence of embedded media, images, or links might complicate the extraction of plain text content.\n\n8. **Formatting Elements**: Markdown files can contain various formatting elements like bold or italic text, lists, blockquotes, etc., which need to be accurately represented in the extracted content.\n\n9. **Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks or syntax highlighting indicated by triple backticks (```) or tildes (`~~~`) might need to be handled differently from regular text.\n\n10. **Tables and Other Structures**: Tables, definition lists, and other advanced structures may require specific parsing logic to extract information correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must correctly interpret Markdown syntax, maintain the content hierarchy during parsing, and handle any non-standard or ambiguous references appropriately."
