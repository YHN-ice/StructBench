The parser must extract only the bold text while ignoring or properly handling the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used as literals rather than formatting indicators (escaped with a backslash) should not be treated as bold markers.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Situations where asterisks or underscores are not used for formatting, such as in lists or horizontal rules, should not be confused with bold text.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be cases where the formatting is not properly closed (e.g., missing an asterisk or underscore), leading to ambiguity whether the text should be considered bold or not.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Sections on the Same Line**: A line may contain multiple bold sections, and the parser must correctly identify and separate each section.\n\n7. **Line Breaks Inside Bold Text**: Markdown supports line breaks within bold text, which the parser has to handle without breaking the bold formatting.\n\n8. **Contextual Awareness**: Bold syntax might appear inside code blocks or inline code, where it should not be interpreted as bold formatting.\n\nTo successfully extract all bold texts, the parser must correctly interpret the Markdown syntax and handle these potential issues appropriately."
