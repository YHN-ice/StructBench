However, variations exist such as different alt text descriptions or use of HTML `<img>` elements instead of Markdown syntax. A parser must handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Inline vs Reference Style Links**: Images in Markdown can be included using inline links (where the URL is placed directly after the alt text), or reference style links (where the URL is referenced elsewhere in the document). The parser must account for both styles.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image links might be relative paths pointing within the repository or project, or absolute URLs pointing to an external resource. The parser has to differentiate and extract the correct filenames.\n\n4. **Links Containing Markdown Elements**: Sometimes, URLs or alt text can contain characters that are also used in Markdown for formatting, such as parentheses, brackets, or backticks. The parser must correctly interpret these characters within the context of a URL without mistaking them for Markdown formatting.\n\n5. **Embedded Images within Other Elements**: Images can be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables. The parser needs to be able to find images within these structures.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Filenames or paths might include escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There could be multiple images on a single line, separated by text or other markdown elements which the parser needs to handle correctly.\n\n8. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support non-standard extensions that allow for additional image properties like classes, ids, or other attributes. The parser might need to ignore these or handle them accordingly.\n\n9. **File Extensions**: Not all images will necessarily have standard image file extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. The parser should be flexible enough to recognize different extensions.\n\n10. **Distinction from Links**: Image syntax is similar to link syntax in Markdown (`![text](url)` vs `[text](url)`). The parser must distinguish between the two and not extract regular hyperlinks as images.\n\nWe will need to consider these challenges while parsing the input Markdown file to ensure accurate extraction of image filenames."
