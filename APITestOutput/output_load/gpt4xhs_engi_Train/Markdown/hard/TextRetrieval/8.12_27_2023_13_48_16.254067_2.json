For example, `![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)` is the standard Markdown syntax, but variations can include reference-style images, HTML image tags, or even images within links.\n\n2. **Variants in file path**: The file path used in the image syntax could come in different forms, such as absolute URLs (`http://example.com/image.jpg`), relative paths (`./images/photo.png`), or even with additional parameters (`/path/to/img.jpg?size=50x50`).\n\n3. **Escape characters**: Sometimes image syntax might include escape characters that need to be correctly parsed out, such as in `!\\[Alt text]\\(/path/to/img.jpg)`.\n\n4. **False positives**: When searching for image patterns, it's possible to encounter false positives. For example, similar patterns may appear in code blocks or inline code segments, where they are not intended to display an image.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown elements**: Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which may require consideration when parsing.\n\n6. **Multiple images on one line**: Some Markdown files might include multiple images on a single line, which would require the parser to correctly separate and identify each image file.\n\n7. **Alt text variations**: The alternative text for images (`![Alt text]`) might include special characters or formatting, which could complicate the extraction process if not handled correctly.\n\nNow let's proceed with the input file and attempt to extract all included image filenames from the Markdown content provided.
