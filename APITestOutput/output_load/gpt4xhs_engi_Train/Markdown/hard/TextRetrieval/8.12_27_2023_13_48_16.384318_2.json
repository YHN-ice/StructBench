Each has a different syntax, which can complicate extraction if not accounted for.\n   \n2. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes image syntax might include escaped characters that are not meant to be interpreted as Markdown but as literal characters, which could potentially lead to false positives.\n\n3. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes. The parser must correctly identify these cases and still extract the image details.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links can be given as relative paths or absolute URLs. The extraction process should account for both and not assume one over the other.\n\n5. **Link References Not Near Images**: In the case of reference-style images, the actual URL may be placed anywhere in the document, separate from where the image is referenced. This means the parser can't just look locally around the image tag but must scan the entire document for the referenced link.\n\n6. **Alternate Text Complexity**: Markdown images include alternate text, which can sometimes contain brackets or other characters that might confuse a simple parsing algorithm.\n\n7. **Invalid Image Links**: Some links might appear to be images due to their syntax but lead to broken URLs or invalid files. While not necessarily a parsing issue, it's something that might need attention depending on the context of the task.\n\n8. **Non-image Links**: Sometimes links might appear like image links but aren't actually images (for example, a link ending with `.md`). Differentiating between these and actual images is crucial.\n\n9. **Variety of File Extensions**: Images can have a variety of file extensions (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser should not assume only one type.\n\n10. **Handling Markdown Comments**: If Markdown comments are present, they might contain image-like syntax that shouldn't be parsed as part of the document content.\n\nTo handle these issues effectively, the parser would have to be robust enough to accurately identify true image syntax while managing these potential complications."
