It's important to handle both notations correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis:** Bold text can contain other formatting, like italic (_italic_) which in Markdown is denoted by single asterisks or underscores around the text (`*italic*` or `_italic_`). It can be a challenge to extract only the bold part without including the formatting of nested emphasis.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Asterisks and underscores can be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to indicate that they should be treated as literal characters rather than Markdown formatting. The parser needs to recognize when asterisks or underscores are escaped and should not be treated as formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting:** There might be cases where the formatting syntax is not completed, such as `**bold` without a closing `**`. The parser needs to decide how to handle these incomplete cases.\n\n5. **Links and Images:** Bold formatting can include links (`[link text](URL)`) or images (`![alt text](image URL)`). Extracting the bold text without accidentally pulling in markdown syntax for links and images can be complex.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks (indented by four spaces or fenced by backticks) and inline code (surrounded by backticks) should not be treated as formatted text. The parser must distinguish between code and regular text.\n\n7. **Line Breaks:** In Markdown, line breaks can affect formatting. For instance, double asterisks may span across multiple lines, so the parser should correctly handle line continuation.\n\nBefore proceeding to parse the given Markdown file, these are some of the considerations that might affect the process of extracting bold texts accurately."
