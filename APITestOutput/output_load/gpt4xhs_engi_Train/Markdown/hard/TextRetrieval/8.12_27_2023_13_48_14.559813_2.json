The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but there may be variations or shortcuts used, and links can be inline or reference-style.\n\n2. **Image URLs vs File Names**: An image can be included with a full URL or just a file name. Extracting the file name might require parsing the URL correctly to get the last part after the last '/' character.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths might be absolute (starting with a scheme such as `http://` or `https://`) or relative (not starting with a scheme). This affects how we determine what constitutes a file name.\n\n4. **Image Links in HTML Tags**: Sometimes images are included using HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax (`<img src=\"filename.jpg\" />`), and these need to be handled as well.\n\n5. **Images in Links**: Images might be nested within links. This means the parser needs to ignore the surrounding link syntax to extract just the image information.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows escaping characters that would otherwise be interpreted as syntax, so a parser must recognize when image syntax is actually escaped and should not be treated as an image.\n\n7. **Non-image Links**: The parser must differentiate between image syntax and similar syntax used for links, which do not contain images.\n\n8. **Comments and Other Non-rendered Text**: Markdown can include HTML comments which might contain image-like syntax that should not be counted since it's not rendered.\n\n9. **Variants and Extensions**: There are many Markdown variants and extensions that might change how images are included, such as Markdown Extra or GitHub-Flavored Markdown with their own additional syntax rules.\n\nThese are some of the potential issues that could complicate the task of extracting image file names from a Markdown file. Once I see the input file, I'll be able to apply the appropriate parsing rules to extract the image files."
