The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but variations might not include the alt text or title.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style image links where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document. This can make it tricky to extract the file name if you don't also parse the references.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Some images might be linked with absolute URLs, while others might use relative paths. Only file names should be extracted, which means parsing out any preceding directory structures or domain names.\n\n4. **Linked Images**: An image might also be a hyperlink, which adds another layer of syntax to parse through.\n\n5. **Non-image Links**: It's important to differentiate between image syntax and link syntax to avoid extracting non-image files.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Markdown allows for escape characters to display literal characters that would otherwise be interpreted as Markdown syntax. This could affect parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n7. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using raw HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n8. **Image File Extensions**: It's necessary to identify what constitutes an image file based on its extension (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and not accidentally extract other types of files.\n\n9. **Duplication**: The same image file might be included multiple times in the document, so deduplication might be necessary depending on the requirements.\n\n10. **File Name Formatting**: File names might include spaces, special characters, or different casing, which should all be handled consistently when extracting them.\n\nWith all these potential obstacles in mind, the process would need to be thorough and account for various Markdown syntaxes and edge cases while extracting the image file names."
