When parsing a Markdown file to extract all included image files and print their file names, several difficulties and obstacles could arise:\n\n1. **Different Image Syntaxes**: Markdown supports different syntaxes for embedding images. The most common is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but there could be variations or shortcuts used by different Markdown processors.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs. Distinguishing between them might be necessary, depending on what information you're looking to extract.\n\n3. **Variable Alt Text**: The alternative text description for images can vary greatly and sometimes may include parentheses or brackets, which could complicate parsing if not accounted for.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style links and images which can separate the URL from the image tag. This means an image file name might not be immediately after the `!` and `[` symbols.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might contain raw HTML as a fallback or for additional customization. `<img>` tags could be used to embed images and would need to be parsed separately from Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: File names could include characters that are typically escaped in Markdown, such as spaces or special characters, making it harder to extract the correct file name.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown**: Sometimes Markdown is nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes. Ensuring the parser correctly identifies image syntax within these contexts is important.\n\n8. **Non-standard Extensions**: There might be non-standard Markdown extensions in use that affect how images are embedded.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust Markdown parser must account for different syntax variations, handle both relative and absolute path extraction, and deal with the various ways images can be included in a Markdown document. Now, if you provide the input file, I will do my best to parse it and extract the image file names accordingly."
