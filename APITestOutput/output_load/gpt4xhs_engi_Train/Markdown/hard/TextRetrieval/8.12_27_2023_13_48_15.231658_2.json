Here's an example:\n\n```\n![alt text](path/to/image.jpg)\n```\n\nPotential difficulties in parsing the file might include:\n\n1. Different variations of Markdown syntax: While the above example is standard, some Markdown flavors might use slightly different syntax for embedding images.\n2. Relative vs. absolute paths: Images might be included using relative or full paths, and identifying the file name might require parsing the path correctly.\n3. Inline HTML: Some Markdown files may include images using HTML `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n4. Image references: Markdown allows for reference-style image links, where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document.\n5. Non-image files: Ensuring that only image files are extracted and not other file types that might also be included in parentheses.\n6. Alt text edge cases: The alt text might contain brackets or other characters that could confuse a simple parser.\n7. Escaped characters: In some cases, parts of the image syntax might be escaped to avoid being processed as an image.\n\nGiven these potential issues, it would be important to carefully parse the file and handle each of these edge cases to ensure accurate extraction of image files.
