It's necessary to recognize both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements inside it, such as links `[link](url)`, code snippets `` `code` ``, or even other bold/italic markers. Extracting only the bold text requires handling these nested elements properly.\n\n3. **False positives**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be used in the text for purposes other than creating bold text, such as in mathematical expressions or to denote emphasis without formatting (e.g., `I *really* need this`). These should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are escaped with a backslash `\\*not bold\\*` should not be interpreted as bold formatting.\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser needs to be able to recognize the end of the bold section even if it's not on the same line as the start.\n\n6. **Inconsistent formatting**: Users might inadvertently mix syntaxes or forget to close their bold markers, leading to improperly formatted text that still might be intended as bold (e.g., `**bold __text**`). It may be necessary to decide how strict the parser should be in these cases.\n\n7. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is very large, efficiently parsing the file without excessive resource consumption could be a concern.\n\nIt's important to consider these potential difficulties when parsing a Markdown file to ensure that all bold texts are extracted accurately.
