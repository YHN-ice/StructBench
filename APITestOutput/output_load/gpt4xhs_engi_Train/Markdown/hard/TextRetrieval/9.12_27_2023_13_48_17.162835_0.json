We need to be prepared to handle both.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text may have other formatting nested inside it, such as italics or code spans. We'll have to ensure that the extraction process accounts for nested formatting but extracts only the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: In Markdown, characters like asterisks can be escaped with a backslash to be treated as literal characters rather than formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold**`. We need to differentiate between actual bold syntax and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False positives**: Text might contain sequences of asterisks or underscores that are not meant for bold formatting, like in a URL or a code block. We need to ensure these are not incorrectly interpreted as bold.\n\n5. **Inline vs block level**: Bold text could appear within a paragraph (inline) or as part of a larger block element like a list or header. The parser should correctly extract bold text regardless of where it appears.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text**: Sometimes, bold text might span multiple lines, so we should consider multiline scenarios while extracting.\n\n7. **Partial overlaps**: There might be overlaps where part of the text is bold, and part of it is italic or some other formatting. We'll need to carefully parse such overlaps to correctly extract the bold part.\n\n8. **Markdown variations and extensions**: Different flavors of Markdown might have slight variations in syntax. If the Markdown file follows a specific flavor or uses extensions that modify the bold syntax, we'll need to adjust our parsing accordingly.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I will be able to provide a more tailored response to extract the bold texts."
