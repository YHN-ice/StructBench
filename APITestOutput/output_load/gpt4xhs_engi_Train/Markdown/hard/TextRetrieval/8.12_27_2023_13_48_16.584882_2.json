A parser has to correctly identify and extract the file name from both types of paths.\n\n3. **Images Linked within HTML Tags**: Sometimes Markdown files embed HTML tags, and images could be included using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown's own syntax.\n\n4. **Distractions in Text**: There might be non-image URLs or other uses of parentheses and brackets that could be mistaken for image syntax.\n\n5. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the alt text but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. **Encoded URLs**: The URLs for images might be URL-encoded (percent encoding), especially if they include spaces or special characters.\n\n7. **Different File Extensions**: Images can have a variety of file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser must recognize all possible valid image file types.\n\n8. **Handling Escaped Characters**: In some cases, characters within a Markdown file may be escaped (e.g., `\\!` instead of `!`), which can affect whether something is interpreted as an image.\n\n9. **Document Structure Complexity**: Depending on the structure of the Markdown document, it may be more challenging to parse, especially if there's a mix of Markdown and HTML or nested structures.\n\n10. **Image Titles or Additional Attributes**: Some Markdown renderers support titles or additional attributes for images, which could complicate the extraction pattern.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a Markdown file parser needs to be carefully designed with regex patterns or parsing strategies that can accurately identify and extract just the image file names while taking into account the context in which they appear."
