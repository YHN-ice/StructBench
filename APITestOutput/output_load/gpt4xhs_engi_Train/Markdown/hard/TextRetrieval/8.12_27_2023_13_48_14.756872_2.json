It's important to handle all cases.\n\n2. **Complex Image Paths**: Image paths may include directories, query strings, and anchors, which could complicate extraction if you're looking for simple filenames.\n\n3. **Images Included as HTML**: Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax. This requires parsing HTML within the Markdown document.\n\n4. **Image References without Extensions**: Occasionally, image references may not include the file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`), especially if they are dynamically loaded or if the server is configured to serve images without needing the extension in the URL.\n\n5. **Alt Text Confusion**: The alt text for an image might contain brackets or parentheses, potentially leading to confusion when trying to parse it if the parser is not carefully designed.\n\n6. **Link and Image Syntax Overlaps**: The syntax for images is similar to that for links, with the difference being an exclamation mark before the first bracket for images. If this subtle difference is overlooked, links could be mistaken for images.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images may be nested inside other elements like lists or block quotes, which may require context-aware parsing to handle correctly.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Characters used in the Markdown syntax may be escaped (e.g., `\\![]()`), meaning they should not be treated as image syntax but as literal characters.\n\n9. **Non-Standard Extensions**: Some Markdown parsers support non-standard extensions that could affect image syntax, so it's important to know what flavor of Markdown you're dealing with.\n\n10. **External Image References**: Some images may be referenced externally in a way that doesn't include a direct URL or path in the Markdown file itself (e.g., through a configuration file or database).\n\n11. **Encoding Issues**: File paths or URLs may include encoded characters that need to be decoded to obtain the correct file names."
