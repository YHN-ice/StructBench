Deciding how to handle these cases can be tricky.\n\n5. **Text across multiple lines:** Bold text might span across multiple lines. We need to make sure to capture the entire bold section even when it's not contained within a single line.\n\n6. **Overlapping formatting:** There might be overlapping formatting where a section of text is both bold and italic or otherwise formatted.
