Handling both correctly is necessary to extract the file names properly.\n\n3. **Image references**: Markdown also allows for reference-style image links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document. This requires parsing and connecting the reference to the actual URL.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files contain HTML tags alongside traditional Markdown syntax. Images might be embedded using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Link vs. image**: Distinguishing between image links and hyperlinks is important, as they can have similar syntax. An image will have an exclamation mark (`!`) at the beginning, which is not present for regular links.\n\n6. **Escape characters**: Markdown allows for escape characters to prevent certain characters from being interpreted as Markdown commands. This means some image-like patterns might be escaped and actually not represent images.\n\n7. **File extensions**: Assuming that image files will have common extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) is usually safe, but there might be images with less common extensions or even without an extension that should still be recognized.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we can apply these considerations to accurately extract all included image file names."
