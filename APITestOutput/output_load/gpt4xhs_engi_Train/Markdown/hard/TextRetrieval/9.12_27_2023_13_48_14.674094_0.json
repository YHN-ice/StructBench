When parsing Markdown to extract bold text, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Different Formatting for Bold**: Depending on the Markdown flavor, bold text can be formatted with double asterisks `**bold text**`, double underscores `__bold text__`, or a combination of both. The parser must handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formats**: Bold text might contain other Markdown formats inside it, such as italics, code, or links. These nested formats could complicate extraction if the goal is to get only the raw text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used as literals rather than formatting characters can be escaped with a backslash. The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters (`\\**not bold\\**`).\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, the formatting markers might not be correctly closed (`**bold`). The parser has to decide how to handle these occurrences.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text that spans multiple lines might pose a problem since some Markdown parsers require inline formatting to be on a single line.\n\n6. **Other Markdown Elements**: Headings, lists, and other elements might use asterisks or underscores, and the parser should not confuse these with bold formatting.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Parsing**: In some cases, the same sequence of characters could be interpreted differently depending on context (e.g., `**bold**text` could be seen as one word in bold or two separate words).\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is very large, performance considerations may come into play, impacting how the parser is implemented.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser will need to address these challenges effectively."
