The most common pattern is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations may exist, and we need to be prepared to recognize them.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Images can be linked using either relative paths from the current document or absolute URLs. Processing and recognizing both types are important.\n\n3. **Images within HTML tags**: Sometimes images are embedded in Markdown using raw HTML tags (`<img src=\"...\">`). This requires parsing HTML within the Markdown file.\n\n4. **Reference-style links**: Markdown allows for reference-style linking, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but is instead referenced elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: Some images might have URLs that are URL-encoded, and decoding might be necessary to get the correct file name.\n\n6. **Escape characters**: File names or paths can include escape characters or spaces that are part of the file name or are used to escape special Markdown characters.\n\n7. **Embedded data URIs**: Instead of referencing a file, an image source could be a data URI, which is not a file to extract but rather embedded data.\n\n8. **Linked images**: There might be Markdown syntax linking an image to a URL, which complicates the pattern matching.\n\n9. **Commented-out images**: Some images could be commented out if Markdown comments or HTML comments are used, which means they should probably not be extracted as active images.\n\n10. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be nested inside other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which may alter the expected syntax slightly.\n\n11. **False positives**: Other non-image file links or unrelated syntax elements might resemble image links but aren't actually images.\n\nTo successfully extract all image files, the parser must be robust against these potential issues and should be able to accurately identify all legitimate image links or references within the Markdown content."
