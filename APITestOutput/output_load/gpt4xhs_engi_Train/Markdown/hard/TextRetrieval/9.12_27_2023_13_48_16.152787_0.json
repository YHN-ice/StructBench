The parser needs to be able to identify both as bold text.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text may be nested inside other formatting elements like italics, blockquotes, lists, or code blocks. The parser should be able to extract bold text even within these contexts but not confuse formatting marks within code blocks as bold syntax.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax can be escaped with a backslash to display them literally (e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`). The parser should recognize these escape characters and not interpret escaped formatting characters as bold syntax.\n\n4. **Incomplete syntax**: Sometimes, the syntax might not be perfectly closed (e.g., `**bold` without a closing `**`). Depending on the rules we follow, the parser may or may not consider these as bold text.\n\n5. **Overlapping syntax**: There might be instances where bold syntax overlaps with other Markdown syntax elements (e.g., `**bold _italic bold_**`). The parser must handle these correctly and only extract the bold text.\n\n6. **Line breaks**: Line breaks in Markdown can be tricky. If there is a new line in between the syntax, it may or may not break the parsing depending on how strict the parser rules are (e.g., `**bold text` and on a new line `more bold text**`).\n\n7. **False positives**: Text that may appear to be bold because of the presence of asterisks or underscores might not be intended as bold. For instance, asterisks are also used for bullet points, and underscores might be part of a URL or identifier.\n\n8. **Multiple instances**: There may be multiple instances of bold text within the file, and it’s important to ensure they are all extracted without missing any.\n\nOnce these potential difficulties are accounted for, we can move forward with parsing the given Markdown file and extract the bold texts accurately."
