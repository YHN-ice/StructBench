Each requires different parsing strategies.\n\n2. **Image URLs vs. File Names**: An image link may be a full URL or a relative path to a file. We need to distinguish between URLs that point to external resources and actual file names that are included in the Markdown content.\n\n3. **Alternative Text**: The presence of alternative text (alt text) might complicate the extraction if not handled properly, especially if the alt text contains parentheses or brackets that could be mistaken for part of the image URL or file name.\n\n4. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes, which could complicate parsing if not accounted for.\n\n5. **Reference-style Links**: Images might use a reference-style link where the URL is not in the same place as the image reference itself, but instead placed elsewhere in the document, linked by a reference label.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: The presence of escape characters within the Markdown may affect how the text is parsed, particularly if they are used in proximity to image syntax characters.\n\n7. **File Path Complexity**: The file paths to images might include directories, special characters, or spaces, which may require additional logic to correctly extract just the file names.\n\n8. **Non-image Files**: Ensuring that only image files are extracted and not links to non-image files which could also be present in the Markdown.\n\n9. **Markdown Variants**: There may be slight differences in how different Markdown flavors (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown or CommonMark) handle images, which might affect parsing.\n\n10. **Comments or Metadata**: Some Markdown files might have comments or metadata that could include image-like syntax but are not meant to be displayed as images.\n\nTo address these challenges, a careful approach to parsing is required, potentially using regular expressions or a dedicated Markdown parsing library that can handle these various scenarios accurately."
