Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may contain other formatted elements like italics, code, or links. We need to ensure that we only extract the bold text without the nested formatting.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are meant to be displayed literally (not as formatting) can be escaped with a backslash (`\\`). We'll need to correctly handle these cases by not treating them as formatting markers.\n\n3. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, there could be errors in the Markdown file with incomplete markers (e.g., only one asterisk or one underscore) which are not meant to format text as bold. We should be careful not to consider these as bold text.\n\n4. **Code Blocks or Inline Code**: Bold syntax within code blocks or inline code should not be treated as bold text, as the formatting doesn't apply in code contexts.\n\n5. **Alternative Formatting**: Markdown also has alternative formatting styles, such as underlines created with HTML tags, which might not be marked by asterisks or underscores but are meant to represent bold text.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might be split across multiple lines; we need to ensure that these cases are correctly identified and handled.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the process of parsing and extracting bold text would involve scanning the file for pairs of asterisks or underscores that enclose text, ensuring that the formatting is valid and not part of an escape sequence or code block, and then collecting and printing the raw texts separated by a newline character."
