It is important to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text can also be nested with italic or other markdown elements, like `**bold _and italic_**`. Extracting just the bold part could be more complex if the requirement is to ignore nested styles.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes users might escape the markdown syntax to prevent formatting, like `\\**not bold\\**`. It's essential to detect and skip escaped syntax to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Incorrect Usage**: Markdown formatting can break if not used correctly. For instance, unmatched asterisks or underscores (`**bold text`) won't render text as bold but might be mistaken for bold syntax in a simple parsing algorithm.\n\n5. **Different Contexts**: Bold syntax can appear within different contexts, such as headings, lists, or blockquotes. It is necessary to recognize bold text regardless of where it appears within a Markdown document.\n\n6. **Code Blocks**: Text within inline code `code` or fenced code blocks should not be interpreted as bold, even if it contains `**double asterisks**`.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: If the bold syntax is split across multiple lines, it might be challenging to detect and correctly interpret.\n\n8. **Performance**: For large Markdown files, performance could be an issue if the parsing algorithm isn't optimized.\n\n9. **Compatibility**: Different Markdown parsers and platforms (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) might have slight variations in how they interpret and render bold text, which could affect the expected results.\n\nEach of these issues would require careful consideration to accurately parse and extract bold text from a Markdown file."
