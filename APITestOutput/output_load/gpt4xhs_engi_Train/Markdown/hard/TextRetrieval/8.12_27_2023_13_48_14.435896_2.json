The most common one is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there might be variations or shortcuts used in different Markdown processors, or images included as HTML tags.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked with relative paths or absolute URLs. It's important to discern whether you want only the names of the image files or also the paths/URLs associated with them.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows images to be embedded using reference-style links, which can separate the image link from the place it's displayed. This means the parser must be able to recognize references and correlate them with the actual image URLs defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, images are embedded using raw HTML within a Markdown file. This requires the parser to recognize HTML `<img>` tags and extract the `src` attribute.\n\n5. **Linked Images**: An image can also be enclosed within a hyperlink, so the parser must be careful to extract the image file name and not the URL of the hyperlink if they are different.\n\n6. **Image Titles and Hover Text**: Besides alt text, images in Markdown can also have titles or hover text which are provided after the URL and separated by a space or a newline within the parentheses.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown files might use non-standard extensions to include images, which could vary by implementation and might require special handling.\n\n8. **Comments and Escape Characters**: Lastly, Markdown supports comments and escape characters which might hide or obscure image links.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, I would need to carefully parse the input file while accounting for these complexities in order to accurately extract all included image file names."
