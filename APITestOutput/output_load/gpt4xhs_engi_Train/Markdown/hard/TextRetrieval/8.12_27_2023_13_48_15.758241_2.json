The most common ones are `![Alt text](URL)` and `![Alt text][reference]`, where `reference` links to a URL defined elsewhere in the document. Ensuring that the parser recognizes all variations is necessary for accurate extraction.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be both relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs. The parser should be able to distinguish and extract both types.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: In some cases, images might be embedded using HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax (`<img src=\"URL\" alt=\"Alt text\">`). The parser should be able to handle this scenario as well.\n\n4. **Image References**: Markdown allows defining an image reference at any place in the document which is later referenced by an identifier. Accounting for these and extracting the correct URL is essential.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes image syntax might be escaped (like `\\!\\[Alt text](URL)`) to prevent it from being rendered as an image. Such cases should not be treated as actual images.\n\n6. **Links containing images**: Sometimes an image is also a link, and the parser may need to distinguish between extracting the image URL versus the link URL.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown elements**: There may be nested Markdown elements within the image's alt text or around the image syntax that complicate parsing.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Text that looks like image syntax but isn't (for example, due to typos or unconventional uses of brackets and parentheses) can lead to false positives.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties allows us to create a parser that is more robust and able to handle a variety of Markdown documents."
