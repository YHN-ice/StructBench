The most common way is the inline image syntax `![Alt text](URL)`, but there could be others, such as reference-style images.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: Image file paths can be complex and may include relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs. They may also have parameters appended which need to be ignored when extracting the file name.\n\n3. **Nested Markdown**: Sometimes images are included within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes. Ensuring that the image syntax is correctly identified within these nested elements is important.\n\n4. **Alt Text Similarity**: The alternative text for an image might sometimes look like a file name, so it's vital to correctly distinguish between alt text and the actual file path or URL.\n\n5. **Non-standard Extensions**: While the most common image file extensions are `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., there might be non-standard or less common extensions that should also be considered.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: In some cases, URLs or paths may include escape characters that need to be accounted for while extracting the file names.\n\n7. **Markdown Variants**: There are different variants of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and each might have slight differences in how images are embedded.\n\n8. **Image Links**: Sometimes images are also links, where the image syntax is nested inside link syntax. It's important not to confuse the URL of the image with the URL of the link.\n\nUnderstanding these difficulties will help in creating a robust parser that can accurately extract all included image files from a given Markdown file."
