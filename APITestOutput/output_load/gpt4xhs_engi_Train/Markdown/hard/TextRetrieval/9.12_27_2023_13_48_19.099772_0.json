The parser needs to recognize all possible syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can contain other Markdown elements inside it, such as links (`[link](url)`), italics (`*italic*`), code (`\\`code\\``), etc. The parser must handle these nested elements properly without confusing them with the bold syntax itself.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape the bold syntax markers (e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`) to prevent them from being parsed as bold. The parser needs to recognize and ignore escaped markers.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: In some cases, the bold markers might not be properly paired (e.g., `**bold`). The parser must decide how to handle these instances - whether to ignore them or attempt to find the best possible match.\n\n5. **Cross-paragraph Bold**: A user might mistakenly start bold text in one paragraph and end it in another (e.g., `**bold across\\n\\nparagraphs**`). The parser needs to handle multi-line bold text correctly.\n\n6. **Whitespace Handling**: There might be whitespace immediately after the opening or before the closing bold markers that could complicate the parsing (e.g., `** bold **`). The parser must trim these spaces to extract the text correctly.\n\n7. **Inline Code Blocks**: Bold markers within inline code blocks should not be treated as bold (e.g., `` `**not bold**` ``). The parser should detect and ignore bold syntax within code blocks.\n\nTo circumvent these issues, a robust Markdown parser will need a well-thought-out strategy, likely involving regular expressions or a parsing library that can handle Markdown's syntax and edge cases appropriately."
