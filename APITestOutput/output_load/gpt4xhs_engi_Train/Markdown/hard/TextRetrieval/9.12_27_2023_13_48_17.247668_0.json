The most common is using two asterisks `**` or two underscores `__` before and after the text. However, some platforms like GitHub also support a single asterisk `*` or underscore `_` for bolding when it's enabled in their specific version of Markdown.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, links, or inline code blocks. This can complicate the parsing as we have to ignore formatting inside code blocks and handle nested elements properly.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes, the asterisks or underscores meant for bold formatting might be escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold text\\**`), which means they should not be treated as formatting but as literal characters.\n\n4. **Inconsistent use of spaces:** Some users might put spaces between the asterisks and the text (e.g., `** bold text **`), which could cause parsing issues depending on how strict the parser is.\n\n5. **Links and Images:** Text within link labels or alt text for images might also use bold formatting, which might require special handling to avoid extracting non-relevant parts of a link or image syntax.\n\n6. **Cross-paragraph and cross-line formatting:** Bold formatting that spans multiple paragraphs or lines can create complexity in parsing, as it breaks the usual line-by-line parsing logic.\n\n7. **Invalid Formatting:** Users might incorrectly use the Markdown syntax leading to malformed structures that are intended to be bold but don't comply with the rules (e.g., `***text`, `**text*`, etc.).\n\nIdentifying and correctly handling these scenarios will be key to accurately extracting all bold texts from the Markdown file."
