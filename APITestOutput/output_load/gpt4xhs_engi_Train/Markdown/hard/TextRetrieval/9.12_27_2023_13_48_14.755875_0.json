In standard Markdown, bold text is typically surrounded by two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__). Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise:\n\n1. **Variations in Markdown Flavors:**\n   Different Markdown flavors might use slightly different syntax for bold text, such as a single asterisk or underscore, or even different characters altogether.\n\n2. **Ambiguity with Italics:**\n   In Markdown, a single asterisk (*) or underscore (_) is often used for italics. The parser must distinguish between single and double marks to correctly extract bold text without including italicized text.\n\n3. **Nested Emphasis:**\n   Bold and italic text can be nested within each other. For example, **This is _really_ important** might occur, which would require the parser to correctly handle both the bold and the italicized text within the same line.\n\n4. **Escaping Characters:**\n   Asterisks and underscores could be part of the actual content and not markup if they are preceded by a backslash (\\), known as escaping. These should not be treated as bold markers.\n\n5. **Incorrect Markdown Syntax:**\n   Users might make mistakes in their Markdown syntax, such as mismatched asterisks or underscores, which can make it difficult to determine intent.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:**\n   Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented with four spaces) and inline code (surrounded by backticks `) should not be parsed for markdown formatting like bold or italics.\n\n7. **Links, Images, and Other Formatting:**\n   Bold syntax might be used within links or image alt text. The parser has to decide whether to treat these as bold text or not.\n\nEach of these potential issues would require specific parsing rules to address. Once these rules are set and we have access to the input file, we can then proceed to parse the file and extract the bold texts accordingly."
