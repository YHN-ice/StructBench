It is important to account for these variations when extracting image filenames.\n   \n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in Markdown can be linked using relative paths or absolute URLs. While absolute URLs are straightforward, relative paths may require additional context to resolve to actual file locations.\n\n3. **Link References**: Sometimes images in Markdown are not directly included but are referenced using link reference definitions, e.g., `![Alt text][id]` and elsewhere in the document `[id]: URL`. Extracting such image filenames involves finding and resolving these references.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown may contain raw HTML tags, including `<img>` tags with `src` attributes that point to image files. This requires parsing HTML within the Markdown.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: The URLs for some images may be URL-encoded, and the parser will need to decode these URLs to get the correct filename.\n\n6. **Complex URLs**: Image URLs might include query parameters or fragments which are not part of the file name.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax may include escaped characters within paths that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n8. **Non-image File Links**: Other types of files might also be linked within the Markdown, and the parser must differentiate between image files and other file types.\n\n9. **Markdown Extensions**: There are various Markdown extensions that might change how images are included or referenced in a document.\n\n10. **Nested Content**: Image links could be nested within other Markdown elements, which adds complexity to the extraction process.\n\nLet's proceed with your input, and I'll do my best to extract all included image filenames while considering these potential difficulties."
