We would need to make sure our parser can recognize all these forms.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting markup such as links, italics, strikethroughs, or even other bold tags. We must ensure that our parser can handle these nested scenarios without breaking the structure.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the asterisks or underscores may be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they are not meant to format the text as bold. We should make sure these are not mistakenly extracted as bold text.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There could be false positives, such as a series of asterisks or underscores that are not intended to denote bold text (e.g., in a bullet list or horizontal line) that we must avoid extracting.\n\n5. **Inconsistencies in Markdown Flavors**: Different Markdown flavors (e.g., GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.) may have slight differences in how they interpret bold syntax. Our parser should ideally be aware of these differences.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown allows for bold text to span across multiple lines. The parser must be able to handle multiline patterns without terminating at line breaks.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks and inline code should not be treated as formatted text, so we need to ensure that our parser does not extract bold text from within code syntax.\n\n8. **Link Descriptions**: Sometimes, bold text might be part of the link description, which adds complexity in distinguishing between the actual link and the bold text within the markdown.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, our parser will need to carefully handle each of these situations without overgeneralizing or oversimplifying the patterns. Now please provide the input file so I can attempt to extract the bold texts accordingly."
