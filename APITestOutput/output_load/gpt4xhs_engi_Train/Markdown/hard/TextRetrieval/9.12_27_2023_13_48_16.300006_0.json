However, there might be variations in different Markdown flavors that could affect how bold is indicated.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might also contain other formatting within it, such as italic, strikethrough, or inline code. Parsing the bold text while preserving or ignoring nested formatting might be a challenge.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Asterisks or underscores used to indicate bold formatting might be escaped within the text (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they should not be treated as formatting and should be considered as part of the text instead.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting:** Sometimes formatting markers might be unmatched or incomplete (e.g., `**bold` without a closing `**`). Deciding how to handle these cases could be an issue.\n\n5. **Adjacent Formatting:** There may be cases where formatting syntax is adjacent to other characters without spacing (e.g., `text**bold**text`), which could complicate the parsing process.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text:** Bold text may span multiple lines, which would mean that a parser needs to consider line breaks within bold formatting.\n\nPlease provide the Markdown input file, and let's start parsing to extract the bold text."
