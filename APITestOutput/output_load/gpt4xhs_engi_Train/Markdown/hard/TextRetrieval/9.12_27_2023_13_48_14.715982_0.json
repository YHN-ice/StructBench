Inconsistent Formatting: If the bold syntax is not used consistently (e.g., missing one asterisk or one underscore), it could be difficult to identify bold text.\n\n2. Inline Code or Code Blocks: Bold markers within inline code (denoted by backticks `) or code blocks should not be interpreted as bold text.\n\n3. Nested Formatting: Bold syntax inside other formatting elements like links, images, italicized text, or strikethroughs might complicate extraction.\n\n4. Escaped Characters: Asterisks or underscores that are preceded by a backslash should be treated as literal characters, not as formatting.\n\n5. False Positives: Asterisks or underscores used in a context other than for bold formatting (e.g., in a list or as part of a mathematical formula) could lead to incorrect extraction.\n\n6. Multiline Bold Text: Bold text that spans multiple lines could be tricky if the parser does not handle multiline patterns well.\n\n7. Overlapping Formatting: Situations where bold formatting overlaps with other formatting (e.g., bold within italic) might need special handling.\n\n8. Non-standard Markdown Extensions: Some Markdown processors support extensions that modify the standard behavior; if such extensions are used, they could affect how bold text should be parsed.\n\nI will need to see the input file to address these challenges and extract the bold texts accurately."
