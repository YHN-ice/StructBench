It's important to account for both possibilities.\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements, such as links (`[**bold text**](URL)`) or italicized phrases (`*italic **bold** text*`). Ensuring proper extraction of bold text within these contexts could be challenging.\n3. **False positives:** Text that includes asterisks or underscores but is not meant to represent bold formatting (e.g., `This is not **bold** text.`) should not be considered as bold.\n4. **Escaped characters:** Sometimes, asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), meaning they are not intended to format the text as bold. These instances should not be treated as bold text.\n5. **Incomplete formatting:** Instances where the formatting syntax is started but not properly closed (e.g., `**bold` without a closing `**`), which might be considered a mistake in the document.\n6. **Code blocks and inline code:** Bold syntax within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or four spaces indentation) or inline code (indicated by single backticks `) should not be treated as formatting but as literal text.\n7. **Multiline bold text:** Bold text that spans multiple lines may not always be correctly formatted or recognized by parsers that expect inline styles to be contained within a single line.\n\nThese are some of the complexities that need to be considered when parsing Markdown to extract bold texts.
