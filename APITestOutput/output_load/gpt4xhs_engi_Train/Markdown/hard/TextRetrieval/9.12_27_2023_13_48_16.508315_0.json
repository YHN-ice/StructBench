Using two underscores before and after the text: `__bold text__`\n\nSome potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the extraction process include:\n\n1. **Nested emphasis**: Bold text might contain other formatting within it, like italicized words (e.g., `**bold _and italics_ text**`), which we need to account for when extracting just the bold text.\n2. **Escape characters**: If asterisks or underscores are preceded by backslashes, they are typically meant to be displayed as literal characters rather than as formatting (e.g., `\\**not bold**` should not be interpreted as bold).\n3. **Incorrect formatting**: There may be instances where the Markdown syntax is used incorrectly (e.g., `**bold**text` without proper spacing), which could cause issues when trying to parse these instances correctly.\n4. **Text in code blocks or inline code**: Bold syntax within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks `` ``` `` or indented by four spaces) or inline code (enclosed by single backticks `` ` ``) should not be interpreted as bold since those are meant to display raw text.\n5. **Links or images**: Text associated with links or images may use asterisks or underscores, but they may not necessarily represent bold text (e.g., `[link text](url)` or `![alt text](image_url)`).\n\nTo provide accurate extractions, the parser needs to handle these scenarios correctly and ensure that it only extracts text that is intentionally formatted as bold by the author of the Markdown file."
