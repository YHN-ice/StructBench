Some documents might use one, the other, or both, so it's important to account for both possibilities.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like links, italicized text, or even within code blocks. Depending on the requirements, you might need to handle this nested content differently.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped within the text, which means they are not meant to format the text but to be displayed as literal characters. Detecting escaped characters and not interpreting them as formatting is necessary.\n\n4. **Partial formatting**: There might be cases where the formatting is not properly closed, such as a single asterisk or underscore without its closing pair. Deciding how to handle these cases (ignore, partial extraction, etc.) could be challenging.\n\n5. **In-line code blocks**: Bold text might appear within inline code blocks, denoted by backticks ` `. Typically, you would ignore formatting within code blocks, as they are meant to display raw text.\n\n6. **Block-level elements**: Bold text might also be part of other block-level elements like headers, lists, blockquotes, etc. The parser needs to be able to handle and recognize bold text within these different contexts.\n\n7. **Links and images**: Bold syntax may appear within the text of links or alt text of images. The parser would need to correctly extract the bold text without including the surrounding link or image syntax.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties and obstacles, let's proceed with extracting the bold texts from the given input file when provided."
