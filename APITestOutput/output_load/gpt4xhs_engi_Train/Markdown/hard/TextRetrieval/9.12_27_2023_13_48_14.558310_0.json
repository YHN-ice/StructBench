The parser must recognize both formats.\n\n2. **Nested elements**: Bold syntax can contain other Markdown elements like italics, code, or even links. The parser would need to ignore the formatting of these nested elements when extracting the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores could be escaped within the text (`\\**not bold\\**`), which means they are not intended to format the text but to be displayed as literal characters. The parser must differentiate between escaped and unescaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting**: If the Markdown contains errors where the bold syntax is not properly closed (`**bold text`), this could lead to parsing issues.\n\n5. **Line breaks and spaces**: Bold text can span across multiple lines or contain leading/trailing spaces that should be trimmed (`** bold text **`).\n\n6. **Ambiguity with list items**: An asterisk is also used to denote list items in Markdown, so the parser must distinguish between list syntax and bold formatting.\n\n7. **Adjacent bold sections**: Two bold sections might be adjacent to each other with or without spaces in between, which should be considered as separate instances (`**bold1****bold2**`).\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a careful parsing strategy that respects the Markdown syntax while accurately identifying and extracting the bold text content."
