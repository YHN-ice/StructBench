I'll need to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might include other formatting like italics, code spans, links, or images. It's important to only extract the text that is bold, without including the markup for nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows for escaping characters that would otherwise be interpreted as formatting. For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be treated as bold text.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Formatted Text**: If the Markdown is incorrectly written (e.g., missing a closing asterisk), it may lead to difficulty in determining where the bold text actually starts and ends.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Paragraphs**: Bold text might span across multiple lines or paragraphs, so the parser must be able to handle multiline formatting correctly.\n\n6. **Contextual Interpretation**: Depending on the context, the same sequence of characters might not always represent bold text. For example, asterisks could be used in a list.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Punctuation**: Punctuation marks immediately following the closing asterisks or underscores can sometimes confuse parsers as to whether they are part of the bold text or separate from it.\n\n8. **Performance and Efficiency**: If the Markdown file is large with many instances of bold text, the parser must be efficient enough to handle large inputs without significant performance degradation.\n\nGiven these potential issues, an accurate parser needs to account for all these cases to reliably extract bold texts from a Markdown file."
