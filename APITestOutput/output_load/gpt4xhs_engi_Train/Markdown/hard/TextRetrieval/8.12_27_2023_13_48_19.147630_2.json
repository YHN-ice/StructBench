Extracting image files from a Markdown document can come with the following challenges:\n\n1. **Variety of syntax**: Markdown supports multiple ways to include images, primarily using the `![Alt text](URL)` format. However, variations may include different placements of spaces, alt text, titles within the link, or even reference-style image links.\n\n2. **Relative and absolute paths**: Images can be included using both relative paths (e.g., `./images/picture.jpg`) and absolute URLs (e.g., `http://example.com/image.png`). A parser needs to handle both scenarios.\n\n3. **Encoded URLs and spaces**: URLs within Markdown may be percent-encoded, or spaces might be escaped, which means the parser must decode them to extract the actual file name.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files may also contain raw HTML with `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax for images.\n\n5. **Link references**: Some Markdown documents use reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. **Nested content**: Image links might be nested within other elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, requiring a context-aware parsing to avoid misinterpretation of the syntax.\n\n7. **Non-image URLs**: Not all URLs will point to an image file (e.g., they might link to a webpage). We need to differentiate between these and actual image files.\n\n8. **False positives**: Sometimes text might appear similar to image syntax but isn't an actual image link (e.g., an incorrect syntax or a code block example).\n\n9. **File extensions**: Common image file extensions (like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) need to be recognized, but there could also be less common ones.\n\n10. **Escape characters**: Markdown allows escape characters to prevent certain characters from being interpreted as Markdown syntax, which could affect the parsing of image names.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties helps us approach the problem methodically and ensure that our parser accounts for these possible obstacles. Now, if you could provide the Markdown file, I can assist with parsing out the image filenames."
