Handling both correctly is important.\n\n2. **Image URLs vs. File Names**: Images can be linked directly via URLs or by referencing local file paths. We need to differentiate between the two and only extract the local file names if that's what is requested.\n\n3. **Alt Text Confusion**: Sometimes, the alt text of an image might contain parentheses or brackets, which can confuse a simple parser that only looks for text within parentheses or brackets to find image URLs.\n\n4. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which might require additional parsing logic to handle correctly.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown syntax may include escaped characters that a parser must identify and handle properly to avoid false positives or negatives.\n\n6. **Links vs. Images**: Markdown uses similar syntax for links and images; it's important to distinguish between the two to ensure only images are extracted.\n\n7. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be referenced using both relative and absolute paths, and the parser needs to handle both appropriately.\n\n8. **Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown files may use extensions or variations of the standard Markdown syntax, which may affect how images are included in the document.\n\nConsidering these challenges, we'll need to be careful when parsing the input file so that we accurately extract only the image file names."
