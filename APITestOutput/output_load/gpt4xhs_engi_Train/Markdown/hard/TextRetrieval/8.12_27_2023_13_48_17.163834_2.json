However, variations like reference-style links or HTML `<img>` tags embedded within the Markdown might also be used.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Images can be linked using relative paths (e.g., `./image.png`) or absolute paths (e.g., `https://example.com/image.png`). The parser must differentiate between paths to extract only file names.\n\n3. **Images Linked Within Text:** An image link might be included within text or even within a link, which may make it harder to identify without proper regular expression handling or parsing logic.\n\n4. **Multiple Images on a Single Line:** There could be multiple images on the same line, so the parser needs to handle this without skipping any images.\n\n5. **Complex Filenames:** Filenames might include spaces, special characters, or extensions other than typical image formats like .jpg or .png.\n\n6. **Non-Image Files:** Markdown might link to non-image files (like `.pdf` or `.docx`), and the parser must filter these out if only image file names are required.\n\n7. **Alt Text Confusion:** The alternative text for an image might contain parentheses or brackets which could confuse a simple parser that does not account for this.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, an effective parser needs a robust way to accurately identify image syntax, handle various path types, and filter out non-image links while also managing complex filenames and inline images. Regular expressions or a dedicated Markdown parsing library may be necessary to accurately process and extract the image file names."
