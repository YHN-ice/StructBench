Ensuring that all variations are accounted for can be challenging.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Markdown files can also contain inline HTML tags, such as `<img src=\"image_path\" alt=\"alt text\" />`. A parser must be able to recognize these tags as well.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute paths**: Images can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. It's important to account for both when listing image file names.\n\n4. **Link vs. Image confusion**: Sometimes links (`[link text](url)`) can be mistaken for images if the parser isn't careful to distinguish between them based on the presence of an exclamation mark before the brackets.\n\n5. **Nested content**: Images could be nested inside other elements like lists or blockquotes, which may complicate the parsing process.\n\n6. **Escaped characters**: If the Markdown syntax for an image is escaped (like `\\![alt text](image_path)`), it's not meant to be an actual image, but rather a textual representation of the image syntax.\n\n7. **File names with spaces or special characters**: File names in the Markdown source may contain spaces or special characters that need to be handled correctly.\n\n8. **Broken syntax**: Incomplete or incorrectly formatted image syntax could lead to incorrect extraction if not properly detected.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these challenges will help in accurately extracting all included image file names from the Markdown file. Now, please provide the Markdown input so we can proceed with the extraction."
