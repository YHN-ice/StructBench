I must be able to extract the bold text without including formatting from nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape the bold syntax with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which should not be treated as bold.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Some Markdown editors might support variations in syntax, like having spaces between the asterisks and the text (`** text **`), or mismatched pairs of asterisks and underscores for bold formatting (e.g., `**text__`). The parser must decide how strictly to interpret these cases.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Bold syntax within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) or inline code (surrounded by backticks `) should not be interpreted as bold since they are meant for code representation.\n\n6. **Partial Overlaps**: There might be overlaps, where only part of a text is marked as bold, such as `This is **bold and _italic_** text`. The parser needs to correctly extract only the bold part without the italic formatting.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: Markdown syntax may span multiple lines. The parser needs to handle situations where the bold syntax starts on one line and ends on another.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser must account for these potential issues and apply logic that aligns with the standard Markdown specifications."
