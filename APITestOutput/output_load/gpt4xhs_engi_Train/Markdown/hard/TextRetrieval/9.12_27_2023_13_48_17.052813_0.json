I need to look for both patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Bold within Other Elements**: Bold text might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or headers, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **In-line Code Blocks or Code Fences**: Text within inline code blocks (surrounded by backticks `` ` ``) or code fences (triple backticks ``` ``` ```) should not be treated as bold even if they contain double asterisks or underscores.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape asterisks or underscores (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`) to display them as literals instead of using them to format text. These instances should not be treated as bold.\n\n5. **Links with Bold Text**: A link description could contain bold text, which might have additional square brackets and parentheses to consider.\n\n6. **Incomplete Markdown Formatting**: Sometimes the markdown formatting is not completed properly (e.g., `**bold` without a closing `**`), which should not be treated as bold.\n\n7. **Line Breaks within Bold Text**: There might be line breaks within bold text that need to be handled correctly.\n\n8. **Bold Italic Text**: Text can be both bold and italic if surrounded by three asterisks or underscores (e.g., `***bold and italic***`). The parser needs to identify and handle these cases appropriately.\n\n9. **Overlapping Formats**: There might be overlapping formatting where bold text starts inside italic text and ends outside, or vice versa (e.g., `*italic **bold* text**`), which could complicate extraction.\n\nAddressing these issues requires careful parsing of the Markdown file to ensure that only the correct bold texts are extracted accurately. Now you can present the input file, and I will attempt to extract the bold texts considering these potential difficulties."
