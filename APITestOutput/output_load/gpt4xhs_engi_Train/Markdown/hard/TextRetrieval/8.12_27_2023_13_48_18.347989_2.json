Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise:\n\n1. **Variations in Image Syntax**: Markdown supports images with a syntax like `![alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but variations can occur, such as:\n   - Different spacing, e.g., `! [alt text] (URL \"Title\")`.\n   - Omission of optional elements like alt text or title, e.g., `![](URL)` or `![](URL \"Title\")`.\n   - Use of reference-style links where the URL is not inline, e.g., `![alt text][reference]`.\n\n2. **Image URLs vs File Names**: The `URL` part in the image syntax may be an actual URL to an image hosted online or a file path to an image file. Only file paths should be extracted if we're interested in image files included in the Markdown.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image file paths can be relative or absolute. For instance, `./image.png` or `/images/image.png`. Depending on what's needed, handling different paths may require different approaches.\n\n4. **Markdown Characters in File Names**: If a file name contains characters used by Markdown syntax (like parentheses or brackets), it may require special handling to be correctly parsed.\n\n5. **Non-Image Files**: Links to non-image files may also be included with similar syntax, so ensuring only image files are extracted (perhaps by checking file extensions) is important.\n\n6. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown also allows embedding raw HTML, so images included with `<img>` tags might also need to be extracted.\n\n7. **Link Definitions**: Markdown supports defining link references separately from where they're used. Extracting images might require resolving these link references.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Escaped characters in the Markdown could complicate parsing, especially if they are part of the image syntax.\n\nAddressing these difficulties would require a careful and potentially complex parsing strategy to ensure all image files are extracted accurately."
