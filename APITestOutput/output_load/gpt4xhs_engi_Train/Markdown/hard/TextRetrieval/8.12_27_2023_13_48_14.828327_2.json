Handling these differences and identifying image file names might require different approaches.\n\n3. **Reference-style image links**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links where the URL reference is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document. Recognizing and resolving these references might be necessary.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes images are embedded using raw HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax within a Markdown file. This could complicate extraction as we will need to parse HTML as well.\n\n5. **Non-image files**: Ensuring that the extracted URLs or paths actually point to image files and not other file types.\n\n6. **Link text confusion**: The alt text of the image or the surrounding text might contain patterns that resemble Markdown image syntax, leading to false positives.\n\n7. **Escaped image syntax**: Markdown allows escaping of special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting commands. This could lead to mistakenly identifying escaped image syntax as real ones.\n\n8. **Nested content**: Occasionally, Markdown files might have nested content or other formatting within the image's alt text, making it trickier to parse out just the image links.\n\nDepending on the actual contents of the provided Markdown file, some or all of these issues might come into play when trying to correctly extract all included image files."
