This variability can make it difficult to write a universal parser.\n  \n2. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes image syntax might be escaped to prevent it from being rendered as an image, which means the parser has to be smart enough not to count those as actual images.\n\n3. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be nested within other elements, like links or blockquotes, which might make the parsing process more complex.\n\n4. **Incomplete or Incorrect Syntax**: If the Markdown is not correctly formatted (missing brackets, parentheses, etc.), it might be difficult for the parser to correctly identify and extract image file names.\n\n5. **Alternative Text Complexity**: The alternative text for images (the text between the square brackets `[ ]`) can sometimes include characters that make it hard to differentiate from actual syntax, such as parentheses or additional brackets.\n\n6. **URLs with Parameters**: Image URLs may come with query parameters or anchors, which need to be handled correctly as they are part of the URL but not typically part of the file name.\n\n7. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: The parser needs to account for both relative and absolute paths to images.\n\n8. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Some Markdown files might have images embedded directly using Base64 encoding rather than linking to a file, which a parser looking for file names would need to ignore.\n\n9. **Non-standard Extensions**: Image files might use non-standard file extensions, making it harder to filter them if relying on a list of known image extensions.\n\n10. **Hosted Images**: Some images might be hosted on external services, and their URLs can take various forms that may not obviously denote them as images without knowledge of the domain.\n\nTo effectively overcome these challenges, a Markdown parser should ideally have logic in place to handle various cases, use regular expressions or similar mechanisms to identify image syntax, and robustly handle edge cases and errors that could occur in real-world Markdown files."
