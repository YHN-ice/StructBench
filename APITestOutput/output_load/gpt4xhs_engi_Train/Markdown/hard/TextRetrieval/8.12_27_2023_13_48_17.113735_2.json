I need to be able to recognize both formats and any variations of these.\n\n2. **Image URLs vs File Names**: The Markdown might contain URLs pointing to online resources or relative paths to image files in the filesystem. I need to distinguish between URLs and file names and extract only the latter.\n\n3. **Incomplete or Incorrect Markup**: Sometimes, the Markdown could be incorrectly formatted, or the image links could be broken with missing parentheses or brackets. Detecting and handling such cases is necessary so that the parser doesn't mistake parts of the text for image file names.\n\n4. **Handling Escape Characters**: Markdown uses backslashes to escape characters that might otherwise have special meaning. This can affect how image syntax is interpreted.\n\n5. **Alternative Text**: Markdown images include alternative text, which is not part of the file name but could be mistaken for one if not correctly parsed.\n\n6. **Nested Content**: Images may be included within other structures, such as lists or blockquotes, and ensuring that these contexts don't confuse the parsing is important.\n\n7. **File Path Variations**: Images might be included with a variety of file paths, like absolute paths, relative paths with different levels (e.g., `./image.png`, `../image.png`, `/images/image.png`), and it’s required to correctly parse these paths to extract the file name.\n\n8. **Image File Extensions**: There are multiple image file extensions (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg`, etc.). The parser must recognize all possible valid image file extensions when extracting the names.\n\nOnce we have the input file, I'll apply parsing logic to identify and extract the image file names accordingly, keeping these potential challenges in mind."
