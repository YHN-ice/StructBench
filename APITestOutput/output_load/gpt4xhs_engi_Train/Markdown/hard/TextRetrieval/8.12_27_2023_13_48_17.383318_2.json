However, variations might exist, such as omitting the alt text or title, using reference-style links, or even linking to an image hosted on a server that requires authentication.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in a Markdown file can be linked using either relative or absolute paths. Differentiating between these types and transforming relative paths to something meaningful outside the context of the Markdown file might be challenging.\n\n3. **Embedded Images (Base64 Encoded)**: Sometimes, images in Markdown files are embedded directly using Base64 encoding. Extracting the filename of such images might not be straightforward since they don't necessarily have a traditional file path or name.\n\n4. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support non-standard extensions that allow for more complex image handling, such as resizing or adding classes. These might complicate the parsing process.\n\n5. **Markdown Variants**: There are various flavors of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and they may have slight differences in how they handle images.\n\n6. **Distraction with Link Syntax**: The link syntax in Markdown is similar to the image syntax but without the exclamation mark at the beginning (`[Link text](URL \"Title\")`). It's important not to confuse these with image syntax when parsing.\n\n7. **Complex Document Structure**: Markdown documents can contain nested structures like lists, block quotes, or code blocks where the image syntax could be present but should not be treated as an actual image tag based on the context.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be designed to handle various scenarios while extracting the correct filenames of the images included in the Markdown file."
