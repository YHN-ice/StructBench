For example, an image hosted on the web would have an absolute URL, while an image within a project might use a relative path.\n\n3. **Handling Alt Text and Titles**: Images in Markdown can have alt text and title attributes, which are optional and need to be separated from the actual file name.\n\n4. **Link References**: Markdown allows for link references where the image source isn't directly in the image tag but rather referenced elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might embed HTML for more complex image handling, which can include `<img>` tags with various attributes.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There may be text within the document that resembles Markdown image syntax but isn't an image, such as commented-out sections or examples of Markdown syntax within code blocks.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Some characters in URLs or alt text might be escaped and need to be unescaped to extract the correct file name.\n\n8. **Different Platforms**: The way file paths are written can vary between operating systems, which may affect how paths need to be parsed.\n\nIdentifying and correctly handling these scenarios will be necessary to accurately extract all included image file names from the given Markdown file."
