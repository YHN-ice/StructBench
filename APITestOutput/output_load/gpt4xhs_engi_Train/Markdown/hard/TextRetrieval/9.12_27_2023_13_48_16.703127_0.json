The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like links (`[link](url)`) or italicized text (`*italic*` or `_italic_`). The parser needs to correctly extract bold text without including the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to indicate they are not formatting (e.g., `\\**not bold**\\`). The parser should not consider these as bold.\n\n4. **Incomplete markers**: There might be instances where the bold markers are not correctly paired, such as `**bold` without a closing `**`. Deciding how to handle these cases can be tricky.\n\n5. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or indented with four spaces) or inline code (indicated by single backticks `) should not be parsed as bold, even if they contain bold markers.\n\n6. **Lists and headers**: Bold text might appear within list items or headers, which could pose additional parsing challenges.\n\n7. **Line breaks and whitespace**: The parser needs to manage line breaks and whitespace correctly to ensure that only the bold text is extracted without additional formatting or whitespace.\n\n8. **Overlapping formatting**: Bold text might overlap with other formatting, such as strikethrough or blockquotes. The parser must correctly handle these cases.\n\nEach of these could complicate the process of extracting only the raw bold text from a Markdown file."
