Some might use reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the alt text.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths:** Image paths could be relative to the location of the Markdown file or absolute paths (including URLs). This could affect how we identify and extract file names.\n\n3. **Images in HTML tags:** Some Markdown files may include HTML directly, and images could be embedded using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Handling escape characters:** Sometimes, characters in Markdown are escaped with a backslash, which could complicate the parsing of image filenames.\n\n5. **Nested parentheses and brackets:** If the alt text or title includes parentheses or brackets, it might throw off a simple parsing algorithm.\n\n6. **Comments and other non-visible text:** Sometimes, images could be included in comments or other non-visible sections of a Markdown file, which we may or may not want to ignore depending on the requirements.\n\n7. **Links within code blocks or inline code:** If an image link is enclosed within a code block or inline code syntax, it should not be treated as an actual image link to extract.\n\nFor each of these potential obstacles, we would need to create rules or use regular expressions carefully crafted to handle these cases properly when parsing the file."
