Here are a few potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when extracting image file names from a Markdown file:\n\n1. **Syntax Variations**: Markdown supports different syntaxes for embedding images. The most common is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there might be variations or shortcuts used in some Markdown flavors.\n\n2. **Reference-Style Links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but rather defined elsewhere in the document. This could complicate the extraction of image file names.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Markdown supports inline HTML, so images could be embedded using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links could be either relative or absolute paths, and parsing those paths correctly is necessary to extract just the file name.\n\n5. **URLs with Parameters**: Some image URLs may have query parameters or anchors attached which are not part of the file name.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Characters within the Markdown file could be escaped, which would need to be accounted for when parsing.\n\n7. **Linked vs. Embedded Images**: Markdown files might link to images (without displaying them) or actually embed them for display. It's important to differentiate between the two if only embedded images are of interest.\n\n8. **Non-image Files**: Other types of files could also be linked within a Markdown file, so it's essential to ensure that only image files are being extracted.\n\n9. **Multiple Images on One Line**: Multiple images might be present on a single line, so the parser must be able to handle this scenario.\n\n10. **Incorrect Markdown Syntax**: Sometimes, Markdown files might contain errors or non-standard syntax which could make it difficult to parse with a standard approach.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I'll apply the necessary logic to handle these potential challenges and extract the names of all included image files."
