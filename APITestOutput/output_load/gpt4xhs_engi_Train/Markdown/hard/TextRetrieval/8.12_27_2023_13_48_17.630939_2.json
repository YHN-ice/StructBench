The standard syntax is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but sometimes the URL may be in reference style where the link is defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n2. **Complex URLs**: Some image URLs might be complex, containing query parameters or fragments which are not part of the file name.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Image files can have various extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.). The parser needs to recognize and extract these correctly.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters or Markdown Extensions**: If the Markdown uses backslashes to escape characters or has extensions like HTML tags or custom markdown extensions, the parser must handle these correctly.\n\n5. **Relative vs. Absolute URLs**: Image sources can be specified with relative or absolute paths. The parser should identify the file name irrespective of the path type.\n\n6. **Inline HTML Images**: Some Markdown files might include images through inline HTML rather than Markdown syntax. A robust parser should account for this too.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line, so the parser must be able to handle and extract multiple file names from a single line.\n\n8. **Image References Without File Extensions**: Occasionally, images may be referenced without an explicit file extension, relying on server-side mechanisms to serve the correct file. The parser should handle this scenario appropriately.\n\n9. **Non-image Files**: The parser must distinguish between image files and other types of files that may also be linked within the Markdown.\n\nOnce you provide the input file, I can start parsing the content and list the image file names as required."
