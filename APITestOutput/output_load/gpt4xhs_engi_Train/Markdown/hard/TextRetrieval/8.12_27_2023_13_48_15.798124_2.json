However, users might omit some parts, like the alt text or the title.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative to the document or absolute URLs. Extracting the file names from absolute URLs might require additional parsing to isolate the file name.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown supports embedding HTML directly. Images could also be included using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the alt text but is instead referenced at the bottom of the document or after the paragraph.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: If characters like `!` or `[]()` are escaped with a backslash in the Markdown, they should not be interpreted as image syntax.\n\n6. **Linked Images**: Sometimes images are also links, which adds another layer of syntax to parse.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Common image file extensions include `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, and `.svg`, but there can be others, and they could be case-sensitive.\n\n8. **Line Breaks**: Markdown parsers should be able to handle images defined with breaks in the syntax due to line wrapping or formatting choices.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser needs to be robust enough to handle a variety of scenarios while extracting image file names."
