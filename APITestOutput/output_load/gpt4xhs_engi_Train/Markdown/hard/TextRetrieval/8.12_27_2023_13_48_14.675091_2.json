Each type would require a different parsing approach.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML tags (e.g., `<img src=\"image-path\" />`). These would need to be accounted for separately from standard Markdown image syntax.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs. Extracting file names from URLs might require additional steps to clean and isolate the file name.\n\n4. **Image Links**: Confusion can arise if there are links that lead to images rather than images being embedded directly. These should not be confused with actual image embeds unless the objective is to extract all image references.\n\n5. **Text that Looks Like Markdown**: There may be examples or code blocks within the Markdown that demonstrate how to embed an image but aren't intended as actual images in the document.\n\n6. **Non-standard Markdown extensions**: Some Markdown flavors or extensions may alter the way images are embedded, possibly requiring specialized parsing logic.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Escaped characters preceding what would otherwise be image syntax could prevent proper recognition of an image line.\n\n8. **Variety of Image File Extensions**: Knowing which file extensions to look for (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) is necessary, though the list could be extensive and there could be newer or less common extensions.\n\n9. **Nested Content**: Images embedded within other elements, like lists or blockquotes, might present additional parsing challenges.\n\nTo accurately extract all included image files, the parser needs to robustly handle these situations and carefully identify lines that actually represent images in the document."
