The most common one is `![alt text](image-url \"Title\")`, but variations might exist that could complicate the parsing process.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image files in Markdown can be linked via both relative and absolute paths. Distinguishing between these and identifying the actual file names can be tricky, especially if the Markdown file uses a mix of both.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Markdown also supports inline HTML, so images could be included using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax. This would require the parser to handle HTML parsing as well.\n\n4. **Linked Images**: Sometimes images are not embedded directly but are linked, meaning the image file itself isn't included in the document but rather a URL to the image. In this case, understanding whether to provide the link or if there's a filename associated is important.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: Image URLs can sometimes be percent-encoded, especially if they contain spaces or special characters. Decoding these URLs might be necessary to extract the correct file names.\n\n6. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but is instead referenced elsewhere in the document. Identifying and correctly pairing these references can complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Non-standard Extensions or No Extensions**: Some images may have non-standard file extensions or no extension at all, making it less clear which pieces of text refer to image files.\n\n8. **Text that Looks Like Image Syntax**: There may be examples in the text that demonstrate how to use image syntax without linking to an actual file (e.g., in a tutorial about Markdown). Distinguishing these examples from actual images can be challenging.\n\nTo properly extract all included image files, we need to address these potential issues by implementing a robust parsing strategy that can handle various syntaxes and edge cases."
