The most common are double asterisks `**text**` or double underscores `__text__`. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Bold text can have other Markdown elements inside it, such as links `[text](url)`, code `code`, or italics `*text*`. The parser must be able to extract the bold text without including the syntax of nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape Markdown syntax using backslashes, like `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to recognize when the bold syntax is escaped and should not be treated as bold.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There could be instances where double asterisks or underscores do not indicate bold text, such as in code blocks, where they should be treated as literal characters.\n\n5. **Incomplete Syntax**: Sometimes users start bold syntax without closing it properly (e.g., `**bold`). The parser should decide how to handle these cases, whether to ignore them or process them as bold.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Some Markdown parsers allow for line breaks within bold syntax, while others do not. The handling of line breaks within bold text can affect the extraction process.\n\nGiven these challenges, the parser must be carefully designed to correctly identify and extract bold text within the constraints of Markdown syntax rules. Now I am ready to see the input file and extract the bold texts as requested."
