The parser must handle all variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested within other formatting elements like italics, links, or code blocks. The parser needs to be able to extract bold text without including unwanted formatting.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores could be used in the text for other purposes than formatting (e.g., to represent bullet points or horizontal rules). The parser has to differentiate between formatting and non-formating uses.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape formatting characters using a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). The parser must recognize escaped characters and not treat them as formatting.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting**: There may be cases where the formatting markers are unbalanced or incomplete (e.g., `**bold text`). The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown supports bold text that spans multiple lines. The parser should be able to handle multiline formatting properly.\n\n7. **Compatibility with Other Markdown Flavors**: Different Markdown processors may have slightly different rules for parsing bold text. The parser's behavior should be consistent with the most common Markdown specifications.\n\nGiven these challenges, the parser must be robust enough to handle various edge cases and ensure accurate extraction of all bold texts."
