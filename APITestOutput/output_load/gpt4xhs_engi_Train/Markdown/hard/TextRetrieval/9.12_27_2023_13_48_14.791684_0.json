I need to recognize both cases.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags such as links, italics, or strikethroughs, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. Escaped characters: Sometimes the bold syntax might be escaped to display the asterisks or underscores literally, rather than applying the bold formatting (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). These should not be confused with actual bold text.\n\n4. Inconsistent formatting: Not all Markdown files follow strict standards, and there might be inconsistencies or mistakes in how the bold syntax is applied.\n\n5. Multiline bold text: Bold text might span multiple lines, which would require multiline pattern matching.\n\n6. Overlapping formatting: There might be overlapping formatting that includes bold along with other styles (e.g., `***bold and italic***`), which would need to be handled to extract only the bold portion.\n\n7. Code blocks and inline code: Text within code blocks (denoted by triple backticks ```) or inline code (denoted by single backticks `) should not be considered as formatted text, even if they contain sequences that would otherwise indicate bold formatting.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser must account for these complexities and correctly apply the logic to differentiate genuine bold text from other similar patterns."
