Ensuring that all these cases are handled correctly could be challenging.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text can sometimes be nested within other elements like italic, strikethrough, or even within other bold tags. Parsing nested emphasis without losing context may be difficult.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are also used for other purposes in Markdown (like bullet lists or underscores within words), which could lead to false positives if not accounted for properly.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are escaped with a backslash (`\\`) should not be treated as markup for bold text. The parser needs to differentiate between escaped characters and actual markup.\n\n5. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (`` ` ``) should not be parsed for bold formatting, as it is meant to display exactly what's inside the backticks.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Similar to inline code blocks, larger code blocks (indented with spaces/tabs or surrounded by triple backticks \"```\") should be ignored when parsing for bold text.\n\n7. **Links and Images**: Markdown syntax for links and images may contain asterisks or underscores, and the parser must distinguish these from bold formatting.\n\n8. **Partial Matches**: There may be situations where the bold syntax is not properly closed (e.g., `**bold text` without the closing `**`). Deciding how to handle these cases is necessary—whether to ignore them or still consider them as bold text.\n\n9. **Contextual Differences**: Depending on the context, the same sequence of characters might need to be parsed differently. For example, asterisks in a mathematical expression should not be interpreted as bold formatting.\n\nAddressing these obstacles would involve implementing a robust parsing algorithm or using a library specifically designed for parsing Markdown that can handle all these edge cases correctly."
