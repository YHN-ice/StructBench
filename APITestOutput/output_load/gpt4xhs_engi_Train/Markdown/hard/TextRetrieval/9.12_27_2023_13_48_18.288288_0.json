We need to search for all possible patterns that represent bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text could be nested within other elements, such as links (`[**bold text**](URL)`), or italics combined with bold (`***italic and bold***`). Properly extracting bold text without the surrounding elements could be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows the escaping of special characters using a backslash `\\`. So, `**bold\\**text**` would not be considered bold text, while `**bold text**` would be. The parser needs to handle escaped characters correctly.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: There could be instances where the bold markers are not properly closed, such as `**bold text`. These should not be considered as bold text, depending on the strictness of the parser.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text inside code blocks and inline code should not be parsed as Markdown. So, anything within `` ` `` or fenced code blocks (```` ``` ````) should be ignored.\n\n6. **Lists, Blockquotes, and Other Elements**: Bold text can appear within lists, blockquotes, and other Markdown elements. The parser has to consider these contexts and still extract bold text accurately.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: In some Markdown interpreters, line breaks can affect the parsing of bold text. For instance, `**bold text` followed by a newline and then `more bold text**` might not be considered bold in every interpreter.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that may need to be addressed when attempting to extract all bold texts from a Markdown file. The parser must be able to handle these cases to provide accurate results."
