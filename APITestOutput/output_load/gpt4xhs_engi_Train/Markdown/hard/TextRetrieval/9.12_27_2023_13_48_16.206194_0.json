The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` and double underscores `__bold text__`. We need to account for both.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested within other elements like links `[**bold text**](URL)` or italics `**_bold and italic_**`. The parser must recognize bold text within such constructs.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might use escape characters to prevent Markdown from parsing asterisks or underscores as formatting, e.g. `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be counted as bold.\n\n4. **Partial Formatting**: There might be instances where the formatting is not properly closed, such as `**bold text`. Whether to include these partially formatted texts would depend on the parsing rules we decide to follow.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks using backticks ` or triple backticks ``` should not be formatted and thus shouldn't be recognized as bold, even if they contain double asterisks or underscores.\n\n6. **Lists and Blockquotes**: Bold text within lists or blockquotes might have additional characters at the beginning of the lines, like `* `, `- `, or `> `. The parser needs to be able to find bold text within these structures as well.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown supports multiline bold text where the starting `**` and ending `**` are on different lines. The parser needs to handle multiline formatting correctly.\n\nThese are several of the possible issues that could complicate extracting bold text from a Markdown file. The actual approach will depend on the Markdown variant being used and the strictness of the formatting rules."
