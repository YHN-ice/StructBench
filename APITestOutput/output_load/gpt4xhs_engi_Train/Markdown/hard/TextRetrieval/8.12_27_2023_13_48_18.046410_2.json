We'll need to handle both cases.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, Markdown files may contain HTML tags for embedding images, such as `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"description\" />`. We'll need to recognize and parse these as well.\n\n4. **Non-Image Files**: There might be links to non-image files that we have to ignore. We're only interested in extracting filenames of image files.\n\n5. **Special Characters and Encoding**: Filenames might contain spaces or special characters that are URL encoded. If the extracted filenames have encoding, we might need to decode them to get the correct filename.\n\n6. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line, which would require parsing each one separately.\n\n7. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown also supports reference-style links, where the link URL is not inline with the text but defined elsewhere in the document. This could make it more challenging to find and extract image URLs.\n\n8. **Linked Images**: Sometimes the image itself is a link, in which case the image syntax is nested within a link syntax.
