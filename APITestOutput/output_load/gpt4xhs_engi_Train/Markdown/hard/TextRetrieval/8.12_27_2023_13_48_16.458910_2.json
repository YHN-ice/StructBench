The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations might not include the alt text or the title, and spaces can be added around the parentheses. Some Markdown parsers also allow for reference-style images.\n\n2. **URL Formats**: Image URLs can be either relative paths or full URLs (http, https). They can also include parameters or fragments, which could complicate the extraction process if we're not accounting for these variations.\n\n3. **Encoded URLs**: Some image URLs could be URL-encoded (percent encoding), which might require decoding to get the actual file name.\n\n4. **Inline HTML**: Markdown supports inline HTML, so images could potentially be included using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Non-image File Extensions**: Some links may point to files with extensions typically associated with images (like .jpg, .png, .gif) but are not actually image files. Conversely, some images might not have a standard image extension.\n\n6. **Linked Images**: Some images might be linked, meaning that the image is also a hyperlink to another resource. This could require additional parsing logic to separate the image URL from the link target URL.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: In Markdown, characters can be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as Markdown, which could affect the parsing of image syntax if not handled properly.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown Elements**: There could be nested Markdown elements within the alt text of the image, which would need to be parsed out to correctly identify the image URL.\n\n9. **Comments**: Some Markdown files may include comments that could contain image-like syntax which should not be treated as actual images to extract.\n\n10. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown processors extend the standard Markdown language with additional features that might include non-standard ways to embed images.\n\nEach of these scenarios would need to be accounted for in a robust Markdown parsing solution to correctly extract all image file names."
