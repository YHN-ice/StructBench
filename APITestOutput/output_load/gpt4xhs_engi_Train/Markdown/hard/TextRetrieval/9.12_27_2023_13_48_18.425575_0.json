The most common are double asterisks (`**bold text**`) and double underscores (`__bold text__`). A parser must handle both cases.\n   \n2. **Nested elements**: Bold text can include other Markdown elements like links, images, or even inline code. For example, `**bold with a [link](url)**`. The parser must be able to identify the bold text without getting confused by nested elements.\n\n3. **Incomplete markers**: There might be instances where the syntax is not properly closed. For example, `**bold text`. In such cases, the parser needs to decide whether to consider it as bold or not based on the rules it follows.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they should not be treated as formatting but as literal asterisks or underscores in the text.\n\n5. **Line breaks**: Markdown processors can vary in how they handle line breaks within bold text. Some may allow for line breaks, while others may not.\n\n6. **Adjacent bold segments**: There might be multiple bold segments next to each other with no space in between, like `**bold****also bold**`. The parser needs to correctly separate these segments.\n\n7. **Whitespace handling**: Trailing or leading whitespace within the bold markers could affect whether the text is interpreted as bold.\n\n8. **Cross-paragraph bolding**: Some Markdown processors allow for bold styling to span across paragraphs, while others do not.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, the parser must be designed thoughtfully to handle these cases appropriately and extract only the correct bold text segments from the Markdown content."
