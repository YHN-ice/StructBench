The parser must identify all possible syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might also contain other formatting elements like italics, code spans, or even links. The parser must extract only the bold portion while handling or ignoring nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: The asterisks or underscores used for bold formatting could be escaped with a backslash in the Markdown content, meaning they should be treated as literal characters and not as formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed, leading to ambiguous situations on whether the text should be considered bold or not.\n\n5. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text might span multiple lines. The parser must be able to handle multiline bold text.\n\n6. **Lists and Blockquotes**: Bold text might appear within lists or blockquotes, and the parser must recognize and extract it even within these contexts.\n\n7. **Code Blocks**: Text within code blocks should not be treated as formatted text, so the parser must distinguish between code blocks and regular Markdown content.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser must be capable of recognizing the syntax for bold text and applying rules to deal with nested formatting, escaped characters, incomplete formatting, multiline text, special contexts like lists or blockquotes, and distinguishing code blocks."
