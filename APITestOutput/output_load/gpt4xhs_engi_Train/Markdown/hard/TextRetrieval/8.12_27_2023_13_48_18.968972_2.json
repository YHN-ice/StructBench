We need to be prepared to handle different valid Markdown formats.\n\n2. **False Positives**: Not every line that contains an exclamation mark followed by square brackets necessarily contains an image. For example, `![Not an Image]` is not an image link if it's not followed by parentheses containing a URL.\n\n3. **Non-Standard Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support non-standard extensions which could change the way images are embedded. For example, GitHub Flavored Markdown allows for HTML tags and relative links to repository files.\n\n4. **Relative versus Absolute URLs**: The paths to image files could be relative or absolute, and handling them might require different approaches, especially if we want to validate the existence of these files or retrieve them.\n\n5. **Linked Images**: Sometimes the image syntax can be combined with link syntax, embedding a clickable image. The parser should be able to differentiate between the link URL and the image URL within such a combination.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, the characters used to denote Markdown syntax might be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as such. The parser should account for this and not consider escaped sequences as actual Markdown syntax.\n\n7. **Nested Content**: If an image is included within other Markdown elements (like lists, blockquotes, etc.), the parser will need to be able to find images within those contexts as well."
