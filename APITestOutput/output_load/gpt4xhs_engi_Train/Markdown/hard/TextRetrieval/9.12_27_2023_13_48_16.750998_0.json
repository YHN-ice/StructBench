The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested within other formatting elements like italics, links, or even within bold text itself. The parser must be able to extract bold text even when it is nested.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: If asterisks or underscores are preceded by a backslash, they are meant to be displayed as literal characters rather than formatting indicators (`\\**not bold\\**`). The parser needs to properly ignore these.\n\n4. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (enclosed with triple backticks ``` or indented with four spaces) and inline code (enclosed with single backticks `) should not be formatted and therefore any bold syntax within them should be ignored.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting**: Sometimes Markdown contains errors like unmatched asterisks or underscores (`**bold` without a closing `**`). The parser may need to decide whether to consider these as bold formatting or not.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown does not typically support multiline bold without some sort of extension. However, the parser might encounter this and need to decide how to handle it.\n\n7. **Link Text**: The text of a link might be bolded, but the parser needs to differentiate between the actual link and the text and only extract the latter if needed.\n\n8. **List Items and Headers**: Bold text can appear in list items or headers, which adds complexity due to additional Markdown syntax characters like `*`, `-`, `+`, or `#`.\n\nBy taking these potential challenges into account, the parser must be designed robustly to handle different cases of bold text extraction in a Markdown document."
