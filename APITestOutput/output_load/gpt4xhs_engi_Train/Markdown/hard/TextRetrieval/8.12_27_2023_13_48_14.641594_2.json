The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. However, there could be variations or shorthand versions used in the document.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in a Markdown file can be linked via absolute URLs (pointing to a web resource) or relative paths (pointing to a file within the same repository or directory structure). We need to differentiate between these and decide if we only want to extract filenames or full paths.\n\n3. **Linked Images**: Sometimes, images are not directly embedded but are linked as references at the bottom of the document or within the text. This can make it more challenging to extract the image filenames.\n\n4. **Non-standard Markup**: Markdown has many flavors, and some might use non-standard ways to embed images, like HTML tags within the Markdown file. \n\n5. **Encoded URLs or Format Issues**: URLs might be URL-encoded (e.g., spaces replaced by `%20`) or use uncommon file formats that may not be immediately recognizable as an image file.\n\n6. **Complexity in Filenames**: File names might include spaces, special characters, or different casing which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **Inline Images**: Base64-encoded images could be used inline, and it may be necessary to determine if these should be extracted or ignored.\n\n8. **Markdown within Code Blocks**: Sometimes, image syntax might be within code blocks for demonstration purposes, and it would not actually be an image inclusion but rather part of a code sample.\n\nOvercoming these obstacles will require careful consideration of the Markdown syntax and possibly using regular expressions or a dedicated Markdown parser library to accurately identify and extract the image filenames."
