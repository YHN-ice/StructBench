The most common format is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but variations may occur, such as omitting the title or alt text.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images**: Images can also be included using reference-style links, which separate the URL from the image tag, e.g., `![Alt text][id]` and then defining `[id]: URL \"Title\"`. This requires recognizing and resolving references.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain HTML tags. An image might be embedded with an `<img>` tag instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: The URLs for images might be encoded or obfuscated in some way, requiring decoding to extract the actual file name.\n\n5. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be referenced via absolute URLs or relative paths. For relative paths, the actual file location would depend on the directory structure.\n\n6. **Linking to Image Anchors**: Sometimes Markdown links to anchors within image file pages rather than directly to the image files themselves. Distinguishing between these cases may be necessary.\n\n7. **False Positives in Text**: It's possible for text that appears like Markdown image syntax but isn't actually an image link to be present in the file.\n\n8. **Nested Content**: Images could be nested inside other elements like lists or blockquotes, which may add complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n9. **Escaped Characters**: Image syntax could include escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n10. **File Extensions**: Not all images will have standard `.jpg`, `.png`, etc., extensions, so the parser must be flexible enough to recognize all image types.\n\nThese are just a few potential challenges in extracting image files from a Markdown document. Depending on the Markdown flavor and document complexity, there may be additional nuances to consider."
