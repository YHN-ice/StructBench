Here are some potential challenges that might arise when trying to extract image file names from a Markdown file:\n\n1. **Syntax Variations**: Markdown allows images to be included using various syntax forms. The most common is `![Alt text](URL)`, but variations might occur. Also, image references could be indirect, with the URL referenced elsewhere in the document.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: The file paths for images can vary greatly. They can be local paths (`./image.png`), full URLs (`http://example.com/image.png`), or even contain URL parameters (`image.png?size=50`).\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files may use inline HTML tags to include images, such as `<img src=\"image.png\">`. We would need to recognize and extract these as well.\n\n4. **Alt Text Confusion**: The alt text for an image can sometimes contain a file name that could be mistaken for the actual file name, especially if it is not clearly separated from the URL.\n\n5. **Link/Image Confusion**: Links and images have similar syntax in Markdown. A link is `[text](URL)`, while an image is `![alt text](image URL)`. It's important not to confuse the two.\n\n6. **Non-standard Extensions**: While many images will end in common extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif`, there can be less common extensions or even no extension at all if the image is being served dynamically.\n\nAddressing these challenges will require careful parsing of the Markdown content to accurately identify image file names and paths."
