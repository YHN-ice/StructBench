I will need to be able to recognize both.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links `[**text**](URL)`, italics combined with bold `***text***` or `___text___`, or within code blocks where the bold syntax should not be interpreted as formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash to show the literal character, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`, which should not be counted as bold text.\n\n4. **Inconsistent formatting**: There may be incorrectly formatted bold texts, like missing an asterisk or an underscore, which could make it challenging to correctly identify the bold text.\n\n5. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text enclosed in triple backticks (```) or single backticks (`) is considered code and should not be processed for markdown formatting. Bold syntax within these blocks should be ignored.\n\n6. **Line breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines. Depending on the parser's handling, this might necessitate handling line continuation correctly.\n\n7. **List items and blockquotes**: Bold text might appear within list items or blockquotes, which may introduce additional complexity in parsing.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, the parser must have robust regex patterns or parsing logic that can accurately identify all instances of bold text while ignoring false positives and accounting for the various edge cases mentioned above."
