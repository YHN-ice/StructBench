Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Markdown Image Syntax Variations**: Markdown supports embedding images using the `![Alt text](URL)` syntax, but variations might exist, such as additional parameters for size or alignment, or the use of reference-style links.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked via absolute URLs (which includes the full path) or relative paths (which depends on the location of the Markdown file). Extracting only the filenames might be tricky if the path is complex.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may use raw HTML tags (e.g., `<img src=\"filename.jpg\">`) to embed images. Recognizing these alongside standard Markdown syntax might be required.\n\n4. **Link Confusion**: Links in Markdown are formatted similarly to images (`[Link text](URL)`) except without the exclamation mark. It's important not to confuse links with images.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: Sometimes, URLs of images might be encoded (e.g., spaces are replaced with `%20`), and decoding them might be necessary to get the correct filename.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Images might have various file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`). Ensuring that all types of image extensions are recognized is important.\n\n7. **Text Resembling Image Syntax**: There might be text within code blocks or quoted lines that resemble image syntax but are not actual images. These should not be extracted as image filenames.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we can apply these considerations to accurately extract the image filenames."
