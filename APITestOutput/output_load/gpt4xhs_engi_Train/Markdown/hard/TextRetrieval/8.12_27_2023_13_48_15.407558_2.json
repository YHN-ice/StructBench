It is necessary to recognize this pattern reliably, even if it spans multiple lines or contains various characters within the brackets or parentheses.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The image source might be a relative path (e.g., `./images/picture.jpg`), an absolute path (e.g., `/images/picture.jpg`), or a full URL (e.g., `http://example.com/images/picture.jpg`). We must extract the correct file name or path.\n\n3. **Alt Text and Title Confusion**: The alt text or the optional title might contain brackets or parentheses, which could complicate the parsing process if not accounted for properly.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: Sometimes, the URL of an image might be encoded (e.g., spaces replaced with `%20`), which might require decoding to extract the correct file name.\n\n5. **Link References**: Markdown allows images to reference links defined elsewhere in the document, which means the actual URL for the image could be separated from the image reference itself.\n\n6. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: Different implementations of Markdown might have slight variations in how images are included, so the parser must account for potential differences.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: An image link can be nested inside other Markdown elements, which might make the parsing more complex.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line, separated by other text or Markdown content, which would require the parser to identify each image source correctly.\n\n9. **Non-Image Links**: The parser must differentiate between image links and regular hyperlinks to avoid extracting non-image file names.\n\nGiven these challenges, a robust parsing algorithm should be able to navigate these potential difficulties to extract all included image file names accurately."
