Different Markdown syntaxes for bold text: Depending on the Markdown flavor, bold text can be written with double asterisks `**bold text**`, double underscores `__bold text__`, or a combination of both. We need to account for these variations.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text can be nested within other formatting elements like italic, strikethrough, or even within hyperlinks. We need to ensure that we're only extracting the bold text and not the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. Escaped characters: Asterisks or underscores that are meant to be displayed literally rather than as formatting markers could be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). We have to handle these cases properly and not interpret them as bold formatting.\n\n4. Inline code blocks: Bold syntax within inline code blocks (surrounded by backticks `) should not be treated as formatted text since they are meant to display raw text.\n\n5. Code blocks and fenced code blocks: Similar to inline code blocks, bold syntax within code blocks (indented with four spaces or surrounded by triple backticks ```) should not be interpreted as formatted text.\n\n6. Partial formatting: In some cases, only part of a word might be formatted as bold (e.g., `**bol**d`), which should still be recognized as bold text.\n\n7. Overlapping formatting: Sometimes, formatting can overlap (e.g., `**bold _and italic_**`), and this can complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. List items, blockquotes, and headers: Bold text can also appear in list items, blockquotes, and headers, which might have their own syntax that could potentially interfere with the bold formatting syntax.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser must be sophisticated enough to recognize the context in which bold formatting appears and accurately extract the bold text while ignoring non-relevant syntax. If an obstacle is encountered, such as an unrecognized pattern or ambiguity in the formatting, the parser might need additional logic to resolve it correctly."
