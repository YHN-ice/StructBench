We need to ensure that we extract only the bold text and not the other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used as literals rather than formatting characters might be escaped with a backslash (\\). We need to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: There could be errors in the Markdown file where the bold syntax is not correctly closed. Deciding how to handle these cases can be tricky.\n\n5. **Links and Images**: Bold syntax could be interleaved with links or images, which complicates the extraction process.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text inside code blocks and inline code should not be considered for formatting, so these sections should be ignored when parsing for bold text.\n\n7. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: Markdown has many flavors (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and there might be slight differences in how they interpret bold text.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we will need to define clear rules for the parser to correctly identify and extract only the bold text parts from the given Markdown content."
