I need to ensure that the parser recognizes both methods.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting markers like italics, strikethroughs, or links. I'll need to correctly parse the text to identify the bold portion without being confused by the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users can escape the bold syntax with a backslash `\\`, which means the text is not meant to be bold. The parser should recognize and ignore escaped formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete syntax**: There might be instances where the bold syntax is not correctly closed, such as `**bold text`. The parser must decide how to handle these situations.\n\n5. **Ambiguous cases**: Text containing asterisks or underscores that are not intended for formatting could be mistaken for bold syntax.\n\n6. **Line breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle line continuation correctly.\n\n7. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) and inline code (surrounded by single backticks `) should not be parsed for formatting. The parser must ignore these sections.\n\n8. **Links and images**: Text inside link or image descriptions might use bold formatting, and the parser should extract this without including the markup for links or images.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser will need to have a robust set of rules and carefully handle the context in which the bold syntax appears. Now, I can proceed to answer your question once you provide me with the input file or Markdown content containing the bold text."
