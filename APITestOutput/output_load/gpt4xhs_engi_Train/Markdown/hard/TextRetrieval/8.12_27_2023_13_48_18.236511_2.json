Differentiating between them might affect how you extract and present the file names.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but instead referenced at a different part of the document.\n\n4. **HTML Tags**: Sometimes images are embedded using raw HTML tags within a Markdown file. These `<img>` tags may contain additional attributes and require a different parsing approach.\n\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images can also be embedded in Markdown as Base64 encoded data. These are not file names but rather the image data itself, encoded in base64 format.\n\n6. **Links That Are Not Images**: There could be links in the Markdown that are not images (i.e., they link to websites or other types of files). These should not be confused with image file links.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Some image links might contain escape characters that need to be handled correctly when parsing.\n\n8. **Comments or Unrendered Sections**: Parts of the document might include comments or sections that aren't rendered as part of the final view, which could contain pseudo-image syntax that shouldn't be extracted as actual images.\n\n9. **Syntax Errors and Typos**: Human errors such as typos or incorrect syntax might make it more challenging to parse image links reliably.\n\n10. **Multiple Images on One Line**: If there are multiple images on one line, the parser must be able to handle this and extract each image file name individually.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, an accurate parser should be able to navigate these scenarios and extract only the legitimate image file names from the Markdown content."
