However, variations or errors in the syntax might make it challenging to identify all images.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be either relative to the document or absolute URLs. A parser must handle both types correctly and distinguish between them.\n\n3. **Encoded URLs**: Sometimes, the URLs within an image tag might be encoded or contain special characters that need to be decoded or handled properly.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style image links where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document. This would require the parser to resolve references correctly to extract the actual image file names.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown documents may embed raw HTML tags, including `<img>` tags. These would need to be parsed separately from the native Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Link vs. Image Confusion**: Markdown links and image syntax are similar, so it's possible to mix them up (`!` character differentiates them). The parser must correctly differentiate between links and images.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be lines with multiple images, and the parser should be capable of extracting all of them.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, characters inside Markdown syntax may be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting commands. The parser needs to recognize and handle these appropriately.\n\n9. **Images inside Lists or Blockquotes**: Images can be embedded inside other Markdown structures like lists or blockquotes, which might affect how they're parsed.\n\nTo address these challenges, a robust Markdown parser would need to use regular expressions or a parsing library designed for Markdown that can properly identify and extract image information from the document."
