The basic format is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but variations might not include alt text or title, and URLs could be either local paths or web URLs.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style images where the URL is not specified inline but defined elsewhere in the document. For example:\n   ```\n   ![Alt text][id]\n   ...\n   [id]: URL \"Title\"\n   ```\n   This could complicate the extraction process as we'd need to search for the referenced URLs separately.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax. For example:\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"Title\" />\n   ```\n   A parser that's only looking for Markdown syntax might miss these.\n\n4. **Links with Images**: Sometimes, images are included within links. The parser should be prepared to differentiate between the image URL and the link URL.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Image syntax that includes escaped characters (like `\\![Not an image](/path)`) should not be interpreted as an actual image.\n\n6. **Comments**: Markdown doesn't officially support comments, but sometimes HTML comments are used (`<!-- Comment -->`). An image link within a comment should not be extracted.\n\n7. **Text that Looks Like an Image**: In some cases, text might be formatted in a way that resembles image syntax but is not intended to be an image (e.g., code blocks).\n\n8. **Complex URLs**: Image URLs could contain parentheses, spaces, or other special characters which might be encoded or escape-quoted, complicating the correct extraction of the filename.\n\nFor each of these potential difficulties, the parser will need to have logic in place to correctly identify and handle the various cases to accurately extract all and only the image file names."
