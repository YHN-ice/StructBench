Recognizing and extracting image paths from both these formats might be required.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs. The parser will need to handle both cases correctly.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown also supports reference-style links, where the image path is not directly alongside the alt text but defined elsewhere in the document. This requires the parser to match references properly.\n\n4. **Image titles and Attributes**: Some Markdown flavors support additional attributes in the image syntax, such as titles or dimensions. These should not be confused with the file name.\n\n5. **Inline HTML and False Positives**: If the file contains HTML code blocks or comments, it might include image tag-like patterns that are not actual references to image files. The parser needs to ignore these false positives.\n\n6. **Link Within Image Syntax**: Sometimes, an image is clickable and wrapped inside a link syntax. The parser needs to distinguish between the link and the image paths.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, characters within the Markdown might be escaped, which could potentially alter the expected pattern for image links.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown Content**: There could be nested Markdown content that complicates parsing, such as images inside lists or blockquotes.\n\n9. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support non-standard extensions that may introduce alternative ways to include images.\n\n10. **Syntax Errors in the Markdown File**: If there are syntax errors in the way images are included in the Markdown file, it might be challenging to extract them correctly.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties, I am ready to process the input file and extract all included image files. Please provide the Markdown content for analysis."
