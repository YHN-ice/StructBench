Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles when extracting image file names from a Markdown file:\n\n1. **Different image syntax**: Markdown allows images to be included using `![alt text](image path)`. However, users might include images with variations in syntax or with additional attributes like titles.\n\n2. **Absolute vs relative paths**: Image paths can be either absolute URLs or relative paths. Both should be correctly identified and extracted.\n\n3. **Link references**: Images might also be included using reference-style links, where the URL is provided elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Non-standard Markdown extensions**: Some Markdown flavors allow for extensions or non-standard ways to include images, such as HTML `<img>` tags.\n\n5. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, characters like `!` or `[]` might be escaped with a backslash `\\`, making them regular text instead of part of an image syntax.\n\n6. **Nested content**: Images might be nested within other elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. **File name variations**: The parser must handle different file extensions (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif` etc.), and potentially also deal with spaces or special characters in file names.\n\n8. **Text that looks like image syntax**: There might be text within the document that resembles the image syntax but isn't meant to be an image, such as examples of Markdown usage within code blocks or inline code.\n\n9. **Images within code blocks**: If there are fenced code blocks or inline code that include image-like syntax, these should not be treated as actual images to be extracted.\n\n10. **Multiple images on one line**: There might be lines with multiple images, and the parser needs to extract all image paths from such lines.\n\nAddressing these potential issues requires careful analysis of the Markdown syntax and ensuring that the parser can distinguish between actual image inclusion and other uses of similar syntax."
