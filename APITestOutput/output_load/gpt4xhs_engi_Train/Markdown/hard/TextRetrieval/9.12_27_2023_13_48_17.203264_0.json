The most common are double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__`. For example, `**bold**` and `__bold__` both render as bold text. The parser must handle all syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements like links `[link](url)`, italics, or inline code. The parser must be able to recognize and properly handle nested elements within bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used as literal characters rather than formatting must be correctly ignored. For example, in `\\**not bold\\**`, the backslashes escape the asterisks, meaning the text should not be considered bold.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: Sometimes, Markdown may have formatting errors such as uneven asterisks or underscores like `**bold*` which may not render as bold in some parsers but may still be intended as bold.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which can complicate extraction if the parser is designed to read line by line.\n\n6. **False Positives**: Text that is not intended to be bold but contains double asterisks or underscores might be mistakenly identified as bold.\n\n7. **Contextual Understanding**: The parser must understand the context to differentiate between bold text and other uses of asterisks or underscores, such as list items or horizontal rules.\n\nThe extraction would require a careful consideration of the Markdown syntax rules and potentially a regular expression or a state-based parser that can accurately identify and extract the bold portions of text without being tripped up by these challenges."
