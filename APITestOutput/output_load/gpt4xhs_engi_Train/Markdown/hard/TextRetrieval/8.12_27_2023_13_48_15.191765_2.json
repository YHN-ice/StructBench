The parser must handle both correctly.\n\n2. **Complex URLs**: The URLs for images can be complex, including those with query parameters, anchors, or embedded credentials. The parser should correctly identify the end of the image URL.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked via absolute paths (e.g., `http://example.com/image.jpg`) or relative paths (e.g., `images/photo.jpg`). The parser should be able to differentiate and extract the file name in both cases.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Image syntax may include escaped characters that need to be properly handled to avoid false parsing.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown**: Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, so the parser should not be confused by surrounding syntax.\n\n6. **Alt Text Variations**: The alt text of an image can include various characters, including brackets that might confuse a simple parsing script.\n\n7. **Link References Elsewhere**: For reference-style images, the URL might be placed anywhere in the document, which means the parser would need to keep track of these references and match them correctly.\n\n8. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown variations or extensions may include non-standard ways to embed images that differ from traditional Markdown.\n\n9. **False Positives**: There might be false positives where the image syntax is present but commented out or inside a code block, which should be ignored by the parser.\n\n10. **File Name Extraction**: Once the URL is identified, extracting the file name from it could be challenging if the URL contains additional path elements or parameters.\n\n11. **Markdown inside HTML**: Sometimes Markdown is mixed with HTML tags, and the parser would need to differentiate between HTML image tags and Markdown image syntax.\n\n12. **Performance**: If the document is particularly large with many images, the parser's performance could become an issue.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser will need to be robust and handle a multitude of scenarios to accurately extract image file names from a Markdown document."
