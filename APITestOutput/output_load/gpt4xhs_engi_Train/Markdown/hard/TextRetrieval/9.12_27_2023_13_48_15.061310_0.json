We would need to ensure we are only extracting the bold text and not any nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used in a different context might be escaped with a backslash (`\\`). These should not be confused with formatting markers.\n\n4. **Different Markdown Flavors**: Different Markdown processors might have slightly different rules for what constitutes bold text (e.g., some might require a space after the opening `**` and before the closing `**`).\n\n5. **False Positives/Negatives**: Text that looks like it's formatted as bold (e.g., `**text**`) but is within a code block or inline code (denoted by backticks `` ` ``) should not be treated as bold since Markdown formatting is ignored within code blocks.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines, so a parser must be capable of recognizing when the bold formatting starts and ends, even if there are line breaks in between.\n\n7. **Links and Images**: Markdown syntax for links and images may include asterisks or underscores, which could be mistaken for bold formatting if not handled correctly.\n\n8. **Partial Overlapping Formatting**: Cases where only part of a word or phrase is bolded could potentially complicate extraction.\n\n9. **Special Cases**: Some Markdown parsers allow for bolding without surrounding whitespace, which is not standard but could appear in some documents.\n\nConsidering these challenges, the process of extracting bold texts from a Markdown document should be done with careful attention to the Markdown syntax to ensure accurate extraction."
