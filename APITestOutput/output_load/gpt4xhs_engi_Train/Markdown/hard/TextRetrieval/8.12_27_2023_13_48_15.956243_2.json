Various Image Syntaxes: Markdown allows images to be included using different syntaxes, such as `![alt text](image_url)` for inline images or reference-style with a separate section defining the URLs. We'll need to handle both cases.\n\n2. Line Breaks and Formatting: The image syntax could be broken up by line breaks or may include additional formatting elements that need to be accounted for.\n\n3. Alt Text Variations: The alternate text for images (`alt text`) might include special characters or even markdown formatting that needs to be correctly ignored to extract the image URLs.\n\n4. Embedded HTML: Some Markdown files might use raw HTML for embedding images (`<img src=\"image_url\" alt=\"alt text\">`). These should also be detected and processed.\n\n5. Image URLs with Markup: The image URL itself might contain markdown characters (like parentheses or brackets) which need to be correctly identified to avoid extracting an incorrect filename.\n\n6. Relative vs Absolute Paths: Images can be included with either relative paths or absolute URLs, and we need to extract these accurately.\n\n7. Non-image Links: We must distinguish between image syntax and regular hyperlink syntax to avoid confusion between the two.\n\n8. Nested Markdown Elements: Sometimes images are nested within other elements, like links or lists, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n9. File Extensions: We should recognize common image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif) to ensure that we are extracting actual images.\n\n10. Duplicates: The markdown file might include the same image multiple times; depending on the requirement, we may need to either list duplicates or filter them out.\n\nTo successfully extract all image filenames, the parser will need to carefully navigate these potential issues."
