The parser must recognize and correctly handle this syntax to extract the image URLs or file names.\n\n2. **Variations in Syntax**: Some Markdown flavors might use variations in the image syntax. For example, reference-style image links where the URL is placed elsewhere in the document. The parser needs to account for these variations.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The image reference could be either a relative path to a file within the same repository or an absolute path/URL to an external resource. Determining which type of path is used and extracting just the file name might require additional logic.\n\n4. **Inline HTML**: Markdown files can also contain inline HTML, including `<img>` tags with image sources. The parser should be capable of extracting image file names from these HTML tags as well.\n\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images can also be embedded directly into Markdown files using Base64 encoding. These would not have a traditional file name but rather a long Base64 string.\n\n6. **Link Definitions Not Used for Images**: Sometimes link definitions are present in the Markdown which are not used for images but for hyperlinks. It's important to distinguish between the two.\n\n7. **Escaped Image Syntax**: Sometimes the image syntax might be escaped to prevent it from being recognized as an image (e.g., `!\\[Alt text\\](URL \"Optional title\")`). The parser must correctly identify and ignore these cases.\n\n8. **Multiline Image Syntax**: In rare cases, the image syntax might be broken up across multiple lines. The parser might need to handle this scenario and extract the image information correctly.\n\n9. **Text that Looks Like Image Syntax**: There may be instances where regular text is formatted in a way that resembles image syntax but isn't intended to be an image (e.g., within code blocks or quoted sections).\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to create a strategy to address these challenges effectively and extract the filenames accurately."
