Identifying all possible representations and ensuring none are missed is crucial.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested inside other formatting elements like italics, blockquotes, lists, or even links. It is important to correctly parse such nested structures without losing the bold formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, the bold syntax might be escaped to display the asterisks or underscores literally instead of rendering text as bold. We need to recognize and ignore escaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **False positives**: There may be strings of asterisks or underscores that are not used for bold formatting but rather as separators or for other purposes. These should not be mistaken for bold text.\n\n5. **Multi-line bold text**: Markdown allows for bold text to span multiple lines. The parser must handle these cases correctly and not assume that bold formatting only occurs within single lines.\n\n6. **Inconsistent formatting**: Some Markdown files may have inconsistent formatting where the bold syntax is not correctly used (e.g., missing one asterisk). Identifying these as bold text may be inaccurate and can introduce errors.\n\n7. **Code blocks**: Text within code blocks should not be treated as formatted text, so any asterisks or underscores within code blocks should be ignored when searching for bold text.\n\n8. **Link descriptions**: Bold syntax within link descriptions should be properly parsed as bold text and not confused with the actual link syntax.\n\nI will need to see the input file to provide a concrete solution, but these are some of the challenges that may need to be addressed during the parsing process."
