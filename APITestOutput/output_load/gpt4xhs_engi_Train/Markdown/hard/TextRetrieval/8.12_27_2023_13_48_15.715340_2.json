It might not be clear whether to include only local image files or all images.\n\n3. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes links might be confused with image syntax, especially with reference style where the link reference and image reference might look similar.\n\n4. **Broken Image Syntax**: The Markdown file might contain typos or broken syntax that could mislead the parser.\n\n5. **Image Titles and Tooltips**: Markdown also supports titles or tooltips for images, which can appear after the URL in quotes. These should not be confused with the file name.\n\n6. **Nested Content**: Images might be included within other elements, like lists or blockquotes, which can add complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: If special characters like `!` or `[]` are escaped within the text, this could lead to false positives or negatives when parsing for images.\n\n8. **Hidden or Commented Content**: Sometimes Markdown files include comments or hidden content that won't be rendered. Deciding whether or not to consider images within such content could be challenging.\n\nTo properly address these issues, robust parsing rules need to be in place to accurately identify and extract only the image file names from the Markdown content."
