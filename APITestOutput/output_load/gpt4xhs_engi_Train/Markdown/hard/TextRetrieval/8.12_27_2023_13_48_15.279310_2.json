The two primary forms are inline image links (`![alt text](image_url \"title\")`) and reference image links (`![alt text][image_ref]`). We must be prepared to handle both.\n\n2. **URLs and Paths**: Images can be included with absolute or relative URLs or file paths. Extracting the file name might require different handling for URLs versus local paths.\n\n3. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes links can be confused with images if not parsed correctly, since the syntax is similar (for example, `[link text](url)` for links and `![alt text](image_url)` for images).\n\n4. **Title Text**: Markdown image syntax can include optional title text after the URL (e.g., `![alt text](image_url \"title\")`). This could complicate the parsing because we need to ignore this title text when extracting the file name.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown syntax allows for escaped characters, such as an escaped exclamation point `!\\[`, which could be mistaken for an image but is not.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown**: An image link might be nested within other Markdown elements, like a list item or a quote block. This means we need to parse the Markdown structure correctly to find all images.\n\n7. **In-line HTML**: Some Markdown files might include in-line HTML which could have `<img>` tags. Handling these requires HTML parsing capability.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Text that looks like an image link but isn't intended to be one (e.g., example syntax in a code block or inline code) shouldn't be treated as an actual image.\n\nTo correctly extract image file names from a Markdown file, a parser must correctly identify and handle these and potentially other edge cases."
