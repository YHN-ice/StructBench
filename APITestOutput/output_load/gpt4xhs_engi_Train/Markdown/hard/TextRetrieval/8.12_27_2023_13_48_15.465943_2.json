The most common way is `![Alt text](URL)` but there could be variations or shorthand syntaxes used that may need to be accounted for.\n\n2. **Image links versus hosted images**: Some images might be hosted externally with URLs while others could be local files. It's important to distinguish between these two as only local file names should be extracted.\n\n3. **Complex URLs**: If the image source is a URL, it might contain parameters or fragments that are not part of the file name, necessitating parsing to extract the actual file name.\n\n4. **Reference-style links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but is instead referenced by an identifier. This adds complexity to the parsing process.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes images are embedded using raw HTML tags within the Markdown file. These would need to be parsed differently from Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Nested content**: In some cases, image links might be nested within other elements, like tables or lists, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **Escaped characters or formatting**: There could be escaped characters or additional formatting within the image syntax that would need to be handled appropriately to extract just the file name.\n\n8. **Non-image files**: Not all links will be to image files. There needs to be a way to differentiate between image files and other types of files or links.\n\n9. **Incomplete or incorrect syntax**: If the Markdown file contains mistakes or incomplete image syntax, it might lead to false positives or missed images.\n\n10. **Character encoding**: Special characters in file names may be encoded differently, which could impact the extraction process.\n\nGiven these potential issues, we would need to carefully parse the Markdown file's content and apply appropriate regex patterns or parsing logic to extract just the image file names."
