Both need to be handled correctly.\n\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text might also include other formatting like italic, which is indicated with single asterisks `*` or underscores `_`. Parsing needs to differentiate between nested formatting and the actual bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Sometimes the asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash `\\`, indicating that they are not to be treated as formatting markers.\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting markers:** There might be instances where the bold formatting is not correctly closed, with missing asterisks or underscores at the end.\n\n5. **Inline code and code blocks**: If a bold marker appears within inline code (surrounded by backticks `) or code blocks, it should not be treated as bold formatting.\n\n6. **Link text and images**: Bold markers within the text of links or alt text of images require special handling, as the syntax overlaps with link and image formatting.\n\n7. **Line breaks**: Handling line breaks within bold text might affect how the text is extracted, especially if the Markdown file adheres to a strict line length and breaks bold phrases across lines.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in creating a more accurate parsing process."
