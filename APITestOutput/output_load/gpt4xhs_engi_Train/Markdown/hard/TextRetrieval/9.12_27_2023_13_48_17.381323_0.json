The parser must recognize both.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting such as italic, code snippets, links, etc., which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Incomplete markers**: Sometimes, the markers for bold formatting might be incomplete or incorrectly placed, such as `**bold`, which could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: The asterisks or underscores could be escaped with backslashes in the Markdown, indicating that they should not be treated as formatting characters (e.g., `\\**not bold**`).\n\n5. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle line breaks within bold formatting correctly.\n\n6. **Other uses of asterisks/underscores**: Asterisks and underscores are also used for bullet points and emphasis, so the parser needs to distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n7. **Contextual interpretation**: The parser needs to understand the context in which the bold markers are used, as they might be part of a URL, an image tag, or other non-text elements where they should not be interpreted as bold formatting.\n\nDue to these complexities, the parser must have a robust method to accurately identify and extract only those portions of the text that are meant to be bold."
