We need to ensure the parser recognizes both patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text may contain other Markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, inline code using backticks, or even other styling such as italics. We need to make sure that all nested elements are handled correctly so that only the bold text is extracted.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Asterisks or underscores within bold text might be escaped with a backslash to display literally. The parser should correctly interpret these escape characters.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There might be asterisks or underscores that are not meant to signify bold text (e.g., used for bullet points or within code blocks). The parser must discriminate between actual bold syntax and other uses of these characters.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle line continuations properly without breaking the bold formatting.\n\n6. **Partial Formatting**: In some cases, the bold formatting might start correctly with `**` but end incorrectly (or vice versa), which can lead to missing or incorrect extraction.\n\n7. **Adjacent Bold Sections**: There may be consecutive bold sections with no space between them; the parser should detect and extract these as separate instances of bold text.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown document is very large with many instances of bold text, performance considerations might need to be addressed to ensure the parser runs efficiently.\n\nNow you can provide the input file so that I can start parsing it according to these considerations."
