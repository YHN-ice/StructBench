This means the way bold text is indicated might vary.\n\n2. **Multiple ways to denote bold**: In Markdown, bold text can be created using double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**: Bold text in Markdown can have nested formatting, such as italic or code spans. The parser must be able to handle and ignore these nested formats to extract only the bold text.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are part of the text rather than formatting might be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which the parser needs to recognize and treat correctly.\n\n5. **False positives**: There may be instances where double asterisks or underscores appear in the text but are not meant to denote bold formatting. For example, in code blocks or inline code spans, these characters should be treated as literal text.\n\n6. **Incomplete formatting**: Sometimes, the Markdown might contain errors where the bold formatting is not properly closed (e.g., `**bold text`). The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases – whether to treat them as bold or ignore them.\n\n7. **Line breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to include the entire content within the bold formatting, taking into account line breaks.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is particularly large, performance might become an issue when parsing the file.\n\nEach of these points could influence how the parser is designed and what output it produces when extracting bold text from a Markdown file."
