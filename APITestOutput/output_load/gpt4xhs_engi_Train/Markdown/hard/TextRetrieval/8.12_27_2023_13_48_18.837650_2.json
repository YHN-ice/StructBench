Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Image Syntaxes**: Images can be included using different syntaxes, such as the standard `![Alt text](URL)` or reference style like `![Alt text][id]` where `id` is defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n2. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images can come in various file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, .svg, etc.), and the parser must be able to recognize all possible image formats.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image URLs might be absolute URLs (http:// or https://) or relative paths pointing to a location within the file system.\n\n4. **Markdown Links vs. Image Embeds**: We'll need to distinguish between Markdown links and image embeds, as the syntax is similar. A Markdown link will not have an exclamation mark before the brackets (`[Link text](URL)`), whereas an image will (`![Alt text](URL)`).\n\n5. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be nested within other elements, such as within a list or blockquote.\n\n6. **Complex URLs**: The URLs to the images could contain complex patterns, parentheses, spaces, or special characters that need to be accurately captured.\n\n7. **Image Titles**: Some images might contain an optional title after the URL, enclosed in double quotes, single quotes, or parentheses.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown may include escaped characters that could deceive the parser if not processed correctly.\n\n9. **Inline HTML**: Images might also be included using raw HTML tags within the Markdown, which would require HTML parsing capabilities.\n\n10. **Comments and Disabled Links**: Sometimes, images could be commented out or disabled in the Markdown, and we'll need to decide whether to ignore these.\n\nConsidering these complexities will help us create a comprehensive solution for parsing image file names from a Markdown file."
