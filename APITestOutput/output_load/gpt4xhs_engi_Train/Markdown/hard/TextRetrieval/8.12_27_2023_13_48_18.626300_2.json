Parsing would need to account for all variations.\n\n2. **Inline HTML Tags**: Sometimes images are embedded using raw HTML tags within Markdown documents. These would also need to be parsed correctly to extract the image file names.\n\n3. **Image Links vs Image Files**: Markdown syntax for including images is similar to that for links. Careful parsing is required to distinguish between links that lead to web pages and those that point directly to image files.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image URLs can be provided as full URLs (absolute paths) or as relative paths. Extracting filenames from the full URLs should consider just the image file name, not the entire URL.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: Some URLs might contain encoded characters or query parameters which do not form part of the actual image file name.\n\n6. **Images with Anchors or Titles**: Markdown allows adding titles or anchors which might complicate the extraction pattern.\n\n7. **Textual Noise**: Text surrounding the image syntax could potentially interfere with regex or other parsing logic implemented to extract image names.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties can help create a robust parser that can correctly identify and extract all the included image file names from a Markdown file."
