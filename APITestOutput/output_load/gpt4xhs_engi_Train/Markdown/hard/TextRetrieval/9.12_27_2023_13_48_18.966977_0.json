The parser needs to handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text can contain other markdown formatting inside it, such as italic, code spans, or links. For example, `**This is _italic_ and bold**`. The parser should be able to distinguish and extract the bold text while not getting confused by the nested formats.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks or underscores used as literal characters, escaped with backslashes, should not be mistaken for formatting markers. For example, `\\**Not bold\\**`.\n\n4. **Incomplete markers**: Text that might appear to be bold but has mismatched or incomplete markers should not be extracted as bold. For example, `**bold*` or `*not bold**`.\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: Markdown specifications could allow for bold text to span across multiple lines. The parser must detect and handle multiline bold text correctly.\n\n6. **False positives from code blocks or inline code**: Text enclosed in backticks or indented code blocks should not be processed for bold, as they represent code, not formatting.\n\n7. **Adjacent bold markers**: There might be cases where bold markers are immediately followed by more markers without spaces in between, like `****`, which could cause confusion.\n\nTo correctly extract all the bold texts from the input file, the parser will need to carefully navigate these challenges and accurately identify the intended bold formatting."
