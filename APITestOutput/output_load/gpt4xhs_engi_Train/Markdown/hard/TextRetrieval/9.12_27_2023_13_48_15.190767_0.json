However, there are a few potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process:\n\n1. **Different syntax for bold text**: In Markdown, bold text can be created using a double asterisk `**` or double underscore `__` before and after the text. We need to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might have nested formatting such as italicized text within it (e.g., `**some _italic_ and bold**`). The parser should be able to handle nested formatting without extracting the incorrect text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Bold syntax characters might be escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they should not be treated as formatting but as part of the text.\n\n4. **Incorrectly paired markers**: There may be instances where the bold markers are incorrectly paired or incomplete (e.g., `**bold text*`). Such cases should either be ignored or handled based on the requirements.\n\n5. **Text across multiple lines**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to correctly identify and extract such cases.\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code**: Bold markers within code blocks (indented by four spaces or fenced by ```) or inline code (surrounded by backticks `) should not be treated as bold text.\n\n7. **Links and images**: Bold markers may be found within link texts or image alt texts, and these should be appropriately handled to extract only the relevant bold text.\n\n8. **Other formatting markers**: Other formatting markers like headers, lists, blockquotes, etc., may precede or follow bold markers, and the parser should correctly identify bold text in these contexts.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties, please provide the input markdown file, and I will proceed with extracting the bold texts as requested."
