This may lead to confusion if the data type is not immediately apparent.\n\n7. **File Size and Performance:** Large YAML files could pose performance issues when parsing, though this is less likely to be an issue in a text-based interaction like this.\n\n8. **Parsing Errors:** Malformed YAML or syntax errors within the file could prevent proper parsing and understanding of the content.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML file or its contents, I will be able to proceed with parsing it and answering your question about the first object's id within subs."
