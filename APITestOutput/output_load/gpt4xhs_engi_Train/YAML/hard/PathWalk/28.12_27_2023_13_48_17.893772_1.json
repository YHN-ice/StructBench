If the YAML file provided has syntactical errors, it could lead to parsing errors that prevent me from correctly identifying the first object's id.\n\n4. **Alias and Anchors:** YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors which can be used to reference other parts of the document. If these are used, it may add complexity to tracing the actual value of the id.\n\n5. **Large Files:** If the input file is particularly large, it might be challenging to quickly locate the relevant section without tool assistance.\n\n6. **Variations in Key Names:** The key for the id might have different names (e.g., `id`, `ID`, `identifier`) or might be nested within another key, which would require a deeper understanding of the structure of the input file.\n\n7. **Data Types and Quoting:** YAML supports various data types and different ways of quoting strings. The id could be an integer, a string, or even another complex type, and might be quoted in different ways (single, double, no quotes) which should be handled correctly.\n\nPlease provide the YAML content or further context so that I can identify the first object's id of `subs`."
