Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the parsing process:\n\n1. **Complex Hierarchies**: YAML files can have complex nested structures that require careful parsing to correctly understand the relationships between different elements.\n\n2. **Syntactic Ambiguity**: YAML is sensitive to indentation and relies on it to define structure. Improper indentation or mixed use of tabs and spaces could lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n3. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, dates, and more. The parser must correctly identify and handle these different types.\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows for defining anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) to reuse common content. If used, the parser must resolve these references correctly.\n\n5. **Directives and Tags**: YAML can include directives and tags that could affect how data is interpreted. The parser must understand these to parse the file correctly.\n\n6. **External References**: While not a core feature of YAML, some applications might use YAML in conjunction with external references or custom extensions that could affect parsing.\n\n7. **Version Compatibility**: YAML has different versions (e.g., 1.1, 1.2), and there may be slight differences in features or syntax between versions. The parser needs to be compatible with the version used.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: If the YAML file contains errors, the parser needs to handle them gracefully, either by correcting them or by providing informative error messages.\n\n9. **Encoding**: The file encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ASCII) must be correctly handled to ensure that all characters are interpreted as intended.\n\n10. **Comments**: While comments do not affect the data structure, the parser must recognize and ignore them.\n\nOnce we see the actual YAML content, we can apply these considerations to ensure accurate parsing and to provide the correct information about the first object's `id` within `subs`."
