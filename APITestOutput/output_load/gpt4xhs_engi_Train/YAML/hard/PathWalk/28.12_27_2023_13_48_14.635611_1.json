If the indentation in the file is not correct or consistent, it might lead to confusion in interpreting the data structure.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) which allow for the reuse of elements. If these are used in the \"subs\" object, it might require additional interpretation to resolve the reference.\n\n4. **Variable Types**: YAML automatically determines data types based on the content, but sometimes it may interpret strings as numbers or vice versa if not explicitly defined, leading to potential misinterpretation.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the input YAML file is very large, it may be difficult to manually locate the \"subs\" object and its first item without automation tools or searching capabilities.\n\n6. **Special Characters**: Special characters in YAML values sometimes need to be escaped or enclosed in quotes. If this is not done properly, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Version Differences**: There are different versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1, 1.2), and they may have some differences in terms of features and parsing rules. Ensuring compatibility with the version can be an obstacle.\n\nPlease provide the YAML input so I can extract the required information about the first object's id of \"subs\"."
