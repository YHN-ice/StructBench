If the `subs` key is deeply nested, it might be challenging to locate it without a clear understanding of the hierarchy.\n\n2. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors which can make parsing more complicated. An object under `subs` might reference an anchor defined elsewhere in the document, meaning the parser must correctly resolve these references.\n\n3. **Multiple Documents**: YAML allows for multiple documents to exist in a single file, separated by `---`. The `subs` key may exist in more than one document, so it’s important to identify which document is being queried.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: While YAML aims to be human-readable, inconsistencies in formatting, such as indentation errors or mixed data types, can lead to parsing errors.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it may be computationally intensive to parse and may require efficient handling to avoid performance issues.\n\n6. **Data Types**: The `id` of the first object in `subs` could be a string, an integer, or another data type. The parser needs to handle this correctly and return the value in the appropriate format.\n\n7. **Missing or Null Values**: The first object under `subs` might have a null or missing `id`, which would need to be handled appropriately.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML content, I would be able to parse it and identify the first object's id under `subs`."
