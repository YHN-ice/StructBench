If 'subs' is a sequence of mappings, each containing an 'id', we need to understand this structure to access the first object's 'id'.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors which can create references to other parts of the document. If these are used, it might be necessary to resolve them to get the correct 'id'.\n\n4. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. We need to ensure we're looking in the correct document if this is the case.\n\n5. **YAML Version**: There are differences between YAML 1.1 and 1.2, so the parser needs to handle the file according to the right version.\n\n6. **Invalid YAML Syntax**: If the YAML file has syntax errors or is malformed, it could make parsing difficult or impossible without correction.\n\n7. **Data Types**: YAML automatically infers data types. The 'id' could be a string, a number, or another type, so when accessing it, the parser must correctly handle the data type.\n\nNow that we've identified these potential issues, please provide the YAML input so that I can attempt to parse it and answer your question about the first object's id in 'subs'."
