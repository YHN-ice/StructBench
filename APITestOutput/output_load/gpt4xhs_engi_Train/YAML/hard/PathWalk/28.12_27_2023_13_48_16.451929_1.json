If the file is not correctly indented or formatted, it can be difficult to parse or may lead to incorrect interpretations of the data hierarchy.\n\n2. **Complex Data Structures**: YAML files can contain complex nested structures. Understanding the hierarchy and navigating through nested lists and dictionaries to find the desired information can be challenging.\n\n3. **Variations in Key Names**: The naming of keys in YAML files is arbitrary and can vary. If there are variations in how keys are named (e.g., 'id', 'ID', 'Id'), this can make it difficult to extract information without accounting for all possible variations.\n\n4. **Multiple Objects with the Same Key**: There could be multiple objects with a key named 'subs', and identifying which one is being referred to would require context or additional information.\n\n5. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and booleans. Ensuring that data is correctly interpreted and cast to the proper type is crucial when extracting specific fields like an id, which might be expected to be a number or a string.\n\n6. **File Availability**: If the file is not accessible or cannot be read properly due to permission issues or file corruption, parsing will not be possible.\n\n7. **Parser Limitations**: The capabilities of the parser being used may limit what can be done with the YAML file.
