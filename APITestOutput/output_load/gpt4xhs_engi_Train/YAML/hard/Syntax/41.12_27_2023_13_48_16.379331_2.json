Mapping errors: In YAML, keys within a map must be unique. Duplicate keys can result in unexpected behavior or errors.\n4. Data types: Incorrectly formatted values (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans) might cause issues if not properly quoted or indicated.\n5. Complex structures: YAML supports complex structures like nested lists and dictionaries, which can be challenging to interpret correctly if not well-structured.\n6. Scalar styles: There are multiple ways to define strings (plain style, single-quoted, double-quoted, literal block, folded block), and mistakes in using these styles can introduce problems.\n7. Directives and tags: YAML allows for directives and tags which can affect how the document is interpreted. Misuse or misunderstanding of these can lead to errors.\n8.
