The colons at the end of some mappings are followed by what appears to be an identifier (like `:i`, `:j`, etc.), which is not valid syntax in YAML.

The use of colons prefixed with identifiers without a corresponding key-value pair is incorrect. These appear to be intended as comments or references but are not valid in YAML syntax. For example:\n   ```yaml\n   :k\n   ```\n   If these are meant to be comments, they should start with a `#` sign, and if they are meant to be references or anchors, they should be properly defined using valid YAML syntax.\n\nThe overall structure suffers from these errors and would not parse successfully in a YAML parser without corrections."
