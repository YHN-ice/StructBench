However, if the colon is meant to denote nested dictionaries without a key (as it seems here), it is incorrect because YAML mappings require a key for every value.\n\nThe correct structure should avoid using standalone colons and commas at the end of key-value pairs and ensure that every value is associated with a key, using proper indentation and hyphens for lists."
