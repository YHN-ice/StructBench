If the object with id 'm' is referred to using these features, it might be difficult to resolve without a complete view of the file.\n\n3. **Syntax Errors**: If the YAML file has syntax errors or is not well-formed, it could prevent accurate parsing.\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be challenging to efficiently find the required object.\n\n5. **Multiple Documents**: YAML can contain multiple documents within a single file, separated by `---`. If there are multiple documents, the object with id 'm' might be in any one of them.\n\n6. **Inheritance and Overrides**: Some YAML files use inheritance-like patterns where a base object is defined and other objects override or add to it. If the object with id 'm' is part of such a structure, its full content might be scattered across different parts of the file.\n\n7. **Ambiguity**: If there are multiple objects with id 'm' or if the id is not unique, it could be ambiguous as to which object's content is being requested.\n\nOnce I have the contents of the YAML file, I can parse it and extract the specific object with id 'm'.
