Understanding these references may be necessary to resolve the actual content of an object.\n\n3. **Multiple documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents, separated by `---` lines. Ensuring that the search covers all documents within the file is important.\n\n4. **Id representation**: The `id` could be represented in various ways (e.g., as a key-value pair, within a list, etc.), so the parser must handle different scenarios.\n\n5. **Data types**: YAML supports various data types, and it's essential to correctly interpret these when reading the file (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, nulls).\n\n6. **Special characters**: Handling special characters and understanding that certain characters have semantic meaning in YAML is important (e.g., `:`, `-`, `|`, `>`, etc.).\n\n7. **Inheritance and merging**: Some YAML files utilize inheritance or merging properties which can affect the final structure of an object.\n\n8. **Comments**: YAML allows comments, denoted by `#`. The parser should ignore these comments and not mistake them for data.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be capable of recursive structure traversal, interpretation of YAML-specific features like anchors and aliases, and accurate type casting while also being robust against comments and syntactical nuances."
