This variation requires extra handling to ensure that the correct key is being checked.\n7. **Embedded content**: If the content of the object is embedded within another structure or encoded, additional parsing might be required to extract it as it appears.\n8. **Data types**: YAML supports various data types, so ensuring that the id and its corresponding object are correctly handled as per their data type is important.\n\nKeep in mind that without seeing the actual YAML content, we cannot anticipate all possible issues, but these are some common challenges when parsing YAML files.\n\nNow you may provide the YAML input so I can proceed with finding the object with id `mb`."
