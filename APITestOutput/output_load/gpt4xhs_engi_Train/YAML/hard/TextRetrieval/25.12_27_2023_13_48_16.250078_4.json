These must be properly resolved to understand the actual structure.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Indentation**: YAML relies on indentation to denote structure. Inconsistent indentation can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Different data types (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) must be correctly identified and handled, especially when they are the values of deeply nested keys.\n\n5. **Multiline Strings**: YAML supports multiline strings with literal block (`|`) or folded block (`>`) syntax. These need to be accounted for as they can appear as the values of deeply nested keys.\n\n6. **Embedded JSON or Inline Syntax**: Occasionally, YAML files may contain embedded JSON or use inline syntax for lists and dictionaries. This must be parsed correctly in the context of YAML.\n\n7. **Comments**: Comments in YAML, which start with `#`, should be ignored in the parsing process but can sometimes complicate the extraction of values.\n\nTo provide accurate results, a YAML parser must handle all these nuances and ensure that it only considers the actual data structure, not any syntactical sugar or comments.
