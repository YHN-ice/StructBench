However, empty lists or dictionaries (e.g., `[]` or `{}`) should not be counted as deeply nested objects even though they might appear at a deep level.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Indentation**: YAML relies heavily on indentation to define structure. Inconsistent indentation could lead to challenges in parsing.\n\n5. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of anchors and aliases for reusing content. If deeply nested objects make use of these features, it would complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Block Scalars**: YAML allows block scalars which can span multiple lines. These can appear similar to nested structures and need to be handled properly.\n\n7. **Comments**: YAML supports comments, which need to be ignored when parsing the content.\n\n8. **Multiple Documents**: A YAML file might contain multiple documents separated by `---`.
