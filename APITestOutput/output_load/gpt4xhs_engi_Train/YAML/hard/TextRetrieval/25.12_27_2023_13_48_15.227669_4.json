Distinguishing between these types at each level of nesting is necessary to find the correct objects.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases (`*`) and anchors (`&`) to reference other parts of the document. This feature could complicate identifying the nesting level if the references point to objects at different depths.\n\n4. **Block vs. Flow Styles**: YAML allows for both block style (using indentation) and flow style (using brackets and commas). A parser must handle both styles to work correctly with any YAML file.\n\n5. **Multiline Strings**: Values in YAML can span multiple lines, which may affect how you identify the end of a nested object.\n\n6. **Variations in Indentation**: The amount of indentation used to denote nesting can vary, so the parser must be flexible enough to handle these variations.\n\n7. **Comments**: Comments can be interspersed throughout a YAML file, and a parser must be able to distinguish between actual content and comments.\n\n8. **Inherited Properties**: In case of using the `<<` merge key in YAML, there might be inherited properties from other parts of the document that could affect the depth of an object.\n\n9. **Data Types**: YAML supports explicit typing using tags, which may alter how content is interpreted and should be considered when identifying nested objects.\n\n10. **Empty Values**: Keys without values or with null values (denoted by `~` or `null`) could be present and should be properly handled.\n\nThese challenges require a parser that can understand the context and structure of the YAML content, correctly interpret various syntax elements, and reliably traverse the document structure to extract the appropriate information.
