This feature can obscure the actual depth of objects since objects can be referenced elsewhere without explicit nesting.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting:** Although YAML aims to be human-friendly, inconsistent formatting by users (such as indents with both spaces and tabs) can make it difficult to parse the file correctly.\n\n5. **Data Types:** YAML supports various data types, including nulls, timestamps, and custom tags, which might require special handling to treat them as non-list/dict values.\n\n6. **Comments and Directives:** The YAML file might contain comments (starting with `#`) and directives (such as `%YAML 1.1`). These are not part of the data but can appear interleaved with it.\n\n7. **Multiline Strings:** YAML supports multiline strings, which may look like nested objects but are actually a single scalar value. These need to be treated correctly.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust YAML parsing approach to navigate through the file structure and correctly identify the depths of each scalar value that is not a part of a list or dictionary.
