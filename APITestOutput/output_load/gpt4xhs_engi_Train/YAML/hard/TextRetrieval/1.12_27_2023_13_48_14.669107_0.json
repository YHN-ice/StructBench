Finding the object with a specific id might require navigating through deeply nested structures.\n\n3. **Multiple Documents**: YAML supports multiple documents within a single file, separated by `---`. The correct document containing the object with id `ab` needs to be identified.\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors to repeat content. If an object is referenced with an alias, it needs to be resolved to its original anchor.\n\n5. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the extracted data maintains its correct data type (e.g., string, integer, boolean) is important for accurate representation of the content.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is particularly large, it might be challenging to locate the specific object efficiently.\n\n7. **Variable Representation**: YAML allows multiple ways to represent data structures (e.g., flow style, block style). The parser must handle all these variations.\n\n8. **Encoding**: File encoding issues might lead to incorrect parsing if not handled properly.\n\nTo address these potential issues, the parser must be robust, handle errors gracefully, and be equipped with proper mechanisms to navigate and interpret the YAML content accurately.
