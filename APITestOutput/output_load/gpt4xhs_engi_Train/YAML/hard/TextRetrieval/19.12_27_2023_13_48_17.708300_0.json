If 'db' is an id within one of these documents, it's necessary to identify which document it resides in.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases (`*`) and anchors (`&`), which allow for reusing content. If the object with id 'db' is referenced with an alias, the actual content might not be immediately next to the alias reference.\n\n4. **Variations in Key Names**: Sometimes, key names can vary (e.g., 'ID', 'Id', 'id'), which requires checking for different cases or variations of the key being searched.\n\n5. **Similar Identifiers**: There might be similar identifiers in the file, such as 'DB', 'database', etc., which can lead to confusion if not carefully distinguished from 'db'.\n\n6. **Incorrect Format**: If the YAML file is not correctly formatted (e.g., indentation errors), it could lead to parsing errors, making it difficult to properly read and interpret the content.\n\n7. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be cumbersome to manually locate the specific object without the help of search functions or automated parsing.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful consideration must be given to YAML syntax, structure, and potential variations while parsing the file to extract the desired information accurately."
