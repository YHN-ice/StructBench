This could make it difficult to determine which object is being referred to without additional context.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: YAML is sensitive to indentation and formatting. If the file is not properly formatted, it might lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the data structure.\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows for the use of aliases and anchors to avoid repetition. If the object with id `y` is referred to by an alias elsewhere in the document, it may not be immediately clear that it's the same object without resolving the alias.\n\n5. **Syntactic Ambiguities**: The parser must correctly handle YAML's syntax, such as distinguishing between literal strings and other data types or interpreting special characters.\n\n6. **Size and Complexity**: A very large or complex YAML file could pose difficulties in terms of both parsing performance and ease of locating specific information within the file.\n\n7. **Lack of Schema or Schema Violations**: Without a schema or if there are violations of an expected schema, it can be challenging to interpret the meaning of certain entries or to validate the structure of the data.\n\n8. **Version Differences**: Different versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1 vs 1.2) have slight differences in their specifications.
