This could lead to confusion when determining the actual depth of a nested object.\n\n3. **Data Types**: YAML supports scalar types (strings, integers, etc.), as well as nulls, booleans, and custom types. Extracting only scalar values without considering their types might be tricky.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Indentation**: YAML relies on indentation for structure, but the user must maintain consistent spacing. Inconsistent indentation can make it difficult to parse the file accurately.\n\n5. **Block Scalars**: There are different ways to represent multi-line strings in YAML (e.g., using `|` or `>`), which might be confusing when trying to extract the actual content.\n\n6. **Comments**: YAML allows for comments, which should not be considered part of the data structure but can appear anywhere in the file.\n\n7. **Implicit vs Explicit keys**: Implicit keys (without quotes) and explicit keys (with quotes) might need different handling when parsing.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a good YAML parser should handle different data structures correctly, resolve any anchors and aliases, be aware of the different data types represented in the document, and handle comments appropriately.
