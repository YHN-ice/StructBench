Distinguishing between non-container types (like strings and numbers) and container types (like lists and dictionaries) is essential to pinpoint the most deeply nested objects.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors:** YAML supports aliases and anchors, which can create references to other parts of the document. This might complicate the traversal process as you'd need to resolve these references appropriately while maintaining the logical nesting depth.\n\n4. **Inconsistencies in Structure:** YAML documents can have inconsistent structures where similar data might be structured differently in different parts of the document. This would require a flexible parsing strategy.\n\n5. **Invalid YAML:** If the input file contains syntax errors or invalid YAML, it might not be possible to parse it correctly without pre-processing or error handling.\n\n6. **Recursion and Loops:** When processing nested structures, it's possible to encounter recursion or loops if not handled properly, especially when dealing with aliases and anchors.\n\n7. **Performance:** For very large YAML files, performance could be a concern, especially if the file needs to be read and parsed multiple times to determine the deepest nesting.\n\nNow, let's proceed with parsing the provided YAML file to identify the most deeply nested objects that do not contain lists or dicts as values.
