Any errors in the file might lead to parsing issues, which could prevent identification of the desired object.\n\n5. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If there are multiple documents in the file, it's necessary to determine which document contains the object with id `h`.\n\n6. **Ambiguity**: If there are multiple objects with the same id (though this would likely be a misuse of ids), then there will be ambiguity in determining which one you're referring to.\n\n7. **Lack of Schema**: Without a schema or a predefined structure, it might be difficult to understand what constitutes an \"object\" in the YAML file.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the file uses a character encoding that isn't properly handled, characters may not display correctly which could make it difficult to parse information accurately.\n\nTo overcome these potential obstacles, I will need to carefully parse the structure of the YAML, handle any aliases or references appropriately, manage large files efficiently, check for syntax accuracy, and disambiguate as needed to extract the correct information.
