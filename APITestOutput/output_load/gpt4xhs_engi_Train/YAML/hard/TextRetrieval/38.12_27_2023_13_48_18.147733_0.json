If the object with id 'y' uses or is referenced by an anchor, it might require resolving these references correctly.\n\n4. **Variations in Key Names**: The key that identifies the object might have variations in its name (like 'ID', 'id', 'Id', etc.), which could lead to missing the correct object if not handled properly.\n\n5. **Different Data Types**: The value of the object with id 'y' could be a simple scalar, a list, or another mapping. Identifying and presenting the excerpt as it appears in the file will depend on understanding the correct data type.\n\n6. **Presence of Comments**: YAML supports comments, which could be mistaken as part of the content if not properly handled.\n\n7. **Inclusion of Other Files**: YAML allows for inclusion of content from other files using tags like `!include`. If the object with id 'y' is included from another file, it might be necessary to retrieve content from that file.\n\nNow that we have outlined potential difficulties, I would need to see the actual YAML content to parse it and find the object with id 'y'.
