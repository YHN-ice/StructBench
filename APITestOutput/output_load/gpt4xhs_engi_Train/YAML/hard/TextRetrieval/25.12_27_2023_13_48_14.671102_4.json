This can complicate the parsing process if not properly handled.\n\n3. **Type Coercion**: YAML automatically determines the data type of a value based on its content. It's important to correctly identify scalar types (string, integer, boolean, etc.) even when YAML's implicit typing might represent them differently.\n\n4. **Block vs. Flow Style**: YAML supports multiple styles (block and flow) for writing collections (lists and maps). A parser must handle both styles correctly.\n\n5. **Inheritance and Merging**: YAML has features that allow inheritance and merging of data, which could affect how the depth of a particular item is determined.\n\n6. **Variations in Indentation**: Correctly identifying the structure relies on consistent indentation. However, variations or errors in indentation could lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Comments**: While comments do not affect the structure, they need to be ignored when parsing the file.\n\n8. **Multiline Strings**: Handling multiline strings can be tricky if we need to preserve the exact formatting.\n\n9. **Document Start and End Indicators**: Proper handling of document start (`---`) and end (`...`) indicators is necessary to parse documents correctly.\n\n10. **Multiple Documents in One File**: A YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`.
