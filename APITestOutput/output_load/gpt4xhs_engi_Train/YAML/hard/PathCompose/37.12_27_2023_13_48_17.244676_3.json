Lists are accessed via numeric indices, while maps are accessed through keys. Confusing the two can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Types**: YAML allows both homogeneous (e.g., all elements are of the same type) and heterogeneous (elements of different types) collections. Handling them correctly is important.\n\n4. **Key Names with Special Characters or Spaces**: YAML keys can contain spaces or special characters, requiring quoting or special handling in some parsers.\n\n5. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports aliases and anchors for reusing content. Understanding these references is necessary to correctly interpret the file content.\n\n6. **Type Casting**: YAML implicitly types content, but sometimes the parser needs explicit instructions on how to interpret strings, integers, booleans, nulls, etc.\n\n7. **Version Differences**: YAML 1.1 and 1.2 have some differences. Knowing which version the file adheres to can be important.\n\n8. **Parsing Errors**: Incorrect indentation or syntax errors in the YAML file can lead to parsing errors that must be handled gracefully.\n\n9. **Security Issues**: Unsafe loading of YAML can lead to code execution vulnerabilities if the content includes arbitrary objects.
