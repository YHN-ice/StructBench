However, if there are duplicated keys, it could create confusion when trying to access a specific value.\n4. **Aliases and anchors**: YAML allows for reusing elements with aliases and anchors, which could complicate the access path if not understood correctly.\n5. **Type casting**: YAML is type-sensitive, so it's important to know the type of the elements you're trying to access (e.g., whether a key is a string or an integer).\n6. **Variations in syntax**: There are multiple ways to represent the same structure in YAML, such as inline vs. block notation, which might affect how you parse the file.\n7. **Typos or syntax errors**: Human errors in the YAML file like typos or syntax issues can lead to errors when trying to parse the file.\n\nIt's important to take these potential issues into account and carefully navigate the structure of the YAML file to accurately access the desired value."
