The path to a value will differ if the value is within a sequence (where you'd use an index) or a mapping (where you'd use a key).\n\n3. **Similar Keys**: If the file contains keys with similar or identical names at different levels or within different branches, it can be challenging to specify which key you're referring to without providing the full context.\n\n4. **Ambiguity with Dashes (-)**: In YAML, a dash indicates an item in a list. If not formatted correctly, it may be confusing whether the dash is part of a string or represents a list item.\n\n5. **Special Characters in Keys**: If keys contain special characters or spaces, they might need to be handled differently or enclosed in quotes to be accessed correctly.\n\n6. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports aliases and anchors for repeating content.
