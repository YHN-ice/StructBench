Ambiguous keys: In some cases, keys might be repeated at different nesting levels, or different types of elements (e.g., maps and sequences) might have the same name, which can lead to confusion when trying to access a specific value.\n\n3. Type conversion: YAML is type-aware and can contain strings, integers, booleans, and other data types. Ensuring the correct type is accessed and converted if necessary is important.\n\n4. List indices: When dealing with lists, one must use the correct index to access a particular element. Indices in most programming languages are zero-based, so it's important to keep track of the correct index.\n\n5. Syntactical errors: Incorrect indentation or syntax errors in the YAML file can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the structure.\n\n6.
