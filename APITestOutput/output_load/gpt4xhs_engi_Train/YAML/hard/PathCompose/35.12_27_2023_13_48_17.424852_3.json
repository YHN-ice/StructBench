If the value you're trying to access is referenced through an alias, you need to find the original anchor it points to.\n\n5. **Data Types**: YAML can include various data types like strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, dates, etc. Ensuring that the parser correctly identifies and handles these types is essential.\n\n6. **YAML Version**: There are different versions of YAML (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 1.2), and some features or syntax may vary between versions.
