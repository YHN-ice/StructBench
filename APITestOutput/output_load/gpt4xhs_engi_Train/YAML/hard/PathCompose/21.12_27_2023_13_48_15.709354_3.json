Nested structures: YAML allows for complex nested structures which can sometimes be difficult to navigate. Knowing the exact path through keys and indices is necessary.\n\n2. Lists vs. dictionaries: YAML supports both lists (arrays) and dictionaries (hashes), and the syntax for accessing elements within them differs (using indices for lists and keys for dictionaries).\n\n3. Type casting: The values in a YAML file can be strings, numbers, booleans, etc. Ensuring that you're interacting with the correct type when retrieving a value is important.\n\n4. Similar or duplicated keys: If there are keys with similar names or duplicated keys within different levels of the structure, it's important to ensure that you're accessing the correct one.\n\n5. Special characters in keys: Sometimes keys can contain special characters or spaces which may require additional syntax or methods to access correctly.\n\n6. Anchors and aliases: YAML allows defining anchors ('&') and aliases ('*') which can be used to reference previously defined content. Understanding these references is crucial for accurate data retrieval.\n\n7. Multiline strings: YAML supports multiline strings which might complicate accessing a value if not handled correctly.\n\n8. Indentation: Since YAML relies on indentation to define structure, incorrect indentation can lead to misinterpretation of the hierarchy in the content and therefore incorrect access paths.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it's important to carefully analyze the structure of the YAML file, ensure correct syntax is used when constructing the access path, and handle any special cases as they arise."
