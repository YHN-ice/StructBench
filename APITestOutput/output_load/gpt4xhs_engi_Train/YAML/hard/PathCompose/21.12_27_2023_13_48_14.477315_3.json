        "Based on the structured input you provided, which appears to be a representation of YAML-like content, we can access the value \"n\" by navigating through the nested objects and arrays. The value \"n\" is nested within an object with an `id` of \"j\". To reach it, we first go through the first level with the `id` of \"h\", then to the `subs` array, choosing the first element (index 0) with the `id` of \"i\".
