Some potential difficulties and obstacles that may arise when trying to provide the correct answer could include:\n\n1. **YAML Syntax Errors**: If the given YAML file contains syntax errors such as incorrect indentation, missing colons, or improper use of dashes, it can lead to parsing errors making it challenging to extract the desired information.\n\n2. **Ambiguous Identifiers**: In case the identifier 'i' is not unique or is used in multiple contexts within the file, it might be difficult to determine which object the question refers to.\n\n3. **Nested Structures**: YAML files often contain nested structures. If the object with id 'i' is deeply nested, it might require careful navigation through the hierarchy to retrieve the exact excerpt.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be challenging to efficiently find the object with id 'i' without an efficient search mechanism.\n\n5. **Variations in Data Types**: YAML supports various data types like scalars, lists, and maps. The object with id 'i' could be part of any of these data types, requiring different parsing strategies.\n\n6. **References and Anchors**: YAML allows for the use of anchors and aliases to reference other parts of the document. If the object with id 'i' uses these features, resolving the references correctly will be essential to provide an accurate answer.\n\n7. **Encoding and Character Set Issues**: The character encoding of the YAML file could potentially cause issues if it's not properly handled or if there are special characters within the content.\n\n8. **Version of YAML**: The features and syntax can differ slightly between different versions of YAML (1.1, 1.2, etc.). Knowing the version might be necessary for correct parsing.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML content or further context, I can proceed to parse it and answer your question accordingly."
