Handling these might complicate the parsing process.\n\n3. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types and correctly identifying them, especially distinguishing between lists, dictionaries, and scalar values (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans) could be tricky.\n\n4. **Syntactical Ambiguities**: If the YAML is not well-formed or if it contains ambiguities in syntax (such as indentation errors), it may be difficult to parse correctly.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is large, it might be memory-intensive to process, especially if we need to hold the entire structure in memory to determine the deepest objects.\n\n6. **Embedded Documents**: YAML allows for multiple documents within a single file, separated by `---`. Ensuring that each document is parsed separately could be a challenge.\n\n7. **Comments and Directives**: The file might contain comments or directives that need to be ignored during parsing.\n\nOnce the YAML file is provided, I'll be able to parse it while considering these potential obstacles."
