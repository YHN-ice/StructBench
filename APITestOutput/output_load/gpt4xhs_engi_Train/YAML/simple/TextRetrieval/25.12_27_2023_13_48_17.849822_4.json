        "Based on the input YAML snippet provided and the criterion that we are interested in the most deeply nested objects that are neither lists nor dictionaries, the most deeply nested object is:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"w\"\nX: w,\nsubs: []\n```\n\nThis object is a dictionary with keys `id`, `X`, and `subs`. While `subs` is an empty list, it does not contain further nested structures, which aligns with the requirement that we are not looking for values of type list or dict. The other objects at higher levels (`id: \"u\"` and `id: \"v\"`) have nested objects within them, so they do not meet the criteria.\n\nPlease note that the commas after `Z: y` and `Y: x` are not typically used in YAML and might be a formatting error.
