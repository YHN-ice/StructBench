Inconsistent or incorrect indentation can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the data hierarchy.\n\n3. **Aliasing and anchors:** YAML supports aliases and anchors, which could be used to reference other parts of the document. Resolving these references correctly might be challenging.\n\n4. **Data types:** YAML supports various data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, and dates. Ensuring that the parser accurately identifies and handles each type is crucial.\n\n5. **Multiline strings:** YAML allows strings to span multiple lines, either as block literals or folded style. Properly capturing these and distinguishing them from nested structures could be tricky.\n\n6. **Tags and custom types:** YAML allows defining custom data types using tags, which may not be directly supported by a generic parser and could require additional logic to handle.\n\n7. **Large files and performance:** If the YAML file is very large, performance might become an issue, especially if the parsing requires multiple passes or complex tree traversal.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in mapping keys:** In rare cases, YAML allows for complex keys that can be difficult to parse and may appear as nested structures.\n\nTo identify the most deeply nested objects without list or dict values, one needs to perform a depth-first search, while keeping track of the nesting level, and outputting the data at the maximum depth found.
