If the object with id 'c' is referenced via an alias, it might not be immediately obvious without analyzing the entire document.\n\n3. **Complex nested structures**: If the YAML file contains deeply nested structures, locating a specific object by its id might require traversing multiple levels of the document.\n\n4. **Multiple documents in one file**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If the 'id: c' is in a document that is not the first one, it needs to be identified.\n\n5. **Large files**: If the YAML file is particularly large, it may be challenging to pinpoint the exact location of the object with id 'c' without proper tools or search functions.\n\n6. **Special characters in ids**: If ids contain characters that have specific meanings in YAML (like colons, commas, etc.), they need to be correctly identified and possibly quoted.\n\n7. **Duplicate ids**: If there are multiple objects with an id of 'c', determining which one is being asked for could be problematic.\n\nUnderstanding and overcoming these challenges will be necessary to parse the YAML file correctly and retrieve the requested information.
