Identifying and skipping these while searching for the deepest elements could be tricky if the YAML structure is not consistent or if lists and dicts are nested within each other.\n\n3. **Scalar Values:** Determining whether a nested object is a scalar value (e.g., string, number, boolean) or a complex type is essential because only scalar values are of interest according to your requirement.\n\n4. **Multiple Paths:** The YAML file might have multiple paths with equally deep nesting. All such paths would have to be identified.\n\n5. **Anchors and Aliases:** YAML supports anchors and aliases, which can create references to other parts of the document.
