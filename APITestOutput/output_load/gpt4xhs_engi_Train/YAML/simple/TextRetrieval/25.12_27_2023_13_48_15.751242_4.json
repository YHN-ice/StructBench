Keeping track of the deepest level requires a recursive or iterative approach with a stack or similar data structure to maintain state.\n\n2. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports aliases and anchors which can create references to other parts of the document. This could complicate the traversal as we'd need to resolve these references properly.\n\n3. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents, separated by `---`. Each document needs to be parsed and checked individually.\n\n4. **Data Type Handling**: In YAML, values can be strings, numbers, booleans, etc. Understanding when a value constitutes an object (i.e., a terminal value in a tree traversal) or a nested structure (list or dict) is crucial.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Indentation**: While YAML relies heavily on indentation, inconsistent indentation could lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the structure's depth.\n\n6. **Mixed Data Types**: Lists and dictionaries can contain mixed types, adding complexity to determining what counts as a most deeply nested object.\n\n7. **Syntactical Ambiguities**: YAML has some syntactical quirks, like the use of question marks to indicate complex keys or colons within strings without quotes that could be misinterpreted as key-value separators.\n\n8. **Large Files**: Very large YAML files can pose performance issues or make it harder to keep track of the entire structure in memory.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust YAML parser would need to correctly interpret the syntax and semantics of YAML, handle various data types, manage references, and traverse the data structure efficiently while keeping track of the maximum depth and its associated values."
