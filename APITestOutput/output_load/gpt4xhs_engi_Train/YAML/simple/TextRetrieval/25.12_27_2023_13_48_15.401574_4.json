        "Based on the input provided, the most deeply nested objects are those at the deepest level of the hierarchy without any further nested lists or dictionaries.

They are as follows:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"ab\"\nX: e,\nsubs: []\n```\n\n```yaml\nY: f,\n```\n\nThe `id: \"ab\"` object is the deepest because it has a list (`subs`) which is empty, indicating there are no further nested objects.

The trailing commas are preserved as per the original formatting.\n\nPlease note that the interpretation can be ambiguous because it is not entirely clear from the question whether an empty list as a value should still be considered a deeply nested object or not.
