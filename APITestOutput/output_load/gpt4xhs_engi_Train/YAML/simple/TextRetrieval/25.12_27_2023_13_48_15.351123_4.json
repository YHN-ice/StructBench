The most deeply nested objects could be a mix of these types, making it harder to discern.\n\n3. **References and Anchors**: YAML allows for references and anchors which can create complex relationships between different parts of the document. This can complicate finding the most deeply nested objects if they are referenced elsewhere.\n\n4. **Inheritance and Overrides**: In some cases, YAML structures may use inheritance or override patterns that can affect the contents of nested objects.\n\n5. **Syntactic Ambiguities**: YAML is sensitive to indentation and other syntactic elements. Incorrectly indented content or ambiguous syntax could lead to misinterpretation of the nesting level.\n\n6. **Large Files and Performance**: Very large YAML files may pose performance issues, especially if every single level needs to be checked for the depth of nesting.\n\n7. **Multiple Candidates**: There might be multiple most deeply nested objects at the same level of nesting.
