        "Based on the input provided and the task at hand, we need to identify the most deeply nested objects within the given YAML content. The most deeply nested objects are those that do not contain any further lists or dictionaries.

The deepest level with no further \"subs\" list or dictionary is the one we're interested in.\n\nLet's look at the YAML content to identify such objects:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"l\"\nZ: i,\nsubs: \n  - id: \"m\"\n    Y: h,\n    subs: \n      - id: \"n\"\n        X: g,\n        subs: []\n```\n\nThe most deeply nested object, which does not contain a list or dictionary as a value, is the object with the id \"n\". It contains an \"X\" key and an empty \"subs\" list. The excerpt as it appears in the YAML file, separated by a newline (as requested), is:\n\n```\nid: \"n\"\nX: g,\nsubs: []\n```\n\nPlease note that in YAML the trailing commas are not standard and may lead to parsing errors. Assuming this is a typo, the correct YAML format would exclude the commas after the scalar values (i.e., `X: g` instead of `X: g,`)."
