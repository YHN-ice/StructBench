This might complicate identifying the most deeply nested standalone objects.\n\n4. **Multiline Strings**: YAML supports multiline strings, which might appear as deeply nested structures at first glance but are actually single values.\n\n5. **Interpretation of Keys and Values**: Deciding what constitutes an \"object\" might be subjective. For instance, if a key has a simple value like a string or a number, do we consider it as an object or look for nested dictionaries or lists?\n\n6. **Syntactical Ambiguities**: In YAML, indentation is crucial for defining structure. Improper indentation can cause ambiguity in the interpretation of the document structure.\n\n7. **Embedded JSON or Serialized Data**: Sometimes a YAML file might contain embedded JSON or other serialized data formats, which could be complex to parse if they're treated as plain strings.\n\n8. **File Size and Memory Constraints**: If the YAML file is very large, parsing it efficiently without running out of memory could be a challenge.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a systematic approach is needed to parse and traverse the document, keeping track of nesting levels and only considering objects that have no further nested lists or dictionaries as their values."
