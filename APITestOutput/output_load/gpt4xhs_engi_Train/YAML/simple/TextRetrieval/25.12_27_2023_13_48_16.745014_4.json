If not properly resolved, these might complicate the parsing process.\n\n3. **Data Types Consistency:** YAML is flexible with data types. Ensuring that the parser correctly identifies non-object values (strings, integers, booleans, etc.) across various contexts is crucial.\n\n4. **Multiline Strings:** YAML supports multiline strings that might be difficult to extract verbatim if the parser is not handling them correctly.\n\n5. **Block vs. Flow Styles:** YAML has multiple ways of representing data structures (block style with indentation or flow style with brackets). The parser must handle both styles to ensure accurate extraction of deeply nested objects.\n\n6. **Inheritance and Extensions:** In some cases, YAML files might use inheritance or extensions of previous objects, which could require additional logic to handle.\n\n7. **Comments:** YAML allows for comments, which should not be mistaken for actual data by the parser.\n\n8. **Indentation Sensitivity:** Since YAML relies on indentation for its structure, inconsistent or incorrect indentation could lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the nesting level.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it's important for a parser to handle a wide range of YAML features and specifications to accurately find and extract the most deeply nested objects."
