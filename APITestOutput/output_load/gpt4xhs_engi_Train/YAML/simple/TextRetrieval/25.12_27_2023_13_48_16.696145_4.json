Identifying the deepest level requires a thorough traversal of the entire structure.\n\n2. **Scalar Values**: YAML supports various types of scalar values (strings, integers, booleans, etc.), and determining whether an object is the most deeply nested might require checking if it contains any non-scalar values.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows defining anchors (using `&`) and aliases (using `*`) to reference other parts of the document. This can make it harder to determine the actual depth of an object since it may not be defined inline.\n\n4. **Sequence Items**: Lists (sequences in YAML) can contain nested objects. A sequence itself is not a deeply nested object, but items within it could be.\n\n5. **Block vs. Flow Styles**: YAML allows representing structures in block style (using indentation) or flow style (using brackets and commas). The parser must handle both styles correctly.\n\n6. **Implicit Types**: YAML has implicit typing, which means that strings do not necessarily have to be quoted. The parser must correctly interpret scalar values.\n\n7. **Inheritance and Merging**: YAML supports inheritance and merging of maps using the `<<` merge key, which can add another layer of complexity to resolving the actual structure.\n\n8. **Comments**: YAML supports comments, which should be ignored when parsing the file.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML file, I would parse it to identify the most deeply nested objects that do not contain any lists or dictionaries and present excerpts of these objects as they appear in the file, while dealing with these potential challenges."
