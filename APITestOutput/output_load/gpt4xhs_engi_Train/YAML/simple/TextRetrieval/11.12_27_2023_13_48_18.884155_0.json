If the object with id 'c' is referenced via an alias, it may not be immediately clear what the content is without resolving the reference.\n\n3. **Multiple Documents:** A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. The object with id 'c' could be in any of these documents, so I would need to examine each one.\n\n4. **Syntax Errors:** If the YAML file contains syntax errors, it may not be parsed correctly, which could lead to difficulty in locating and extracting the correct information.\n\n5. **Lack of Schema:** YAML does not require a schema, so objects are not guaranteed to have an 'id' field. If the document is not consistent, finding the object with id 'c' might require searching through various types of elements.\n\n6. **Variability in Data Types:** YAML supports scalar values, sequences, and mappings, so the object with id 'c' could be part of any of these data types, potentially increasing the complexity of locating it.\n\n7. **YAML Version:** Different versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) might have slight differences in interpretation, which could affect parsing.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues:** If the file is not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), this may lead to issues with special characters or incorrect parsing.\n\nPlease provide the YAML file content so I can proceed to locate the object with id 'c'."
