The parser must handle these variations and recognize when it has reached a scalar value (e.g., string, number, boolean) that is not further nestable.\n\n3. **Keeping Track of Nesting Levels**: To find the most deeply nested objects, the parser must keep track of the current depth as it traverses the structure.\n\n4. **Capturing Excerpts**: When a deeply nested object is identified, the parser must be able to extract the relevant excerpt in its original format, which includes maintaining proper indentation.\n\n5. **Handling Multiple Deeply Nested Objects**: It's possible that there are several objects at the same deepest level. The parser should identify and return all such instances.\n\n6. **Preserving Sequence**: If required, the parser has to maintain the order in which the most deeply nested elements appear in the YAML file.\n\n7. **Scalar Lists**: Lists that contain only scalar values (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`) should not be considered further nestable, so these should either be included or excluded based on the task requirements.\n\n8. **Duplicate Paths**: The YAML file could contain multiple paths with deeply nested objects of equivalent depth. Care must be taken to handle them individually.\n\nGiven these challenges, a robust YAML parsing algorithm needs to be able to systematically navigate through each node, keep track of nesting levels, and correctly extract and report the required excerpts without introducing any artifacts or losing information.
