Determining the deepest level requires parsing the entire structure accurately.\n\n2. **Mixed content types**: YAML supports various data types, including lists (arrays) and dictionaries (maps). Deeply nested objects could be within lists or other dictionaries, so the parser must be able to differentiate and navigate through these structures.\n\n3. **Scalar values**: The deeply nested objects we're looking for should not be of type list or dict, but scalar values (e.g., strings, integers, booleans). The parser has to properly identify these scalar values.\n\n4. **Aliases and anchors**: YAML allows defining anchors and using aliases to repeat content. The parser should correctly resolve these references.\n\n5. **Block and flow styles**: YAML has multiple styles (block and flow) for representing structures. A parser must handle both styles to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. **Consistency**: The output format must be consistent, displaying excerpts as they appear in the original YAML file.\n\n7. **Implicit types**: YAML type coercion might interpret unquoted strings as different data types (e.g., `yes` as `true`). The parser should maintain the original representation.\n\nGiven these challenges, the parser needs to be robust, handle edge cases, and respect the original formatting to provide an accurate answer."
