If the indentation is inconsistent or incorrect, it could lead to misinterpretation of the hierarchy within the data.\n\n2. Complex Hierarchies: YAML files can contain deeply nested structures. Navigating these structures to find the correct object or value can be challenging.\n\n3. Aliases and Anchors: YAML supports the use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) to reference other parts of the document. If used, these need to be resolved correctly to understand the references.\n\n4. Data Types: YAML supports various data types such as scalars, lists, and maps. Identifying and correctly parsing these types is crucial for accurate data extraction.\n\n5. Special Characters: Certain characters have special meanings in YAML, such as `#` for comments, `|` for block literals, `>` for folded blocks, etc. These need to be handled correctly during parsing.\n\n6. Multiple Documents: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If this is the case, it's important to identify which document contains the object with id `n`.\n\n7. Inheritance and Merging: YAML allows inheritance and merging of properties, which might lead to complex structures that are not immediately apparent.\n\n8. Scalars with Special Characters: Scalars containing characters like `:` or `-` can be mistaken for key-value pairs or list items if not correctly quoted or escaped.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, I will have to overcome these potential obstacles by carefully interpreting the YAML content you provide. Please share the YAML file content so I can assist you further."
