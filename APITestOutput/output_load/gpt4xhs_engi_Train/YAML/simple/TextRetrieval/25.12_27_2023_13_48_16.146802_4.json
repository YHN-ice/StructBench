Identifying the deepest level might require a recursive approach or a well-structured algorithm to navigate through the nested structures.\n\n2. **Variety of Data Types:** YAML supports various data types such as strings, numbers, arrays (lists), and maps (dictionaries). We need to ensure that we correctly handle each type and identify only those objects that are not lists or dictionaries.\n\n3. **Inline vs. Block Styles:** YAML has different styles for representing data, such as block style and flow (inline) style. The parser must handle both styles correctly to identify the deeply nested objects.\n\n4. **References and Anchors:** YAML supports the use of anchors and aliases to reference other parts of the document. It's important to correctly resolve these references when looking for nested objects.\n\n5. **Implicit vs. Explicit Typing:** YAML allows for implicit typing based on the value's format, but also allows for explicit typing with tags. The parser must correctly interpret these types.\n\n6. **Consistency in Output Formatting:** When extracting excerpts as they appear in the YAML file, the parser must maintain the original formatting to ensure accurate representation.\n\n7. **Error Handling:** The parser must handle errors gracefully, such as incorrect indentation, missing colons, or invalid characters, which could otherwise lead to incorrect parsing results.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser would need to:\n\n- Ensure correct handling of different data types.\n- Correctly interpret and navigate through varying nesting levels.\n- Handle both inline and block styles seamlessly.\n- Resolve references and anchors accurately.\n- Interpret implicit and explicit typing properly.\n- Maintain original formatting when presenting output.\n- Implement robust error handling mechanisms.\n\nOnce the YAML file content is provided, we can proceed with parsing it to identify the most deeply nested objects that are neither lists nor dictionaries."
