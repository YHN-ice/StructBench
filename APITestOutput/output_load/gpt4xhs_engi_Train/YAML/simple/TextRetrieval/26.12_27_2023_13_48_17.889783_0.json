If the object with id 'w' is referenced using an alias, it may not be immediately apparent without resolving the alias.\n\n3. **Type Casting**: YAML automatically casts data types based on the content, which can sometimes lead to unexpected types unless explicitly specified. Ensuring that the content of object 'w' is interpreted correctly is crucial.\n\n4. **Multi-Document Support**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If object 'w' is in a non-initial document, it would be necessary to parse through each document.\n\n5. **Comments and Whitespace**: YAML files can include comments and are sensitive to whitespace, which means that formatting must be preserved to maintain the structure and meaning of the content.\n\n6. **Inheritance via Extends**: Some YAML files simulate inheritance using a custom extends-like feature to share common settings between objects. Understanding such custom practices would require additional logic.\n\n7. **YAML Version**: YAML has evolved over time, and certain features or syntax may differ between versions (e.g., 1.1 vs 1.2). Ensuring compatibility with the version at hand is important.\n\n8. **Character Encoding**: If the YAML file uses an uncommon character encoding, it might pose a problem for parsers expecting UTF-8 or another standard encoding.\n\n9. **File Size**: Very large YAML files could pose a performance issue, depending on the parser's efficiency and available system resources.\n\n10. **Content Security**: If the YAML file contains secure or sensitive information, there could be security concerns regarding exposure of such details.\n\nOnce I am provided with the input file, I will parse it while keeping the above potential challenges in mind to accurately extract and present the content related to object with id 'w'."
