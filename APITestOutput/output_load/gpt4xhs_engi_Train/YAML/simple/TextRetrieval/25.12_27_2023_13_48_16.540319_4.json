We need to correctly identify when an object is not a list or dictionary (map).\n\n4. **Aliases and References**: YAML allows for the use of aliases and references, which can complicate the traversal of the data structure if they need to be resolved.\n\n5. **Embedded Documents**: YAML allows for multiple documents to be embedded within a single file, separated by `---`. We need to ensure we are parsing all documents within the file, if applicable.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust parsing algorithm would keep track of nesting levels while traversing the document, properly handle indentation, and accurately determine the type of each element to find those that meet the criteria of being neither a list nor a dictionary while being the most deeply nested.
