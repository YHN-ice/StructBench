Inconsistent or incorrect indentation can make parsing difficult and lead to errors.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors, which can create references to other parts of the document. This can complicate the determination of nesting levels as the same object may appear in multiple places.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Differentiating between scalar values, lists, and dictionaries is crucial. Only scalar values (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans) are considered non-nested objects.\n\n5. **Block vs. Flow Styles**: YAML supports multiple syntax styles for lists and dictionaries (block style with indentation and flow style with brackets/braces). The parser must handle both.\n\n6. **Multiline Strings**: YAML supports multiline strings which can be written in different ways (e.g., using `|` for literal style or `>` for folded style). These should not be confused with nested objects.\n\n7. **Empty Values or Nulls**: It's important to identify whether a key with a null value or an empty value is considered a deeply nested object.\n\n8. **Comments**: YAML comments (starting with `#`) should be ignored by the parser but could be visually misleading when manually inspecting the file.\n\n9. **Inheritance and Extensions**: Some YAML documents may use extensions or custom tags that affect how data is interpreted or inherited.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, the parser must be robust enough to handle complex documents accurately to determine the most deeply nested objects without encountering these issues.
