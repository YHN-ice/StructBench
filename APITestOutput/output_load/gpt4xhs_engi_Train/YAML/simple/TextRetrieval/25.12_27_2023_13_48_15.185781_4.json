We need to differentiate between these types to spot the non-list and non-dict terminal values.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: YAML is sensitive to indentation and formatting. Inconsistent use of spaces or tabs for indentation might lead to parsing errors or incorrect interpretation of the structure.\n\n4. **References and Anchors**: YAML supports references and anchors which allow for reuse of portions of the document. These can complicate understanding the actual structure without resolving them.\n\n5. **Large Files and Performance**: If the YAML file is particularly large, it might take some time to parse, and performance could become an issue.\n\n6. **Embedded Content**: YAML allows for embedding of JSON or other content types, which might not follow YAML syntax rules.\n\n7. **Comments and Directives**: Comments (`#`) and directives (e.g., `%YAML 1.2`) may be present and should be ignored when parsing for actual values.\n\n8. **Duplicates and Merges**: YAML has features to merge duplicated keys, which might affect how we interpret the most deeply nested objects.\n\nOnce we see the YAML input, we'll need to address these challenges accordingly to extract the requested information accurately."
