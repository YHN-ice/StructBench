Handling these correctly requires additional logic to resolve references.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Indentation:** Since YAML relies on indentation for its structure, inconsistent indentation can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy levels.\n\n5. **Large Files:** A very large YAML file could pose performance issues, making it difficult to process in a timely manner.\n\n6. **Special Characters:** Special characters and indicators (such as `---` for document start or `...` for document end) might be misinterpreted if not handled correctly.\n\n7. **Data Types Interpretation:** YAML automatically interprets data types based on their format (e.g., true/false for booleans, numbers without quotes, etc.). Ensuring that the values are interpreted as intended rather than as their implicit data type can be tricky.\n\n8. **Multiline Strings:** Multiline strings can be written in several ways (e.g., using `|` or `>`), which may affect how they're interpreted within deeply nested objects.\n\nOnce I have access to the actual YAML file content, I will parse it and attempt to extract the most deeply nested objects that are neither lists nor dictionaries, despite these potential obstacles.
