Handling these requires additional logic to ensure that the referenced data is correctly interpreted.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Indentation**: The indentation level is significant in YAML and must be consistent. However, files with inconsistent indentation might lead to parsing errors or incorrect interpretation of the structure.\n\n6. **Scalar Values with Special Characters**: Scalar values (strings, for instance) in YAML can include characters that could be mistaken for list or dict delimiters (like `:` or `-`) if not properly parsed.\n\n7. **Large Files and Performance**: If the YAML file is very large, performance may become an issue when parsing and recursively searching for the most deeply nested objects.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a robust parsing strategy will be needed to traverse the YAML structure, maintain the current depth level, and correctly identify leaf nodes (scalar values) that are not lists or dictionaries."
