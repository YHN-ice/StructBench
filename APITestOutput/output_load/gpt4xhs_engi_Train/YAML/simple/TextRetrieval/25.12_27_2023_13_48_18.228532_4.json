This might require auxiliary data structures or algorithms to compare depths.\n\n3. **Handling Lists and Dictionaries**: You will need to differentiate between lists and dictionaries since the question specifies that values should not be of type list or dict. You should only consider scalar values (strings, integers, booleans, etc.) or null values as the most deeply nested objects.\n\n4. **Output Formatting**: The expected output format is specific; excerpts should appear as they do in the original YAML file, separated by a newline character `\\n\\n`. This means you'll need to preserve the context while isolating the deepest objects.\n\n5. **YAML Specific Syntax**: YAML syntax includes various features like anchors and aliases, multi-line strings, and more. Your parser needs to handle these correctly to not misinterpret the structure.\n\n6. **Potential Ambiguities**: If there are multiple paths with the same maximum depth, you would need to decide if all are to be returned or only a unique set.\n\n7. **Performance**: For large YAML files, performance can be a concern.
