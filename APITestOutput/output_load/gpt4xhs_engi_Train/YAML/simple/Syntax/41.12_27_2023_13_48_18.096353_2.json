Here are the issues:\n\n1. **Colon without a key**: At the end of the YAML content, there are colons (`:h`, `:i`, `:j`) that do not have corresponding keys. This is incorrect because in YAML, colons are used to separate keys from values in key-value pairs.\n2. **Improper Indentation**: The colons that are presented without keys (`:h`, `:i`, `:j`) also have indentation issues.
