Improper indentation: YAML relies on indentation for structure, where spaces are used (not tabs) to nest elements. Each level of nesting should consistently use the same number of spaces.\n\n2. Incorrect key-value pairs: In YAML, key-value pairs are denoted with a colon followed by a space. Missing a colon or space can cause an error.\n\n3. Sequences/lists formatting: Items in a list should be denoted with a hyphen followed by a space. Improper formatting of list items can lead to errors.\n\n4. Scalar formatting: Multi-line strings or scalars can be represented using various styles like literal block (using `|`) or folded block (using `>`). Errors can occur if these styles are not used correctly.\n\n5. Duplicate keys: Keys within the same map must be unique; duplicate keys can cause errors.\n\n6. Incompatible data types: YAML parsers might throw errors if an expected data type (e.g., integer, boolean) does not match the provided value.\n\n7. Use of reserved indicators without proper quoting: Characters such as `:`, `@`, `%`, `!`, etc., have special meanings in YAML and should be quoted if used in values.\n\nNow, please provide the YAML file so that I can check for any structural errors."
