A space must follow the colon.\n\n3. Invalid mapping value indicators:\n   The lines containing just `:m`, `:n`, and `:o` are incorrect because they suggest a key without a value and are not indented correctly within the hierarchy.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the YAML, without commas and with correct spacing:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"r\"\nZ: k\nsubs:\n  - id: \"s\"\n    Y: j\n    subs:\n      - id: \"t\"\n        X: i\n        subs: []\n```\n\nNote that I've removed the invalid lines `:m`, `:n`, and `:o`.
