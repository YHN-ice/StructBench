Syntax Errors: This includes incorrect usage of colons, dashes, quotes, or any other special characters that have a specific meaning in YAML.\n\n3. Mapping Errors: Key-value pairs must be properly mapped with a colon followed by space. Nested mappings must be correctly indented.\n\n4. Sequence/List Errors: Lists should start with a dash and a space. Nested lists must be correctly indented.\n\n5. Scalars, Blocks, and Flow Styles: Misuse of block styles (using `|` or `>`) or flow styles (encapsulated by `{}` for mappings and `[]` for sequences) can result in errors.\n\n6. Duplicate Keys: Each key in a mapping must be unique. If there are duplicate keys, it may cause an error or unexpected behavior.\n\n7.
