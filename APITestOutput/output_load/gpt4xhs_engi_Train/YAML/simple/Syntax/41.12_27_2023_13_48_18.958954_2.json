Each level of nesting should be consistently indented with spaces (not tabs).\n\n2. Incorrect scalar formatting: Scalars (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans) need to be formatted correctly. Strings with special characters should be quoted, and booleans and numbers need to follow YAML’s conventions.\n\n3. Sequences and mappings: Lists (sequences) and dictionaries (mappings) need to be correctly defined with dashes for lists and colons for key-value pairs in dictionaries.\n\n4. Duplicate keys: In a mapping, keys must be unique.\n\n5. Missing or extraneous characters: Characters such as colons, dashes, brackets, and braces must be used accurately to represent the data structures intended.\n\n6. Complex structures: Nested structures can become complex, and maintaining the correct indentation and structure becomes more challenging.\n\n7. Special characters in keys or strings: If special characters are used in strings or keys, they may need to be enclosed in quotes to be parsed correctly.\n\n8. Use of reserved indicators: Characters such as `%`, `@`, `&`, `*`, `!`, `|`, `>`, `<`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `,`, `#`, `?` have special meanings in YAML and their use may lead to parsing errors if not used properly.\n\nI will be looking for these types of issues when parsing the provided YAML file.
