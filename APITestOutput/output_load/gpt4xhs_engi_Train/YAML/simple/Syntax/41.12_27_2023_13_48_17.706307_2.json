Indentation errors - YAML relies heavily on indentation to define structure, using spaces to nest elements within a hierarchy. Improper indentation can lead to a structure that is not parsed as intended.\n\n2. Incorrect use of data structures - YAML allows for the use of scalars (e.g., strings, numbers), lists (arrays), and dictionaries (hashes/maps). Mixing these incorrectly or failing to adhere to the expected formats can cause errors.\n\n3. Syntax errors - For example, forgetting to place a space after a colon in a key-value pair, using tabs instead of spaces for indentation, or not correctly matching quotes for string values can result in a syntax error.\n\n4. Duplicate keys - In YAML dictionaries or maps, keys must be unique. If there are duplicate keys, it might cause an error or the parser might ignore or overwrite the first occurrence with the second one.\n\n5. Parsing of special characters - Special characters or sequences in strings, such as `:`, `-`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, must be correctly handled, sometimes requiring quotes around the string.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll be able to determine if any of these errors are present."
