Inconsistent or incorrect indentation can result in structural errors.\n\n2. Data Type Confusion: YAML is sensitive to data types, and confusion between strings, integers, booleans, or other types can lead to errors if not properly indicated.\n\n3. Syntax Issues: Incorrect use of hyphens for lists, colons for mappings, or other syntax elements can lead to errors.\n\n4. Missing or Extra Spaces: Spaces are significant in YAML. A missing space after a colon in a key-value pair or extra spaces where they are not expected can cause problems.\n\n5. Invalid Characters: Certain characters may need to be escaped or quoted to be interpreted correctly.\n\n6.
