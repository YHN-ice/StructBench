Missing colons or spaces can lead to errors.\n\n4. **Duplicated Keys**: In a YAML file, keys within the same block should be unique. Duplicate keys are usually not allowed.\n\n5. **Syntax Mistakes**: Characters like `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `,`, `&`, `*`, `#`, `?`, `|`, `-`, `:` must be used correctly according to YAML syntax rules.\n\n6. **Scalar Content Issues**: Scalars (basic, single-value data) must be formatted correctly. For instance, if a scalar contains special characters, it may need to be enclosed in quotes.\n\n7. **Improper Use of Complex Structures**: Lists and dictionaries need to be formatted correctly using `-` for list items and using key-value pairs for dictionaries.\n\n8. **Incorrect Handling of Multiline Strings**: Multiline strings have specific formatting rules, such as using `|` for literal blocks or `>` for folded blocks.\n\nPlease provide the YAML content so that I can check for any structural errors."
