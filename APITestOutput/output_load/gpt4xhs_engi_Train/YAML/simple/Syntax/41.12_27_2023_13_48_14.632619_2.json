The amount of space used for indentation matters, and it must be consistent throughout the document.\n2. **Tabs vs Spaces:** YAML files should use spaces for indentation, not tabs. Using tabs can cause parsing errors.\n3. **Key-Value Pairs:** Every key should be followed by a colon and a space before its value.\n4. **Data Types:** Scalars, sequences, and mappings need to be correctly identified and used. For example, lists should start with a dash and a space, and keys in a mapping should not have duplicate names.\n5. **Complex Data Structures:** When dealing with nested structures, it's important to maintain proper alignment and hierarchy.\n6. **Special Characters:** Certain characters have special meanings in YAML, such as the hash (#) for comments. These need to be handled correctly within the context.\n7. **Hyphens and Lists:** List items are expected to be preceded by a hyphen and a space. Each list item must also align at the correct indentation level.\n8. **Multi-line Strings:** There are specific indicators for multi-line strings (like `|` for literal block scalars and `>` for folded block scalars) which must be used correctly.\n\nUpon receiving the YAML input, I will check for these and any other structural issues that may be present in order to determine whether the file contains errors."
