Unlike languages that use braces or brackets to define object boundaries, YAML uses spaces (typically two or four per indentation level). Indentation must be consistent throughout the document.\n\n2. **Tabs vs Spaces**: YAML does not allow tabs for indentation; only spaces are permitted. If tabs are used, it can lead to parsing errors.\n\n3. **Key-Value Pair Issues**: Each key-value pair should be separated by a colon followed by a space. Missing colons or spaces can result in a malformed file.\n\n4. **Data Types and Quotations**: Strings in YAML don't always require quotations, but if they include certain special characters, they need to be quoted. Also, numbers and booleans should not be quoted unless they are intended to be treated as strings.\n\n5. **Hyphens for Lists**: Lists in YAML are denoted with hyphens, and the items should align with the first hyphen following the indentation level of the list.\n\n6. **Duplicated Keys**: Each key within a map must be unique; duplicate keys are not allowed.\n\n7. **Flow Control Characters**: Characters such as `{}`, `[]`, and `,` can be used in YAML, but they need to be used correctly if adopting flow style representation.\n\n8. **Multiline Strings**: There are specific ways to define multiline strings using `|` for literal blocks or `>` for folded blocks. Incorrect usage or indentation can lead to errors.\n\n9. **Document Start and End Markers**: Although optional, if used, the document start marker `---` and end marker `...` must be used correctly.\n\n10. **Complex Structures**: Nested structures can sometimes lead to confusion and mistakes if not properly aligned or if the relationship between elements isn't clearly defined with correct indentation.\n\nAny of these issues can cause structural errors in a YAML file.
