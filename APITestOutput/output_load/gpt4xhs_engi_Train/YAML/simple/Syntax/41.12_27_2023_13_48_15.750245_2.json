Incorrect indentation can lead to errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n2. **Tabs vs Spaces**: YAML does not allow tabs for indentation; only spaces are permitted. Using tabs can cause errors.\n\n3. **Key-Value Pairs**: Every key-value pair must have a key followed by a colon and a space before the value.\n\n4. **Data Types**: YAML automatically detects data types, and incorrect representation can lead to wrong data types being inferred (e.g., a string that looks like a number).\n\n5. **Dashes for Lists**: Lists are denoted by dashes (`-`). A common mistake is to forget the dash or to incorrectly indent list items.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structures**: Nested structures can create confusion, and if not properly defined, can result in errors.\n\n7. **Scalars, Blocks, and Folded Text**: Multiline strings have special notations (like `|` for block format and `>` for folded format), which can be mistaken.\n\n8. **Anchors and Aliases**: The use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) for repeating content must be correct; otherwise, they can cause issues.\n\n9. **Directives and Reserved Indicators**: Characters such as `%`, `---`, and `...` have special meanings in YAML, and their misuse can introduce errors.\n\n10. **Comments**: Comments start with `#`, and placing them incorrectly (for example, inline without proper spacing) can cause items to be ignored or errors to be thrown.\n\nPlease share the YAML content so that I can check for potential structural errors."
