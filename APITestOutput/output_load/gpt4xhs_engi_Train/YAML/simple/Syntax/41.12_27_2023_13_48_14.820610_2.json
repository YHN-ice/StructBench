Unintended interpretation could happen if not properly quoted or formatted.\n5. **Lists and Dictionaries**: Errors might arise from improperly formatted lists (sequences) or dictionaries (mappings).\n6. **Duplicate Keys**: Having duplicate keys in a mapping is not allowed and would be considered an error.\n7. **Syntax Symbols**: Special characters like `:`, `-`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]` must be used correctly according to YAML syntax.\n8. **Flow Style vs Block Style**: Errors might occur if there's a mix-up or incorrect usage of block style (indentation based) and flow style (JSON-like, comma-separated) structures.\n\nOnce the above points are checked and validated against the YAML file, it would be possible to ascertain whether there are any structural errors.
