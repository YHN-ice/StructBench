        "Based on the YAML-like structure provided in the input, it seems you are looking for the first object's `id` within the `subs` list. Since the YAML content is not properly formatted for parsing here, let's assume that the `subs` list is part of a larger YAML object. With the corrected indentation, it would look like this in proper YAML format:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"e\"\nZ: d\nsubs:\n  - id: \"f\"\n    Y: c\n    subs:\n      - id: \"g\"\n        X: b\n        subs: []\n```\n\nIn this case, the first object's `id` within the `subs` list is `\"f\"`. So the answer to your question is `f`.\n\nPlease note that YAML is sensitive to indentation, so proper formatting is crucial when working with YAML files.
