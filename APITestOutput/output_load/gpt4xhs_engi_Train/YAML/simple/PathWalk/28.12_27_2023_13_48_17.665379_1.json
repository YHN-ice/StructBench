When parsing a YAML file to find the first object's id of an array named `subs`, there are a few potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Indentation Sensitivity**: YAML relies heavily on indentation to define its structure. If the indentation is not consistent or correct, it could lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the data hierarchy.\n   \n2. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types, such as strings, numbers, arrays, and dictionaries. Ensuring that the `subs` key is indeed an array and that the objects within it have an `id` attribute is essential.\n\n3. **Correct Key Identification**: There could be multiple keys with similar names, or the key `subs` could be nested at different levels of the hierarchy. Identifying the correct key matching the question's context is crucial.\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows for the use of aliases and anchors to reuse common settings. If these are used in the file, they need to be appropriately resolved to access the actual data.\n\n5. **File Size and Complexity**: Large files with complex structures can make it more challenging to locate specific data. Efficiently navigating the hierarchy to find the first object in `subs` is important.\n\n6. **External References**: If the YAML file references external files or includes custom tags, this might complicate parsing as additional processing would be necessary to resolve these references.\n\n7. **Errors in the File**: Syntax errors, missing keys, duplicate keys, or invalid values could all lead to issues when trying to parse the file and extract the requested information.\n\n8. **Versioning**: YAML has different versions with slightly different features and syntax rules. Ensuring compatibility with the version of the YAML at hand is necessary.\n\nOnce you provide the input YAML file, I can proceed with parsing it while keeping these potential issues in mind to accurately determine the first object's id within the `subs` array."
