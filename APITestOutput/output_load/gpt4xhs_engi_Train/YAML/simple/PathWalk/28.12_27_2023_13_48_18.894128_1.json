Here are some potential obstacles that we may encounter:\n\n1. Nested structures: YAML allows for complex nested structures, and without knowing the exact hierarchy, it's challenging to determine what counts as the \"first object\" of `subs`.\n\n2. Lists and dictionaries: If `subs` is a list, we would need to know whether it contains dictionaries (i.e., objects with key-value pairs) or other data types, and in which order they appear.\n\n3. Key naming: YAML keys are case-sensitive. If `subs` or `id` are not consistently named or have unexpected capitalization, it might be difficult to locate the correct elements.\n\n4. Multi-document files: YAML can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If `subs` appears in different documents, we need to know which document to consider.\n\n5. Anchors and aliases: YAML supports anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`), which can create references to other parts of the file. If `id` is referenced rather than explicitly stated, it might be necessary to resolve these references.\n\n6. Comments: YAML supports comments, starting with `#`. We have to differentiate between actual data items and comments.\n\nWithout the file, we can only speculate on these difficulties. Please provide the content of the YAML file or any additional context needed to accurately parse the requested information."
