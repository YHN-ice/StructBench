Improper indentation can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors to reference other parts of the document, which can complicate the retrieval of information if not handled properly.\n4. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types like scalars, sequences, and mappings.
