Any ambiguity in indentation or formatting might cause difficulties in parsing the file correctly.\n\n3. **Variations in Key Names**: YAML keys are case-sensitive and can vary in naming conventions (e.g., `ID`, `id`, `Id`). This could lead to confusion if the exact key name is not given or there is inconsistency in naming.\n\n4. **Aliases and References**: YAML supports the use of aliases and references that can make it hard to determine what the actual \"first object\" within a list is without fully resolving these references.\n\n5. **Implicit Type Conversion**: YAML automatically detects and converts data types based on the content. If the \"id\" is not clearly identifiable as a string or number, there might be some uncertainty in interpreting the data.\n\n6. **Size of the File**: If the YAML file is particularly large, finding the required information may be time-consuming and require careful navigation through the file.\n\n7. **Multiple Documents**: YAML allows for multiple documents to be included in a single file, separated by `---`. If this is the case, it would be necessary to identify in which document the \"subs\" key is located.\n\n8. **Inclusion of Directives or Tags**: If the file makes use of advanced YAML features like directives or custom tags, it might add a layer of complexity to simply parsing for an object's id.\n\nOnce I have access to the YAML file, I'll be able to identify which of these obstacles are present and address them to provide the correct answer to your question."
