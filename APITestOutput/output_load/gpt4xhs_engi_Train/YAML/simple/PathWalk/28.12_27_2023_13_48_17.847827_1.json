If the `subs` array or its first object is referenced through an alias, we must resolve this reference properly to get the correct `id`.\n\n3. **Data Variations:** The `subs` array could be empty, or the objects within it might not have an `id` property. There could also be variations in the capitalization or spelling of `id` (`ID`, `Id`, etc.), which needs to be accounted for.\n\n4. **Inheritance and Overriding:** YAML allows for inheritance-like features with the use of anchors and extending properties. The actual values of some properties, such as `id`, can be affected by such mechanisms.\n\n5. **Syntactical Errors:** The YAML file could contain syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or invalid characters, which might make it impossible to parse without fixing these issues first.\n\n6. **Incorrect Data Types:** Even if everything else is correct, if the `id` is expected to be a string but is provided as a different data type (such as a number or a list), this can lead to incorrect interpretations unless handled properly.\n\n7. **Large File Size:** If the YAML file is very large, it could pose difficulties in terms of processing time and memory usage for the parser.\n\nAfter sharing these potential obstacles, please provide the YAML file so I can proceed with parsing it and answer your question regarding the `id` of the first object in the `subs` array."
