If the \"subs\" section uses these features, it might complicate identifying the actual data.\n\n4. **Type interpretation**: YAML allows implicit typing based on the value format. Ensuring that the \"id\" is correctly interpreted as a string or a numeric value might be necessary, depending on how it's formatted.\n\n5. **Variations and versions**: There are different versions of YAML (1.1, 1.2, etc.), and some constructs might be interpreted differently depending on the version.\n\n6. **Errors in the YAML file**: If the YAML file isn't well-formed (e.g., missing indentation, incorrect use of hyphens for lists), it could prevent proper parsing.\n\n7. **Large file size**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be difficult to quickly find the relevant section without search capabilities or an understanding of the file's structure.\n\nOnce we see the actual YAML content, we'll be able to determine which obstacles, if any, are present and need to be addressed to answer your question."
