If the input file contains syntax errors or incorrect indentation, it may not be parsed correctly, making it difficult to extract the required information.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the YAML file is very large, it could be cumbersome to manually search for the relevant sections, and there might be performance considerations when parsing the file programmatically.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Key Names**: Sometimes, key names might be inconsistent (e.g., \"id\" vs. \"ID\" vs. \"Id\"). This could make it difficult to locate the correct key without knowing the exact naming convention used in the file.\n\n6. **Data Type Issues**: YAML supports various data types. If \"id\" is expected to be a string but is not quoted in the file, or if it's interpreted as another data type, this could lead to confusion when trying to retrieve it.\n\n7. **Hidden or Encrypted Data**: In some cases, data within the YAML file could be obfuscated or encrypted, requiring additional steps to retrieve the actual value.\n\n8. **External References**: YAML supports anchors and aliases, which can reference other parts of the document. If the \"id\" field uses such references, one would need to resolve these to get the actual value.\n\nNow, please provide the YAML file content so that I can parse it and answer your question regarding the first object's id of subs."
