If the `subs` section uses these, it may be necessary to resolve them to find the first object's `id`.\n\n3. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`.

This requires careful attention to the exact key name used in the file.\n\n5. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types. Ensuring that the `id` is interpreted correctly, whether it's a string, number, or another type, is important.\n\n6. **Comments and Formatting**: YAML supports comments, which may contain misleading information that should be disregarded when parsing.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: If the YAML file contains syntax errors, parsing might fail or result in incorrect data.\n\nPlease provide the YAML content so that I can accurately parse it and answer your question."
