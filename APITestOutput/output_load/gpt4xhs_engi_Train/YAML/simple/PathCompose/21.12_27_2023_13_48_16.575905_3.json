Lists are accessed via indices (numerical positions) while dictionaries are accessed via keys.\n\n4. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types like strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, dates, etc. It's important to ensure that the access path corresponds to the data type that is expected at each level.\n\n5. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows defining complex data structures using anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`).
