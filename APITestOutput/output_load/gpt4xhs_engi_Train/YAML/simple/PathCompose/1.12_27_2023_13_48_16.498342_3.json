Depending on the parser, this might affect how keys are accessed (e.g., treating a numeric key as an integer or a string).\n\n6. **Special Characters in Keys:** If keys contain special characters or spaces, they might require different handling or quoting within the access path.\n\n7. **Document Separators:** A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`.
