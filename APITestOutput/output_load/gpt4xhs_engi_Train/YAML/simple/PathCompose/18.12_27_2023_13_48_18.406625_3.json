        "Based on the provided input, which appears to be a YAML structure that has been roughly outlined, you could access the value \"zy\" by understanding the hierarchy and types of collections the data is nested within.

Start with the top-level object (which would be the root object in a parsed YAML file, let's call it `obj`).\n2. Move to the `subs` key, which contains a list, so access the first element of this list (index 0).\n3. Within this element, you can directly access the key `Y`, which holds the value \"zy\".\n\nPutting this together into the format you requested:\n\n```plaintext\nobj['subs'][0]['Y']\n```\n\nThis implies that `obj` is your top-level dictionary that results from parsing the YAML content, `'subs'` is the key for the sublist, `[0]` selects the first item in that list (where ID is `\"p\"`), and `'Y'` is the key for the value \"zy\" within that dictionary."
