Nested Structure: YAML files often contain nested structures, which could include dictionaries, lists, or a combination of both. Understanding the hierarchy and traversing it correctly to reach the desired value is essential.\n\n2. Key Names: YAML is case-sensitive, and key names may have spaces, special characters, or similar-sounding names. Ensuring the correct key is used to access the value is crucial.\n\n3. Indentation: YAML relies on indentation to determine the structure. Improper indentation can lead to parsing errors or incorrect data retrieval.\n\n4. Data Types: YAML supports various data types like strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, dates, etc. Identifying the correct data type of the value you're trying to access is important.\n\n5. Anchors and Aliases: YAML allows for the definition of anchors (&) and aliases (*) to reuse content within the document. If the value is referenced through an alias, it may require understanding where the anchor is defined.\n\n6. Scalars and Collections: Understanding whether the value is a scalar (single value), a sequence (list), or a mapping (dictionary) will determine how to access it.\n\n7. Variations in YAML Versions: Different versions of YAML may have slight differences in features and syntax, which could affect how the file should be parsed.\n\n8. File Size and Complexity: Large or complex YAML files can make it more challenging to find and access particular pieces of data due to the volume of information.\n\n9. External References: YAML files may include external references that need to be resolved before accessing certain values.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one needs to carefully read and understand the structure of the YAML file, pay attention to indentation and keys, and use proper methods for traversing nested structures. Additionally, being familiar with YAML syntax and conventions is helpful."
