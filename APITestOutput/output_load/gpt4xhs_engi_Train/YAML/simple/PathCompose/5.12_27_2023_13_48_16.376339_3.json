It's important not to confuse these with keys in a map.\n\n7. **Reference & Anchors**: YAML allows defining references with anchors and aliases, which can complicate direct access if not resolved properly.\n\n8. **Indentation Sensitivity**: YAML relies heavily on indentation to define structure; incorrect indentation can lead to misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n9. **Version Differences**: There are different versions of YAML (1.1, 1.2), and some features may behave differently across versions.\n\nUnderstanding these potential challenges will aid in accurately navigating the YAML structure to retrieve the desired value.
