Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Nested Structures**: YAML files can contain nested structures such as arrays within arrays or dictionaries within dictionaries. Understanding the hierarchy and navigating deeply nested structures can be challenging.\n\n2. **Keys with Special Characters**: YAML keys can include special characters, spaces, or reserved words, which might require special handling or quoting.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Indentation**: YAML relies heavily on indentation to represent the structure of the data. Inconsistent indentation can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the data hierarchy.\n\n4. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types like strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, dates, etc. Ensuring that the correct data type is interpreted and accessed properly can be a challenge.\n\n5. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows for the use of aliases and anchors to avoid repetition. Understanding and resolving these references is crucial for accurate parsing.\n\n6. **Multiline Strings**: YAML supports multiline strings which can complicate parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n7. **Variable Substitution**: In some cases, YAML might include variables that need to be substituted with actual values, which requires an additional processing step.\n\n8. **Directives and Tags**: YAML files may contain directives and tags that affect how the content should be parsed or represented.\n\nUnderstanding these potential challenges is important for correctly parsing a YAML file and accurately accessing a specific value within its structure.

Assuming the top-level object is assigned to a variable called `obj`, the access path would be:\n\n```\nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]\n```\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- `obj`: The top-level object.\n- `[\"subs\"]`: Accesses the `subs` array within the top-level object.\n- `[0]`: Accesses the first item (object with `id: \"m\"`) in the `subs` array.\n- `[\"Y\"]`: Accesses the value of key `\"Y\"` in the nested object, which is `\"zy\"`.\n\nSo, to answer your question, you would use the following key/index access path to get `\"zy\"`:\n\n```\nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"Y\"]\n```"
