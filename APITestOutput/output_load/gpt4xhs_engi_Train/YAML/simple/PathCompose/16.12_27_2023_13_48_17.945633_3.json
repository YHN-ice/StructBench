However, based on the given structure, it appears that you're looking to access a nested value with the ID \"w\". Assuming that the provided structure would be correctly formatted in YAML, we would have something like this:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"v\"\nZ: x\nsubs:\n  - id: \"w\"\n    Y: w\n    subs:\n      - id: \"x\"\n        X: v\n        subs: []\n```\n\nIn a typical Python data structure parsed from the YAML content (using a library like `PyYAML`), it would look something like a list of dictionaries.

Assuming the variable `obj` holds the parsed YAML content, the access path would look like this:\n\n```python\nvalue_w = obj['subs'][0]['Y']\n```\n\nHowever, without proper YAML formatting and a clear understanding of the top-level structure, this is only a best guess. If `obj` is indeed the top-level dictionary containing key-value pairs of the parsed YAML, and 'subs' is a list of dictionaries each containing an 'id', then the above access method should work to get the value associated with 'Y', which is \"w\"."
