Nested structure: YAML allows for complex nested structures, including lists and dictionaries. Understanding the hierarchy and navigating through it correctly is crucial.\n\n2. Key ambiguity: Sometimes, keys in a YAML file might not be unique, or they might be case-sensitive, which can lead to confusion if not handled properly.\n\n3. Indentation errors: YAML relies heavily on indentation to define structure. Improper indentation can cause parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n4. Data types: YAML supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, lists, and dictionaries. Ensuring that you're accessing the right type (and casting if necessary) is important.\n\n5. Aliases and anchors: YAML allows defining an anchor for a node and later using an alias to refer back to it. This can complicate the process of accessing a value if not managed correctly.\n\n6. Multi-document support: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. Ensuring you're working within the correct document is crucial.\n\n7. Implicit vs. explicit data types: YAML can interpret data types implicitly based on the content, which might lead to unexpected types unless explicitly defined.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would need to carefully understand the structure of the given YAML file, pay attention to indentation, handle data types appropriately, and navigate through the hierarchy step by step to access the desired value."

        "Based on the structure of the input provided, which seems to be a YAML-like structure, we want to access the value \"c\".
