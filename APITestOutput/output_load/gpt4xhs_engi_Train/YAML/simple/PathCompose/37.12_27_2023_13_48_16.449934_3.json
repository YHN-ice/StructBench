Mistaking the index can lead to the wrong value being accessed.\n\n4. **Type Casting:** The values in YAML files can be strings, numbers, booleans, etc. Ensuring that the value is accessed and interpreted with the correct type is important.\n\n5. **Special Characters in Keys:** If keys contain special characters or spaces, they may need to be handled differently (e.g., quoted) in the access path.\n\n6. **YAML Syntax Specifics:** YAML is sensitive to indentation and formatting.
