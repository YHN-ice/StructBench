Navigating this can be tricky.\n\n6. **Indentation:** YAML relies on indentation for its structure; incorrect indentation can lead to misinterpretation of the hierarchy level of various elements.\n\n7. **Similar Keys:** There might be similarly named keys in different parts of the YAML structure; care must be taken to follow the correct path.\n\nAfter taking these into account, I will need to see the actual YAML input to give you the correct path to access the value \"y\"."
