This feature might complicate direct key access since you'd need to resolve the reference first.\n\n6. **Syntactical Errors**: If there's a syntactical error in the YAML file, it could pose problems for parsing and accessing the data.\n\n7. **Whitespace Sensitivity**: YAML is whitespace-sensitive (indentation is used to denote structure), so incorrect indentation could lead to misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\nOnce you provide me with the YAML file content, I'll be able to give you precise instructions on how to access the desired value."
