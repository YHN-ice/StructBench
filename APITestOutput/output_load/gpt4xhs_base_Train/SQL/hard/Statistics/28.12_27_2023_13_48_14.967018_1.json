Here are the relevant entries:\n\n- c: employed with a salary of 795630\n- i: employed with a salary of 837636\n- j: employed with a salary of 558962 (this is not more than 568319, so we don't count this person)\n- n: employed with a salary of 573952\n\nTherefore, there are 3 people who are employed and have a salary of more than 568319."
