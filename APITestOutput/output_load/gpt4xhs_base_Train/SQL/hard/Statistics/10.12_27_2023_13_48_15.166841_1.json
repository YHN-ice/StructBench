(this salary does not exceed the threshold)\n- Person i (male, 36 years old) is employed with a salary of 700241 at Twitter in CA.\n- Person l (female, 62 years old) is employed with a salary of 254425 at Microsoft in WA. (this salary does not exceed the threshold)\n\nNow we count the number of people whose salaries exceed 629705:\n\n1. Person a's salary: 693308\n2. Person c's salary: 764223\n3. Person i's salary: 700241\n\nTherefore, the number of people who are employed with a salary of more than 629705 is three."
