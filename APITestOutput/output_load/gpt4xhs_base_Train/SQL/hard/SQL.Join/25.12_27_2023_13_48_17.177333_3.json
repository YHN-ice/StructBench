        "To determine how many people who work in Illinois (IL) are taller than 154 cm, we need to identify which individuals are employed (since the question specifies \"people who work\") and are located in Illinois. Then, we will count the number of these individuals whose height is greater than 154 cm.\n\nBased on the data provided, the \"location\" column does not list Illinois (IL) for any individuals; instead, we see other state abbreviations such as HI, TX, CA, WA, GA, and NY. Therefore, based on the given data, there are no individuals who work in Illinois.\n\nHowever, if you are considering a typographical error in the question and meant to refer to the state abbreviations provided in the input data, please provide the correct state abbreviation or clarify if any of the provided locations should be considered as Illinois.\n\nIf we still proceed with counting people taller than 154 cm regardless of their location but considering only those who are employed, we find:\n\n- a (height 207) - Not employed\n- b (height 122) - Not employed\n- c (height 200) - Employed\n- d (height 189) - Not employed\n- e (height 143) - Not employed\n- f (height 127) - Employed\n- g (height 127) - Employed\n- h (height 210) - Not employed\n- i (height 161) - Not employed\n- j (height 165) - Employed\n- k (height 196) - Employed\n- l (height 151) - Not employed\n\nOut of the employed individuals:\n- c (height 200)\n- f (height 127) - Not taller than 154 cm\n- g (height 127) - Not taller than 154 cm\n- j (height 165)\n- k (height 196)\n\nSo, there are 3 people who are employed and taller than 154 cm based on this data, disregarding their location since IL is not listed."
