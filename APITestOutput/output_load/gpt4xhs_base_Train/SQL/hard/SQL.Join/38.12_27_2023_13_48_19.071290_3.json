        "To find out how many people who work in NY are taller than 169 cm, we need to filter the data based on three conditions:\n\n1. The person's height should be greater than 169 cm.\n2. The person's employment status should be 'employed' (since the question asks for people who work).\n3. The location of the person's company should be in NY (New York).\n\nLet's look at the provided data for these conditions:\n\n- Person c: Male, height 178 cm, unemployed, company location HI (Hawaii) → Does not meet the employment and location criteria.\n- Person g: Female, height 159 cm, employed, company location TX (Texas) → Does not meet the height criteria.\n- Person h: Male, height 149 cm, employed, company location TX (Texas) → Does not meet the height criteria.\n- Person j: Female, height 138 cm, employed, company location WA (Washington) → Does not meet the height criteria.\n- Person k: Female, height 195 cm, employed, company location WA (Washington) → Does not meet the location criteria.\n\nBased on the given data and our filters, there are no employed individuals who are taller than 169 cm and work in NY. The only person working in NY is person b and they are unemployed. Thus the answer is zero."
