They must work in WA.\n2. Their height must be greater than 152 centimeters.\n\nLet's go through the data and identify individuals who meet both criteria.\n\n- Individual e is employed at Google with a location of WA and has a height of 163 cm.\n- Individual g is unemployed but associated with Microsoft with a location of WA and has a height of 206 cm.\n\nBased on the given data, there are 2 individuals (e and g) who work in WA and are taller than 152 centimeters. It's important to note that we are considering \"unemployed\" status as still being related to working in WA since the company location for individual g is listed as WA."
