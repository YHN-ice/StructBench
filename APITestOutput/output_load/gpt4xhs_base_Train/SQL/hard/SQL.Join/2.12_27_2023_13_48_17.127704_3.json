The person's height should be greater than 173 cm.\n\nBased on the given input, let's apply these criteria:\n\n- Person i is retired (therefore, not currently working), with a location in CA, and a height of 134 cm.\n- Person j is unemployed (therefore, not currently working), with a location in CA, and a height of 204 cm.\n\nFrom the list provided, only person j is located in CA and has a height greater than 173 cm. However, since person j is unemployed, they do not meet the criteria of currently working in CA. \n\nThus, the number of people who work in CA and are taller than 173 cm is 0."
