        "To find out how many people who work in Georgia (GA) are taller than 158 cm, we need to look at the provided data and filter the individuals based on two criteria:\n\n1. They are employed (which means they work).\n2. Their height is greater than 158 cm.\n\nHowever, there is no location information as \"GA\" given in the provided data; instead, we have location abbreviations like \"WA,\" \"IL,\" \"TX,\" \"CA,\" \"NY,\" and \"HI.\" If we assume you meant any location (and not specifically GA), then we will proceed without considering locations at all. If you specifically meant Georgia (GA), then unfortunately, we cannot proceed as there is no such data available.\n\nWith the assumption that we are considering all locations, let's filter for employed individuals taller than 158 cm:\n\n1. d female 48 l 191 102 white - Employed and taller than 158 cm\n2. e male 41 m 218 76 olive - Employed and taller than 158 cm\n3. f female 22 n 167 79 olive - Employed and taller than 158 cm\n4. g male 49 o 188 101 swarthy - Employed and taller than 158 cm (But listed as retired)\n5. j female 13 r 168 166 olive - Employed and taller than 158 cm\n6. k male 10 s 143 153 brown - Employed but not taller than 158 cm\n7. l female 32 t 145 118 brown - Employed but not taller than 158 cm\n8. n female 14 v 216 134 swarthy - Employed and taller than 158 cm\n\nAccording to this list, there are five individuals who are both employed and taller than 158 cm (excluding \"g\" since he is retired).
