        "To answer the question \"How many people who work in WA are taller than 179?\", we need to filter the given information based on two criteria:\n\n1. The person must be employed (since we're looking for people who work).\n2. The height of the person must be greater than 179.\n\nAdditionally, we're looking for people specifically in WA, which likely refers to Washington state. However, in the given information, there is no location with 'WA'. All listed locations are different states. Therefore, assuming 'WA' was intended to be 'work', we will consider the employment status instead.\n\nFrom the provided data, we'll go through each record and count only those who are both employed and have a height greater than 179. Let's examine the data:\n\n- a (male, 28, k): Height is 204, but he is retired (not working).\n- b (female, 15, l): Height is 200, but she is unemployed (not working).\n- c (female, 53, m): Height is 149 and employed, but her height is below 179.\n- d (male, 54, n): Height is 199 and employed, so he meets both criteria.\n- e (male, 55, o): Height is 135 and unemployed (not working).\n- f (male, 49, p): Height is 216 and employed, so he meets both criteria.\n- g (male, 35, q): Height is 211 but he is retired (not working).\n- h (male, 30, r): Height is 189 and unemployed (not working).\n- i (male, 39, s): Height is 143 and retired (not working).\n- j (male, 68, t): Height is 167 and retired (not working).\n- k (male, 41, u): Height is 163 and retired (not working).\n\nBased on this examination, only two people meet both criteria of being employed and having a height greater than 179: \n1. Person d\n2. Person f\n\nTherefore, the number of people who work and are taller than 179 is 2. However, if you specifically meant they needed to work in Washington state (WA), we cannot determine the answer from the given information as there's no mention of 'WA' in the location field."
