Their status is \"employed\".\n2. Their location is \"HI\" (Hawaii).\n3. Their height is greater than 170 cm.\n\nLooking at the provided input, we can filter out the rows that do not meet these criteria:\n\n- Person b is unemployed.\n- Person f is retired.\n- Person i is unemployed.\n- Person k is unemployed.\n\nNone of the individuals listed as working in HI are employed; they are either retired or unemployed.
