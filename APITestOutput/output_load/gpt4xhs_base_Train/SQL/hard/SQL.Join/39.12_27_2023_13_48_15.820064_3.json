From the provided data, we need to look at the \"location\" and \"height\" columns and count the number of entries that satisfy both conditions.\n\nLet's go through the list:\n\n- primeKey j: Employed at Microsoft in WA with a height of 151 cm (does not meet the height requirement).\n- primeKey k: Retired at Twitter in WA with a height of 163 cm (meets both requirements).\n- primeKey n: Retired at OPENAI in WA with a height of 213 cm (meets both requirements).\n\nAmong the people listed, only primeKey k and primeKey n satisfy both criteria. So, there are 2 people who work in WA and are taller than 162 cm."
