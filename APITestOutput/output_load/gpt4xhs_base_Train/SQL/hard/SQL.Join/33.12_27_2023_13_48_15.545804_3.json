This individual is marked as \"unemployed\". Since the question asks for the number of people \"who work in HI\" and are taller than 177 cm, and the only person in HI is unemployed, there are no workers in HI to consider based on this data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there are 0 people who work in HI and are taller than 177 cm according to the provided data."
