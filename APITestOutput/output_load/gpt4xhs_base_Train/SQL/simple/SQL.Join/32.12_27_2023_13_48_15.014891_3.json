        "To determine how many people who work in Washington (WA) are taller than 155, we need to look at the given dataset and identify the individuals who meet two criteria:\n\n1. They must be employed (since the question specifies \"people who work\").\n2. Their height must be greater than 155.\n\nBased on the provided input, here are the steps to find the answer:\n\n1. Find the individuals who are employed.\n2. Check if their height is greater than 155.\n3. Check if their location is WA (Washington).\n4. Count the number of individuals who satisfy all three criteria.\n\nLooking at the input data, I see location codes like GA, NY, TX, and IL, but there is no mention of WA (Washington). Therefore, based on the given information, there are no records of people working in Washington (WA).\n\nHowever, if you're asking about people working at any location, and the \"WA\" in your question is a typo or not specifically indicating Washington state, we can still find the number of employed individuals taller than 155:\n\n- Person f with a height of 142 does not meet the height criterion.\n- Other individuals either do not have their employment status listed or are unemployed/retired.\n\nSo if we ignore the location requirement (as there is no WA mentioned), there is no one in this dataset who is both employed and taller than 155. If there's a potential typo or misunderstanding about the location code \"WA,\" please clarify so I can provide the correct information."
