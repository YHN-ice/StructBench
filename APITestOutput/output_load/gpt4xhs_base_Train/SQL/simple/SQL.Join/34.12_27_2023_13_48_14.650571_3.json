Therefore, the number of people who work in Georgia (GA) and are taller than 171 cm is zero.\n\nHowever, if you mistakenly used \"GA\" to refer to \"employed\" individuals rather than specifically referring to Georgia as a location, we will check the height of the employed individuals:\n\n- Employee a (height: 152 cm) - Below 171 cm\n- Employee b (height: 155 cm) - Below 171 cm\n- Employee d (height: 211 cm) - Above 171 cm\n\nAmong the employed individuals, only employee d is taller than 171 cm. Therefore, if we're looking at employed individuals regardless of location, there is only 1 person who is taller than 171 cm."
