        "To determine how many people who work in Illinois (IL) are taller than 150, we need to check two things for each individual: their height and whether they work in IL.\n\nBased on the provided input dataset, there is no direct information about anybody working in Illinois because the 'location' field shows NY (New York), TX (Texas), WA (Washington), and CA (California). Since IL (Illinois) is not listed, we cannot find any person from the dataset who works in Illinois.\n\nHowever, if you meant to ask how many people are taller than 150 and currently employed, regardless of their location, we can proceed with that question. From the dataset, we can see that there are two individuals marked as 'employed':\n\n1. Individual with primeKey 'b' - height 141 (not taller than 150)\n2. Individual with primeKey 'd' - height 213 (taller than 150)\n\nAmong the employed individuals, only one person (primeKey 'd') is taller than 150. Therefore, the answer would be 1 individual if we consider employment status rather than the location in IL."
