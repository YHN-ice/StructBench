        "To determine how many people who work in Georgia (GA) are taller than 180 cm, we need to match the employee information with their employment status and location, then find those who are employed, located in GA, and taller than 180 cm.\n\nHowever, there is a slight issue with the provided data: the location codes are not standard US state abbreviations in the input data. We have \"CA,\" \"HI,\" \"IL,\" and \"WA\" which correspond to California, Hawaii, Illinois, and Washington respectively. There are no individuals in the provided data that are located in Georgia (as there is no \"GA\" present in the location field).\n\nGiven this, we cannot find any individuals who work in Georgia (GA) as none are listed in the provided data. However, if we ignore the GA requirement and simply look for individuals who are employed and taller than 180 cm regardless of location, we can identify them as follows:\n\n- Person b (w) is retired, not employed; thus does not meet the criteria.\n- Person e (z) is employed and has a height of 185 cm.\n- Person h (cb) is employed and has a height of 213 cm.\n\nBased on the above assessment, there are two people who are employed and taller than 180 cm. The requirement for working in GA cannot be assessed as such information is not available in the input."
