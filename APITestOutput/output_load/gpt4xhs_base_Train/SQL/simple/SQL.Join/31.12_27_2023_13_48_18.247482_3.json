        "To determine how many people who work in IL (Illinois) are taller than 151 cm, we need to check the \"location\" column for individuals located in IL. Then, we can look at their corresponding heights to see if they exceed 151 cm.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n1. Individual c works at Apple in IL and has a height of 183 cm, which is taller than 151 cm.\n2. Individual g is unemployed but located in IL and has a height of 158 cm, which is also taller than 151 cm.\n3. Individual j is unemployed but located in IL and has a height of 163 cm, which is again taller than 151 cm.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 people located in IL who are taller than 151 cm. However, it's important to note that individual g and j are marked as unemployed; thus, if we only consider those who are employed, the answer would be 1 person (individual c) who works in IL and is taller than 151 cm."
