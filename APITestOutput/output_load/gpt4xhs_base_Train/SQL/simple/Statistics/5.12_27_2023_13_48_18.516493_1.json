Person with primeKey 'a' is employed with a salary of 790319.\n2. Person with primeKey 'b' is retired, so they do not count even though their salary is listed.\n3. Person with primeKey 'c' is unemployed, so they do not count.\n4. Person with primeKey 'd' is employed but has a salary of 14883, which is less than 574419.\n5.
