        "To find out how many people work with a salary more than 752363, you need to filter the table by the 'status' column for those who are employed and the 'salary' column for those who earn more than 752363.\n\nBased on the input provided, let's check each entry:\n\n- a: unemployed, so does not meet the employment criteria.\n- b: retired, so does not meet the employment criteria.\n- c: unemployed, so does not meet the employment criteria, but also has a salary over 752363.\n- d: retired, so does not meet the employment criteria.\n- e: retired, so does not meet the employment criteria.\n- f: employed, but the salary is 90620, which is less than 752363.\n- g: unemployed, so does not meet the employment criteria.\n- h: unemployed, so does not meet the employment criteria, but also has a salary over 752363.\n- i: unemployed, so does not meet the employment criteria.\n\nHowever, you may notice that although we are looking for those who are employed with a high salary, in this data set, the 'status' and 'salary' columns do not align in a realistic manner as unemployed individuals do not typically have a salary. Assuming we consider 'unemployed' as a status but still having a salary (which is odd in real-world terms), we have two individuals (c and h) who have salaries above 752363.\n\nTherefore, if we count only those who are employed (as per the usual definition), no one meets both criteria of being employed with a salary more than 752363. If we include 'unemployed' with salaries as part of our count, there would be two people earning more than 752363. The question is somewhat ambiguous because it doesn't specify if only people who are currently working/employed should be considered or if any listed salary should be counted regardless of employment status."
