It's not entirely clear from your question whether you want to access the `id` or the `Z`, so I'll provide both options:\n\nTo access the `id` field at the top level:\n```javascript\nobj['id']\n```\n\nTo access the `Z` field at the top level:\n```javascript\nobj['Z']\n```\n\nBoth of these will output `\"d\"` as per your request.
