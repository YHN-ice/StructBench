If you were to access a nested value like `q` under `\"X\"` instead, you would use a deeper path:\n\n```javascript\nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"] // In JavaScript for accessing 'q'\n```\n\n```python\nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"] # In Python for accessing 'q'\n```\n\nPlease adjust the format and notation based on the actual data structure and programming language you are using."
