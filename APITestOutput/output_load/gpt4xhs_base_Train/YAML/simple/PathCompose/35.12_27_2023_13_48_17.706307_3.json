Assuming that the intent is for 'Z' to be a key with the value 'f', and 'subs' is a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing an 'id', a key (like 'Y' or 'X'), and potentially more 'subs', the structure could be represented in Python like this:\n\n```python\nobj = {\n    \"id\": \"c\",\n    \"Z\": \"f\",\n    \"subs\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"d\",\n            \"Y\": \"e\",\n            \"subs\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": \"e\",\n                    \"X\": \"d\",\n                    \"subs\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nTo access the value \"f\" from this structure, you would use the keys and indexes to navigate through it:\n\n```python\nvalue_f = obj[\"Z\"]\n```\n\nIn this case, there is no need for multiple keys or indices because the value \"f\" is directly associated with the key \"Z\" at the top level of the given object. If the structure was more deeply nested and 'f' was inside one of the 'subs', you would then need to use multiple keys and indices to dig down to the correct level."
