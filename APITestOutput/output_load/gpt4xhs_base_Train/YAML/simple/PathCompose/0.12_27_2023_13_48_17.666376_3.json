Here's the breakdown:\n\n- `obj` is the top-level object.\n- `['subs']` accesses the `subs` key in the object, which holds an array.\n- `[0]` accesses the first element in the `subs` array.\n- `['Y']` accesses the `Y` key in the nested object, where the value \"j\" is stored.\n\nPlease note that I'm making an assumption about the structure based on your input. The actual path could differ if, for example, `subs` is not at the top level of your structure or if there is more than one element in any arrays.
