To access \"p\", you follow the keys and indices:\n\n- First, you access the `subs` list of the top-level object: `obj[\"subs\"]`.\n- Since `subs` is a list, you take the first element (index 0) of that list: `obj[\"subs\"][0]`.\n- You then access the `subs` list within the first element: `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"]`.\n- Again, since this `subs` is a list, you take the first element (index 0) of that list: `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0]`.\n- Finally, you access the key `\"X\"` to get the value `\"p\"`: `obj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"]`.\n\nIf you're specifically looking for the notation as mentioned in the question, it would be:\n\n```\nobj[\"subs\"][0][\"subs\"][0][\"X\"]\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this assumes that the provided input has been parsed into a suitable data structure like a Python dictionary with lists for the `subs`.
