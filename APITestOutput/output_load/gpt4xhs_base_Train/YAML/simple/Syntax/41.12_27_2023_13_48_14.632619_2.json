The `subs: []` line is correctly formatted, but the nesting of items within this list should maintain consistent indentation.\n\nA corrected version of the structure (assuming the intention of the original) might look something like this:\n\n```yaml\nid: \"d\"\nZ: u\nsubs: \n  - id: \"e\"\n    Y: t\n    subs: \n      - id: \"f\"\n        X: s\n        subs: []\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, unnecessary commas are removed, indentation is consistent, and there are no orphaned elements without keys."
