The lines with just `:p`, `:q`, `:r`, `:s`, `:t`, `:u`, `:v`, `:w`, `:x`, `:y`, `:z`, `:ab`, `:bb`, and `:cb` are incorrect. They seem to be intended as keys without values, but they are malformed. In YAML, a key without a value can be represented with a null value using `~` or `null`.\n\n3. The indentation seems incorrect. In YAML, proper indentation is crucial for denoting structure, and nested elements should be indented further than their parents. There are places where the indentation level decreases unexpectedly (e.g., after \"subs: []\" the next line starts with \":p\" at the same indentation level).\n\n4. Additionally, the intent of keys like \":p\" is unclear since they are not followed by a value and are not properly structured as key-value pairs.\n\nDepending on what you intended with the lines like \":p\", they either need to be removed or corrected to valid key-value pairs with appropriate indentation and without trailing commas."
