List items (denoted with `-`) should be indented within their parent list or map, but there are inconsistencies in the indentation (e.g., the list under `subs` should all be at the same indentation level but they are not).\n\n5. The very last line, `:eb`, like the other similar issues mentioned, appears to be attempting to provide a value without a key, which is not valid.\n\nGiven these issues, this YAML snippet is not correctly structured and would need corrections for it to be successfully parsed by a YAML parser."
