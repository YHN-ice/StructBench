Commas at the end of key-value pairs: YAML does not require commas to separate key-value pairs as JSON does. This can cause parsing errors in YAML.\n\n2. Colons followed by ids (e.g., `:i`, `:j`, `:k`, etc.): These are placed at the end of some mappings and don't correspond to any valid YAML syntax.
