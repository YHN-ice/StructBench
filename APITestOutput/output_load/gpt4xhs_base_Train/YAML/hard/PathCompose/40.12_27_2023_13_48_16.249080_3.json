        "To access the value \"oy\" in the given structure, you would navigate down the hierarchy from the top level, through the keys and indices that lead to the desired value. Here's how to do it step by step:\n\n1. Start at the top-level object, which I'll refer to as `obj`.\n2. Access the `subs` key to get to the array of sub-objects.\n3. Determine which element of the `subs` array contains the `id: \"o\"` object. In this case, it's the second element (index `1` if it's a 0-based index array).\n4. Within that object with `id: \"o\"`, access its `subs` key to get to its array of sub-objects.\n5. Determine which element of this `subs` array contains the `id: \"p\"` object. It's the first element (index `0`).\n6. Within the object with `id: \"p\"`, access the key `M` to get the value \"oy\".\n\nPutting it all together, the expression to access \"oy\" would be:\n\n```plaintext\nobj['subs'][1]['subs'][0]['M']\n```\n\nIf you are using JavaScript-like syntax, you can also use dot notation for named keys:\n\n```javascript\nobj.subs[1].subs[0].M\n```\n\nPlease note, the specific syntax might slightly vary depending on the programming language you are using, but the general concept of accessing nested objects and arrays would be similar."
