Each line represents an edge between a parent and a child node, with the arrow indicating the direction from parent to child.\n\nStarting at the root node 'k', we can identify all paths leading to leaf nodes and count the number of edges in each path. The maximum number of edges encountered in any such path will give us the height of the root node.\n\nBased on the given input, we can see that 'k' is the root node, and there are multiple paths from 'k' to various leaf nodes. We need to find the path with the maximum number of edges (the longest path).\n\nFrom a quick inspection, we can determine that all paths from 'k' branch off at various points but eventually lead to leaf nodes that are 3 edges away (since every node except 'k' has exactly one parent and every non-leaf node has at least one child, forming a 3-level hierarchy).\n\nThe longest path from root 'k' to any leaf node has 3 edges.
