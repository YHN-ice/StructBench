        "To determine the height of the root node in this tree, we need to find the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. Each line in the input describes an edge from a parent node to a child node. The height is the number of edges in the longest such path. \n\nBy examining the given input structure, we can see that the tree is symmetrical with respect to each child of the root node 't'. Each child of 't' has similar substructures with depth 3 (including edges from 't' to its direct children). Since all paths from 't' to the leaves have the same length, we can calculate the height by simply counting the edges from 't' to any leaf.\n\nHere's how to count the edges:\n- From 't' to its direct child (e.g., 'u', 'pb', 'kc', 'fd'): 1 edge\n- From that child to its own child (e.g., 'v', 'qb', 'lc', 'gd'): 1 edge\n- And from there to a leaf (e.g., 'w', 'rb', 'mc', 'hd'): 1 edge\n\nTotal edges: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the height of the root node 't' is 3."
