The longest sub-branch from 'x' appears to be 'x -> ib -> jb', which has a height of 2 edges.\n- Another branch is 'w -> sb'. The longest sub-branch from 'sb' seems to be 'sb -> tb -> ub', which has a height of 2 edges.\n- There's also the branch 'w -> nc'. The longest sub-branch from 'nc' is 'nc -> oc -> pc', with a height of 2 edges.\n- Finally, there's the branch 'w -> id'. The longest sub-branch from 'id' is 'id -> jd -> kd', also with a height of 2 edges.\n\nAs all these branches have the same height, we add 1 for the edge connecting 'w' to its immediate child nodes ('x', 'sb', 'nc', 'id'). Therefore, the height of the root node 'w' would be 2 (longest sub-branch) + 1 (edge to the immediate child) = 3 edges."
