        "To determine the height of the root node, which is 'n' in this case, we need to find the longest path from the root node to any of its leaf nodes. We can do this by counting the number of edges along the longest branch from the root 'n' to a leaf node.\n\nFrom the given input, we can create a tree structure and observe that the longest path is from the root 'n' to any of its deepest children. Every line in the input represents an edge in the tree.\n\nHere is a simplified version showing the depth levels:\n- Level 0 (root): n\n- Level 1: o, jb, ec, zc\n- Level 2: p, u, z, eb, kb, pb, ub, zb, fc, kc, pc, uc, ad, fd, kd, pd\n- Level 3: q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, ab, bb, cb, db, fb, gb, hb, ib, lb, mb, nb, ob, qb, rb, sb, tb, vb, wb, xb, yb, bc, cc, dc...\n- (Levels continue increasing)\n\nIf we look at the structure of the input data carefully and observe that each subsequent node level (starting from 'o' at level 1) has nodes with children extending one level deeper than the previous level's nodes. With this pattern in mind, we can determine the depth without needing to write down the entire tree structure explicitly. Since each new node level introduces one additional edge before reaching its leaf nodes at the end of the chain (which have no children and are therefore not listed), we can count these levels to find the height.\n\nThe height of the root node 'n' is 3 because the maximum number of edges on any path from 'n' to a leaf node is 3 edges long (level 0 to level 3)."
