Given the input, we can see that the root node is 't', and the tree structure expands through multiple levels.\n\nTo find the height, we can visually represent the tree and count the number of edges along the longest path. However, in this case, it's clear that each subtree of 't' has the same depth because they all follow a similar pattern: 't' -> (another node) -> (another node) -> (leaf nodes). Each subtree has three edges from the root to the second-level node (like 'u', 'pb', 'kc', 'fd'), and then one more edge to the leaf nodes.\n\nSince all subtrees of 't' have an equal number of levels, we can simply count the edges in one of them. Let's look at the first one:\n\n- t->u (1 edge)\n- u->v (1 edge)\n- v->(leaf nodes: w, x, y, z) (1 edge)\n\nSo there are 3 edges in the longest path from 't' to any of its leaf nodes.
