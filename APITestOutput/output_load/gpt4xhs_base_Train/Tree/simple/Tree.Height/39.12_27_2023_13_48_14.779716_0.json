        "To calculate the height of the root node, we need to find the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. A height of 0 is assigned to a leaf node (a node with no children).\n\nFrom the list of edges provided, we can construct a tree starting from the root node 'y' and follow each branch to determine the maximum depth. The root node 'y' has several child nodes ('z', 'ub', 'pc', 'kd'), and we need to follow down each branch to measure their lengths.\n\nInstead of constructing the tree step by step, we can determine the maximum depth by counting the number of '->' since each represents an edge. The path with the most '->' will give us the height of the root node. Let's count the maximum number for any path from 'y':\n\n- Starting with 'y->z', the deepest path from 'z' goes through 2 additional edges: 'z->ab->bb' or any other leaf node under 'ab', or 'z->fb->gb', or 'z->kb->lb', or 'z->pb->qb'. So, this gives us a total height of 3 for any path under 'z'.\n- Now let's consider the path starting with 'y->ub'. The deepest path from 'ub' goes through 2 additional edges: 'ub->vb->wb' or any other leaf node under 'vb', 'ub->ac->bc', 'ub->fc->gc', or 'ub->kc->lc'. So, this also gives us a total height of 3 for any path under 'ub'.\n- Next, considering the path starting with 'y->pc'. The deepest path from 'pc' goes through 2 additional edges: 'pc->qc->rc' or any other leaf node under 'qc', 'pc->vc->wc', 'pc->ad->bd', or 'pc->fd->gd'. So, this path also has a total height of 3.\n- Lastly, considering the path starting with 'y->kd'. The deepest path from 'kd' goes through 2 additional edges: 'kd->ld->md' or any other leaf node under 'ld', 'kd->qd->rd', 'kd->vd->wd', or 'kd->ae->be'. So, this gives us a total height of 3 for any path under 'kd'.\n\nSince all four branches from the"
