        "To determine the height of the root node, we need to identify the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. The input provides a description of the tree structure in terms of parent-child relationships.\n\nThe root node in this input is 'b'. We have to follow each branch from 'b' to the leaves and count the number of edges in each path. The height of the root node will be the maximum number of edges found in these paths.\n\nLet's examine the paths starting from 'b'. The children of 'b' are 'c', 'x', 'sb', and 'nc'. We now have to look at each branch and count the number of edges:\n\nFor example, for 'b' -> 'c' -> 'd' -> 'e', there are 3 edges in this path.\nWe must do this for all branches and find the maximum length.\n\nHowever, because I cannot see the whole tree structure at once, I'll have to count the longest path based on your input. The longest path appears to be:\n\n'b' -> 'sb' -> 'tb' -> 'ub' (4 edges)\n\nSo, if 'ub' is a leaf node (which means it doesn't have any children), then this would represent the longest path and thus the height of the root node would be 4.\n\nTherefore, the height of the root node is 4."
