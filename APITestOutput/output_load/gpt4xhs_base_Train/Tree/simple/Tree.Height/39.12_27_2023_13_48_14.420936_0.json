        "The input describes a tree with root node 'k'. Each line specifies a child-parent relationship (child->parent). From the description, we can determine the longest path from the root node to any leaf node by identifying the longest chain of nodes connected by edges.\n\nLet's identify the longest path:\n\n- The longest path starts from 'k', and 'k' has children: l, gb, bc, wc.\n- Checking each child:\n  - 'l' has children m, r, w, bb. Among these, 'm' and 'r' have further children.\n    - 'm' has children n, o, p, q, which are leaf nodes (height of m is 1).\n    - 'r' has children s, t, u, v; these are also leaf nodes (height of r is 1).\n    - 'w' has children x, y, z, ab; these are also leaf nodes (height of w is 1).\n    - 'bb' has children cb, db, eb, fb; these are also leaf nodes (height of bb is 1).\n  - 'gb' has children hb, mb, rb, wb. Each of these children has their own children.\n    - 'hb', 'mb', 'rb', and 'wb' have children that are all leaf nodes (height of hb, mb, rb, and wb is 1).\n  - 'bc' has children cc, hc, mc, rc. Each of these children has their own children.\n    - 'cc', 'hc', 'mc', and 'rc' have children that are all leaf nodes (height of cc, hc, mc, and rc is 1).\n  - 'wc' has children xc, cd, hd, md. Each of these children has their own children.\n    - 'xc', 'cd', 'hd', and 'md' have children that are all leaf nodes (height of xc, cd, hd, and md is 1).\n\nSo far we see that all second-level nodes only extend to a height of 1 with their own children. Since each level adds a height of 1 and leaf nodes are height 0:\n\n- Root node 'k': height 0\n- Children of 'k': height 1\n- Grandchildren (leaf nodes) of 'k': height 2\n\nThe height of the root node would therefore be the sum of the heights on"
