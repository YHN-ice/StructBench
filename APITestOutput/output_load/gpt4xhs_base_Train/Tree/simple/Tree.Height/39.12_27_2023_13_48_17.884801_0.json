The root node is 'z', and from each non-leaf node, there is a list of its children.\n\nHere's how we can analyze the tree:\n\n1. Start at the root node 'z'.\n2. For each child of the root node, determine the height of the subtree rooted at that child by recursively determining the height of its children plus one for the edge connecting it to the root.\n3.

The subtree rooted at 'vb' also has a height of 2 (e.g., 'vb' -> 'wb' -> 'xb').\n- The subtree rooted at 'qc' also seems to have the same pattern and would have a height of 2.\n- Similarly, 'ld' has children which, after inspection, show that its subtree also has a height of 2.\n\nSince all children of 'z' have a subtree height of 2 and there are no deeper subtrees, we add 1 for the edge between the root and its children. Therefore, the height of the root node is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe height of the root node is an integer value: **3**."
