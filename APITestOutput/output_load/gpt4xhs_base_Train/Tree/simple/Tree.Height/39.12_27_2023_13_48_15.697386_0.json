        "To find the height of the root node (which is 'h' in this case), we need to identify the longest path from the root node to any of its leaf nodes.\n\nGiven the tree structure provided in the input, we'll start at the root node 'h' and follow each path until we reach a leaf node. We'll then count the number of edges in each path and find the maximum count among them.\n\nLet's analyze the structure and find the longest path:\n\n- Starting from 'h', there are multiple paths going through its children ('i', 'db', 'yb', 'tc'). We'll explore each to find the maximum depth.\n- For 'i' and its subtree, we see that 'i' leads to four other nodes ('j', 'o', 't', 'y'), each with their own subtrees. The longest path in this subtree goes through 'i -> t -> x', which has a total of 3 edges.\n- For 'db' and its subtree, we see that 'db' leads to four other nodes ('eb', 'jb', 'ob', 'tb'). The longest path within this subtree goes through 'db -> eb -> ib', which has a total of 3 edges.\n- For 'yb' and its subtree, we see that 'yb' leads to four other nodes ('zb', 'ec', 'jc', 'oc'). The longest path within this subtree goes through 'yb -> zb -> dc', which has a total of 3 edges.\n- For 'tc' and its subtree, we see that 'tc' leads to four other nodes ('uc', 'zc', 'ed', 'jd'). The longest path within this subtree goes through 'tc -> uc -> yc', which has a total of 3 edges.\n\nLooking at all the paths, we see that the longest path from the root node 'h' to any leaf node consists of 3 edges.\n\nTherefore, the height of the root node is 3."
