To find the height of the root node, we need to determine the longest path from the root to any leaf node.\n\nLet's start from the root node 'j' and count the number of edges along the longest path:\n\n- Starting from j (root), we see it has children nodes k, fb, ac, and vc.\n- It appears that all children of j branch out similarly, creating paths of equal length.
