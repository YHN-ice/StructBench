        "The input describes a tree structure using a parent->child notation where 't' signifies the root node. To calculate the height of the root node, we can follow the edges from 't' down to the leaf nodes, counting the edges along the longest path.\n\nFrom the input, we can see that each step from the root node 't' goes down to another level. Since 't' is the root, we'll start with an initial height of 0 and increment as we go down each level. \n\nThe longest path from the root node 't' is when we move down three levels (since at each intermediate node we have subsequent children and 't' is connected to multiple second-level nodes like 'u', 'pb', 'kc', and 'fd'). The input appears to be symmetrical, with each second-level node having a similar structure of children and sub-children.\n\nGiven that each second-level node ('u', 'pb', 'kc', 'fd') has children and grandchildren, and since they all seem to have the same depth, we can just count the depth from one branch to determine the height of the tree. Let's use the first branch as an example:\n\n1. t->u (first edge)\n2. u->v (second edge)\n3. v->w (third edge)\n\nSince 'w' is a leaf node, we stop here. The longest path contains 3 edges, so the height of the root node 't' is 3."
