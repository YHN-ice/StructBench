Since the input describes a tree with 'd' being the root node, we can follow each path from 'd' to the leaf nodes and count the number of edges.\n\nFrom the input, we can see that every child node has exactly 4 or 5 leaf nodes connected to it. This means that no matter which path we take from 'd', we will always encounter two edges before reaching a leaf.\n\nHence, the height of the root node 'd' (the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node) is 2."
