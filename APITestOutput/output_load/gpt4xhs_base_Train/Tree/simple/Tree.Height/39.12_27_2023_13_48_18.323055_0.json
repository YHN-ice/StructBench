        "To determine the height of the root node (the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to any leaf node), we need to analyze the given tree structure and find the longest path from the root node 'k' to any of its leaf nodes.\n\nTo do this, we can follow each branch from the root node to its furthest leaf node and count the number of edges along that path. The branch with the most edges will give us the height of the root node.\n\nLet's analyze the given input and find the longest path:\n\nStarting from the root 'k', we can see that 'k' branches out into 'l', 'gb', 'bc', and 'wc'. Each of these sub-branches will be analyzed for their height:\n\n- For branch 'l', we can see that it has a further branch 'r', which has a height of 2 (since 'r' branches out to 's', 't', 'u', 'v' which are leaves), and branch 'w' also has a height of 2 (since 'w' branches out into leaves 'x', 'y', 'z', 'ab'). Additionally, branch 'bb' has a height of 2 (since 'bb' branches out into leaves 'cb', 'db', 'eb', 'fb'). This makes the total height for branch 'l': 1 (edge k-l) + 2 = 3.\n\n- For branch 'gb', we can see that it has further branches like 'hb', which has a height of 2 ('hb' branches out into leaves 'ib', 'jb', 'kb', 'lb'), so does 'mb' ('mb' branches out into leaves 'nb', 'ob', 'pb', 'qb'), and similarly for 'rb' and 'wb'. Therefore, the total height for branch 'gb': 1 (edge k-gb) + 2 = 3.\n\n- For branch 'bc', similar analysis shows that it also has a height of 3 (for example, 'hc' branches to leaves 'ic', 'jc', 'kc', and 'lc').\n\n- For branch 'wc', it also has sub-branches like 'xc' with a height of 2, so it follows that it also has a total height of 3.\n\nSince all four primary branches from the root node have a height of 3, the height of the root node is 3."
