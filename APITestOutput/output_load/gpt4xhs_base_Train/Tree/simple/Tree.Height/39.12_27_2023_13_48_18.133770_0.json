        "The input describes a tree structure with edges between nodes. Each line represents a parent-child relationship in the format `parent->child`. To find the height of the root node (which is 'e' in this case), we need to identify the longest path from the root node to any of its leaf nodes.\n\nBy visually inspecting the input, it is evident that there are several paths from the root node 'e' to various leaf nodes. We need to count the number of edges in the longest of these paths. The height of the tree will be the length of this longest path.\n\nLet's consider each direct child of 'e' (namely 'f', 'ab', 'vb', 'qc', and 'gd') and look at their longest paths:\n\n1. 'f' has a longest path of 2 edges (to any of 'g', 'l', 'q', or 'v' and then to their children, i.e., 'f->g->h' or equivalent).\n2. 'ab' has a longest path of 2 edges (similar reasoning as for 'f').\n3. 'vb' has a longest path of 2 edges (similar reasoning as for 'f').\n4. 'qc' has a longest path of 2 edges (similar reasoning as for 'f').\n5. 'gd' has a longest path of 1 edge (to any of its children, i.e., 'gd->hd' or equivalent).\n\nThe longest path from the root 'e' goes through one of its children (like 'f', 'ab', 'vb', or 'qc'), then one of their children, and finally to one of the leaf nodes. This gives us a height of:\n\n1 (edge from 'e' to its child) + 1 (edge from the child to its child) = 2\n\nTherefore, the height of the root node is 2."
