        "To find the height of the root node, we need to find the longest path from the root node to any of its leaf nodes. In this case, each line represents an edge between a parent node and a child node, with the parent node appearing before the \"->\" and the child node after it.\n\nLooking through the edges provided, we see that they all follow a consistent pattern where each node has one or more children. The height of the root node will be the number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf. We will count the levels of descendants from the root node \"p\".\n\nThe edges are organized in such a way that it can be seen that each node has a similar depth level of descendants in this tree structure. Given this information, we can simply count the longest chain from the root node \"p\" down to a leaf node by following any branch as they all seem to have similar lengths.\n\nFor example, let's follow the first path from \"p\":\n- p (root, height 0)\n  - q (height 1)\n    - r (height 2)\n      - s (height 3, leaf)\n\nAnd let's take a look at another path:\n- p (root, height 0)\n  - lb (height 1)\n    - mb (height 2)\n      - nb (height 3, leaf)\n\nEach time we move from a parent to a child, we increase the height by 1. We can see from both of these paths that we reach a leaf node at height 3.\n\nSince all nodes seem to follow similar branching patterns, we can confidently say that the height of the root node \"p\" is **3**."
