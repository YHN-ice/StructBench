We need to find the path from 'g' to its furthest leaf that has the most edges. The longest path from 'g' is one that goes through as many intermediates as possible before reaching a leaf.\n\nBy analyzing the input structure, we can see that 'g' connects to multiple nodes: h, cb, xb, and sc.

Since there are no deeper paths mentioned in the input, we can conclude that the height of the root node 'g' is 3."
