        "To find the height of the root node in this tree structure, we need to identify the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. Based on the input provided, which describes the edges in a tree, we can analyze the structure to find the longest path.\n\nLet's start from the root node 'w' and trace paths down to all leaf nodes. The longest of these paths will give us the height of the root node. We're looking for the number of edges in this longest path.\n\nFrom 'w', there are several branches, but without drawing the entire tree, we can see that each branch goes down a few levels. To determine the height, we can simply count the levels (edges) for each of these branches and find the one with the most levels.\n\nLet's take one of the longer-looking paths for example:\n- w->x->y->z\n\nThis path has a length of 3 edges, as there are 3 transitions between nodes. We need to check all branches emanating from 'w' to ensure we find the longest one.\n\nHowever, we see other branches from 'w' that lead to nodes with a similar depth:\n- w->x->db->eb (or fb/gb/hb)\n- w->x->ib->jb (or kb/lb/mb)\n- w->x->nb->ob (or pb/qb/rb)\n- w->sb->tb->ub (or vb/wb/xb)\n- w->sb->yb->zb (or ac/bc/cc)\n- w->sb->dc->ec (or fc/gc/hc)\n- w->sb->ic->jc (or kc/lc/mc)\n- w->nc->oc->pc (or qc/rc/sc)\n- w->nc->tc->uc (or vc/wc/xc)\n- w->nc->yc->zc (or ad/bd/cd)\n- w->nc->dd->ed (or fd/gd/hd)\n- w->id->jd->kd (or ld/md/nd)\n- w->id->od->pd (or qd/rd/sd)\n- w->id->td->ud (or vd/wd/xd)\n- w->id->yd->zd (or ae/be/ce)\n\nBased on these paths, it seems that there are no paths longer than 3 edges from the root 'w' to any leaf node."
