Since the input depicts a tree structure in an edge list format, where each line represents an edge from a parent node to a child node (e.g., `y->z` means there is an edge from `y` to `z`), we need to build this tree and then perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find the maximum depth.\n\nHowever, manually calculating the height of such a large tree would be impractical and error-prone.
