The height of the root node will then be the number of edges in that path.\n\nLooking at the input, we're given a series of edges in a tree starting with the root node \"z.\" The longest path can be found by identifying the longest sequence of child nodes from \"z\" down to a leaf node (a node with no children).\n\nConsidering that there are many edges, and this is a manual process, it's impractical to list all paths to find the longest one.
