Similarly, tags like `<G>`, `<J>`, `<M>`, `<P>`, `<Q>`, and others also don't have the corresponding closing tags.\n\n3. The structure of the XML is quite deeply nested without proper closure which makes it difficult to ascertain the exact intended hierarchy, but the lack of closure is clear.\n\nTo fix these issues, each opening tag needs a corresponding closing tag before any ancestor element is closed or another sibling is opened.
