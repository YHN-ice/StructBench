For example, `<F U=\"f\">` is opened, but there is no corresponding `</F>` closing tag before opening `<G T=\"e\">`.\n2. Incorrect nesting of elements: Elements are not properly nested within their parent elements. For example, after the `<E>` tag is opened, the `<F>` tag is opened, and then the `<G>` tag is opened without closing `<F>`. This pattern continues with several other elements.\n3. Overlapping elements: Elements like `<E>`, `<M>`, `<Q>`, `<V>`, `<W>`, `<Z>`, `<FB>`, `<LB>`, `<MB>`, `<OB>`, `<SB>`, `<VB>`, and many others are started within other elements but not closed in the correct order, leading to overlapping which is not allowed in XML.\n\nThese are only a few examples of the structural errors in the provided XML. The correct structure would require each element to be properly nested and closed within its parent element before a sibling element is closed."
