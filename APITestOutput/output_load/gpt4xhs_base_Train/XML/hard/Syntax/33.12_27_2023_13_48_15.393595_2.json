There are multiple instances where opening and closing tags don't match or closing tags are missing entirely. For example:\n   - `<C>` tag is not properly closed.\n   - `<I>` tag is not properly closed in `<H>`.\n   - `<M>` tag is not properly closed in `<L>`.\n   - `<P>` tag is not properly closed in `<O>`.\n   - `<Q>` tag is not properly closed in `<P>`.\n   - and so on for several other tags throughout the document.\n\n2. Text nodes are not properly enclosed within tags or are placed outside closing tags. For example:\n   - The text \"groot essence\" appears between the `<G>` opening tag and `<H>` opening tag without a proper closing `</G>` tag.\n   - The text \"dentist\" appears outside of any tag structure after the text \"halo\".\n   - Similar issues continue with \"kangaroo cafe\", \"apple banana\", \"zen ravish banana\", etc.\n\n3. `<O>` opening tag appears twice, which may not be an error if the document intends to have elements with the same name, but considering the structure, this seems like an unintended issue as the second occurrence doesn't have a closing tag and leads to confusion.\n\nTo fix these errors, every element should be properly enclosed with matching opening and closing tags, and all text nodes should be correctly nested within corresponding element tags."
