The opening and closing tags are not properly nested in several cases, which violates the well-formedness rules of XML.\n\n3. The tag `<O>` has an attribute `O=\"a\"` which is not recommended because it can cause confusion with the element name. It's not strictly an error but is considered bad practice.\n\n4. Tag names such as `<AB>` and `<DB>` have attributes like `ZY` and `YY` that do not follow the traditional naming conventions of XML attributes. While not strictly errors, these also go against common practices and can lead to confusion.\n\n5. The presence of text content such as \"kangaroo\", \"cafe\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"ravish\", \"oops\", \"idiot\", \"monkey\", etc. is not enclosed properly within their respective elements, leading to additional structural issues.\n\nTo fix these errors, every tag must have a corresponding closing tag, nested elements must be closed in the reverse order of their opening, and text content must be properly enclosed within elements."
