Closing tags are missing for many of the elements, which is a fundamental requirement in XML for proper nesting of elements. For example, `<G>`, `<I>`, `<J>`, `<M>`, `<N>`, `<P>`, `<Q>`, `<V>`, `<Y>`, `<BB>`, `<CB>`, `<EB>`, `<FB>`, `<KB>`, `<MB>`, `<OB>`, `<QB>`, `<RB>`, `<SB>`, `<UB>`, `<VB>`, `<ZB>`, `<AC>`, `<CC>`, `<DC>`, `<GC>`, and `<FC>` are all missing their corresponding closing tags.\n\n2. Invalid nesting: Elements must be properly nested within each other. For example, the content \"essence\" is placed between `<G>` and `<H>` without being enclosed within an element.\n\n3. The attribute name \"O\" is reused as a tag name, which can be confusing and could potentially lead to issues with certain XML parsers. This occurs with the element: `<O O=\"wy\">`.\n\n4. The text nodes are often placed in between elements without proper containment. For example, \"groot banana\" and \"apple\" at the end of the document are not wrapped within any element.\n\nTo make this XML well-formed, each element needs to have a corresponding closing tag, elements need to be properly nested, and text nodes should be contained within elements. The structure should resemble something like this (simplified example):\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<A>\n  <B Z=\"h\" Y=\"g\">\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <F S=\"a\">far</F>\n    <G>groot</G>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <H R=\"zy\">\n      <I>idiot</I>\n      <J>jargon</J>\n      <!-- ... -->\n    </H>\n    <!-- ... -->\n  </B>\n  <!-- ... further structure with properly closed tags ... -->\n</A>\n```\n\nEach tag that is opened must be closed in the correct order to maintain proper nesting and hierarchy within the XML document."
