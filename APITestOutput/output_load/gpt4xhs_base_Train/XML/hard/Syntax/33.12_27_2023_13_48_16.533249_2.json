XML elements must have a closing tag or be self-closed if they are empty. Example: `<B>`, `<C>`, `<D>`, `<E>` and many others are not closed properly.\n2. Some elements start with a closing tag instead of an opening tag. Example: `<N L=\"f\">` should be `</N>` when closing.\n3. The nesting of elements is incorrect. Child elements need to be fully contained within their parent elements, but here we see tags like `<K>` and `<R>` starting without corresponding closing tags for the inner elements.\n4. The elements `<GB XY=\"ry\">`, `<AB B=\"vy\" A=\"uy\">`, `<BB>`, and others are introduced without closing their parent elements properly.\n\nAn XML document should be structured with properly nested and closed tags to ensure that it is well-formed. The sample provided does not adhere to these rules and therefore contains structural errors."
