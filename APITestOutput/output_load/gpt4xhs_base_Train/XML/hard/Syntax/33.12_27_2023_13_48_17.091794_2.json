For example, the `<H>`, `<M>`, `<N>`, `<P>`, `<J>`, `<BB>`, `<EB>`, `<MB>`, `<RB>`, `<UB>`, `<TB>`, `<CC>`, and others are opened but not properly closed with corresponding end tags.\n\n2. Some elements have text nodes (like \"groot essence\", \"halo\", \"cafe banana\", etc.) that are not contained within any child tags, which might cause issues depending on how the XML is supposed to be parsed or used.\n\n3. The structure is inconsistent with respect to the indentation and alignment of the tags, which, while not necessarily a syntax error, does make the XML difficult to read and understand.\n\nTo correct these issues, each element should be properly closed with an end tag, and text nodes should be properly wrapped in an element or handled according to the intended XML schema. Additionally, proper indentation should be applied for readability."
