Not all opening tags have corresponding closing tags (mismatched or missing closing tags). For example:\n   - The `<F>` tag does not have a closing tag before the `<G>` tag starts.\n   - The `<I>` tag does not have a closing tag before the `<J>` tag starts.\n   - The `<N>` tag does not have a closing tag before the `</L>` tag.\n   - There are several other instances throughout the XML where tags are not properly closed.\n\n2. Some tags are closed out of order. The hierarchical structure of XML requires that tags be closed in the reverse order they were opened.\n\n3. There is an inconsistency in tag naming. For example, there is an opening `<N>` tag which would typically be closed with `</N>`, but later on, there is an attempt to open another `<N>` tag before closing the first one.\n\n4. Text content is interspersed improperly between tags without proper containment, such as \"halo\" and \"dentist\" between `<J>` and `<K>`, and several other similar cases.\n\nTo make this XML well-formed, every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag, and tags must nest properly within each other without overlapping.
