For example, the `<E>`, `<F>`, `<H>`, `<I>`, `<J>`, `<K>`, `<N>`, `<O>`, and more tags are opened but not closed.\n\n2. Closing tags should match opening tags, including their attribute names if any. However, we see that some tags are closed with incorrect names, such as `<Z>` is closed with `</ZB>` which has an additional attribute `ZY=\"qy\"`.\n\n3. Some elements are nested incorrectly, making it unclear how they should be properly closed. For instance, the content starting with 'groot' appears to be incorrectly nested within the `<G>` element and subsequent elements are affected as well.\n\n4. Tags such as `<AB>`, `<BB>`, `<AC>`, `<BC>`, `<CC>`, `<XC>`, `<YC>`, `<ZC>`, `<AD>`, `<BD>`, `<CD>`, `<DD>`, `<ED>`, `<FD>`, and `<GD>` are opened but not closed, causing the structure to be incomplete.\n\n5.
