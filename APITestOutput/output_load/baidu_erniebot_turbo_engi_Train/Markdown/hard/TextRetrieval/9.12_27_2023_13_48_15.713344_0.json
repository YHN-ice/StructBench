We need to account for both.\n2. **Nested elements**: Bold text can include other Markdown elements like italics, links, or inline code. We need to decide whether to include or exclude these nested elements.\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes the bold markers (asterisks or underscores) might be escaped with a backslash to display them literally, which means they should not be treated as formatting.\n4. **Incomplete formatting**: A Markdown file might have incomplete bold syntax (e.g., an opening `**` without a closing `**`). We need to determine how to handle such cases.\n5. **Multiple lines**: Bold text can span multiple lines. The parser needs to detect and handle multiline bold formatting.\n6. **Inline bold within a paragraph**: Bold text may appear inline within a paragraph or other elements, so the parser must be able to identify these inline styles correctly.\n7. **False positives**: There can be false positives, such as a sequence of asterisks or underscores that are not meant to be Markdown formatting.\n\nThese challenges need to be addressed by the parser to accurately extract all bold texts and ensure that the final output is correct."
