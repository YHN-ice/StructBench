The parser must handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italics, strikethroughs, or even hyperlinks. The parser should still be able to extract the bold text without including any other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are part of the text and not meant as formatting might be escaped with backslashes (e.g., `\\_not bold\\_`). The parser should recognize these and not treat them as bold markers.\n\n4. **False Positives from Code Blocks**: Text inside code blocks or inline code spans using backticks should not be treated as formatted text. Therefore, bold markers inside code blocks should be ignored.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting Markers**: There may be instances where the formatting markers are not correctly paired, leading to ambiguity in what is considered bold.\n\n6. **Link Text vs. Link Titles**: In Markdown, the link title might be in bold while the link text is not, or vice versa. The parser should correctly differentiate and extract only the relevant bold text.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text can span multiple lines. The parser needs to handle multiline formatting without breaking the text extraction.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is particularly large, performance considerations might come into play, and the parser needs to be efficient in processing the text.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that would need to be addressed in order to accurately extract all bold texts from a Markdown file."
