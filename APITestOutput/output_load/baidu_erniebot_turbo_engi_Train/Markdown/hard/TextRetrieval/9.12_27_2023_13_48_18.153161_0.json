In Markdown, bold text is typically indicated by double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` before and after the text. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Formatting**: There might be inconsistencies in how the bold text is formatted. For example, some bold texts might be formatted with asterisks while others with underscores.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting nested within it, such as italic, strikethrough, or inline code, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores meant to represent bold text might be escaped with a backslash, indicating that they should not be treated as formatting characters.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There could be instances where double asterisks or underscores don't actually indicate bold text but are part of a different element such as a link, image, or code block.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might be broken up by line breaks, which would need to be handled correctly to ensure complete extraction.\n\n6. **Incomplete Markers**: There could be instances where the closing asterisks or underscores are missing or where there's an odd number of asterisk or underscore characters, leading to ambiguity in what is considered bold.\n\n7. **Adjacent Bold Sections**: If there are multiple bold sections adjacent to each other, they might be mistaken for a single bold section if not parsed correctly.\n\n8. **Other Markdown Elements**: The presence of other Markdown elements such as headers, lists, blockquotes, etc., may interfere with the accurate identification of bold text.\n\nTo overcome these potential challenges, I will need to use a methodical approach that considers the syntax rules of Markdown and accurately identifies the patterns that represent bold text. Furthermore, I may need to implement additional checks and balances to handle edge cases and avoid incorrect extractions."
