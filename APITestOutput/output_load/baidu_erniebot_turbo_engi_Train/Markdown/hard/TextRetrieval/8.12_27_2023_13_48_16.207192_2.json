Both should be handled correctly to extract the filenames.\n\n3. **File extensions:** Images can have various file extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.). The parser needs to account for all possible image file types.\n\n4. **Inline HTML:** Markdown files may also include images using HTML tags such as `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"Description\" />`. A comprehensive parser would need to handle these cases as well.\n\n5. **Reference-style images:** Markdown allows for reference-style image links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but instead referenced elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. **Escaped characters:** Image syntax may include escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown elements:** Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which could complicate parsing.\n\n8. **Non-image links:** The parser must distinguish between image links and non-image links to avoid false positives.\n\n9. **Embedded base64 images:** Some Markdown documents may embed images using base64 data URIs instead of linking to a file.\n\n10. **Comments and non-standard syntax:** Comments or non-standard/custom Markdown extensions might obscure or change the way images are included in the document.\n\nOnce we see the actual input file, we can apply these considerations to extract all included image file names correctly."
