Commonly, double asterisks `**bold**` or double underscores `__bold__` are used. We need to search for both patterns.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like links `[**bold link**](url)` or italics `*italic **bold** text*`. The parser needs to extract the bold text without carrying over the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being parsed as Markdown, like `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should not treat these as bold text.\n\n4. **False positives**: Asterisks and underscores can also be used in contexts that are not meant to represent bold text, like in bullet points or horizontal rules. The parser should discern these uses from the actual bold text.\n\n5. **Incomplete syntax**: There may be instances where the syntax for bold is not properly closed, such as `**bold`. It will be necessary to decide whether to consider these as bold text or not.\n\n6. **Multiline bold**: Bold text might span multiple lines in the Markdown file, which can complicate the extraction process since some parsers might be line-based.\n\n7. **Code blocks or inline code**: Text within code blocks (indented with four spaces or fenced with three backticks) or inline code (surrounded by backticks) should not be treated as formatted text, even if they contain characters that resemble bold syntax.\n\n8. **Performance concerns**: If the Markdown file is very large, we need to ensure the parser is efficient and doesn't consume excessive resources.\n\n9. **Character encoding**: Non-standard characters or different character encodings could affect how the parser reads and interprets the file.\n\n10. **Links with bold text**: Sometimes, bold text is part of a hyperlink label, and care should be taken to extract only the text, not the markdown link structure.\n\nThese are just a few potential issues that might come up when parsing Markdown to extract bold text.
