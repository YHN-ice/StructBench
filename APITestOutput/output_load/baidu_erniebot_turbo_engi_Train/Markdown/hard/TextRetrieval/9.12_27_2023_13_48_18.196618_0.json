Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Different Markdown flavors**: There are multiple flavors of Markdown (like GitHub Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and each might have slightly different syntax for bold text. The parser needs to know which flavor is being used to accurately extract bold text.\n\n2. **Variation in syntax**: Bold text in Markdown can be created using a double asterisk `**` or double underscore `__` before and after the text. The parser should recognize both formats.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links or italic text. The parser needs to handle nested structures without being confused by the additional markup.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Bold syntax might include escaped characters that should not be treated as formatting markers.\n\n5. **False positives**: There may be instances where double asterisks or underscores are used in a context that does not indicate bold text (e.g., in a code block or used for other purposes such as indicating an action in a chat log).\n\n6. **Incomplete formatting**: There might be cases where the syntax for bold is not properly closed, leading to ambiguity about whether the text is meant to be bold or not.\n\n7. **Inline code blocks**: If bold markers are within inline code blocks (denoted by backticks `), they should not be treated as bold since they are part of code formatting.\n\nOnce the raw Markdown text is provided, these challenges will need to be addressed in order to extract all the bold texts accurately."
