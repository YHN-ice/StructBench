We'll have to handle each of these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text might be nested within other text elements like italics (`*` or `_`), links, or code blocks. We have to ensure we're only extracting bold text and not any nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are meant to be displayed as literal characters (escaped with a backslash, like `\\*` or `\\_`) shouldn't be confused with formatting syntax.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Sequences of asterisks or underscores not meant for text styling (e.g., used in lists or horizontal rules) should not be mistaken for bold syntax.\n\n5. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Some Markdown parsers support bold syntax spread over multiple lines. We'll need to decide if that's within the scope of this task.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) and inline code (surrounded by single backticks `) should not be parsed for Markdown formatting.\n\n7. **Link Labels**: The text within the square brackets of link labels might contain bold syntax, but it's part of the link, not separate bold text.\n\n8. **Incomplete Syntax**: Unmatched or incomplete bold syntax (e.g., one asterisk instead of two) can create ambiguity in identifying bold text.\n\n9. **Compatibility with Extended Markdown Flavors**: Some Markdown flavors like GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) may introduce additional complexity or differences in how bold is parsed.\n\n10. **Other Formatting Conflicts**: Bold syntax might be immediately followed or preceded by other formatting elements like lists, headers, blockquotes, etc., which could complicate parsing.\n\nTo address these challenges, we would need a robust parsing strategy that can correctly identify and extract bold text according to the rules of the Markdown flavor we're dealing with."
