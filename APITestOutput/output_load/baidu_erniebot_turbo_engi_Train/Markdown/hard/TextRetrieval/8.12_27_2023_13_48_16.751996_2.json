The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but there are slight variations that could also be used.\n   \n2. **Reference-style images**: Images can also be included using reference-style links, which can be harder to parse because the URL for the image is not inline with the alt text, but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files include images using raw HTML tags, such as `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"description\" />`. These can be more complex to detect and require different parsing logic.\n\n4. **Relative and absolute paths**: Images can be linked with both relative and absolute paths. Absolute paths may include URLs, while relative paths would refer to the file system structure.\n\n5. **Text that looks like images**: Sometimes, text might be formatted in a way that looks similar to the Markdown image syntax but isn't an image, for example, `! [Alt text](URL \"Title\")` (with a space after the `!`), which could be a false positive.\n\n6. **Escape characters**: Occasionally, image syntax might contain escape characters that need to be taken into account during parsing.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown elements**: There might be nested Markdown elements within the alt text or title of an image which need to be correctly identified and not confused with separate elements.\n\n8. **Multiline definitions**: Some Markdown parsers support multiline definitions for links and images. This would require the parser to handle line breaks appropriately when extracting image data.\n\n9. **File extensions**: Assuming only certain file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) are valid for images, it's important to recognize all possible valid image file extensions.\n\nTo correctly extract all the included image files, the parser will need to handle these potential difficulties and parse the input Markdown content accordingly."
