We need to check for both to ensure we capture all bolded content.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text can contain other formatting like italics, inline code, or links. We'll need to ensure that we strip away the other formatting but leave the bold text intact.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped in the markdown to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting. We need to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting**: There could be instances where the formatting is not completed properly (e.g., missing a closing asterisk or underscore), which would make it harder to identify the intended bold text.\n\n5. **Cross-paragraph bolding**: In rare cases, the bold formatting might start in one paragraph and end in another. Handling this scenario correctly would require multi-line parsing.\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks and inline code is usually not formatted, but if bold syntax appears inside them, it should not be interpreted as bold text.\n\nBy anticipating these issues, we can be better prepared to handle various situations during the parsing process."
