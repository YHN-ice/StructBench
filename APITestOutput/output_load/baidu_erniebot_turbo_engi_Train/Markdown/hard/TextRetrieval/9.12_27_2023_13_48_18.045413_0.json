Commonly, asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`) before and after the text are used, but we need to ensure which one is used in the given file.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might be nested within other elements, like links (`[text](url)`) or italics. Proper parsing would need to account for such nesting and extract only the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes the syntax characters are escaped to show asterisks or underscores as literals (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). These should not be confused with actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Syntax**: If the Markdown syntax is not properly closed (e.g., missing an asterisk), this may result in incorrect extraction of bold text.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might go across multiple lines, and the parser would need to handle line breaks correctly.\n\n6. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores might be used in contexts other than for bold text (e.g., in bullet lists, for thematic breaks, etc.), which might lead to false positives if not properly accounted for.\n\nAddressing these issues would require being mindful of the Markdown syntax and possibly applying a robust parsing strategy that can correctly identify the bold text according to the used Markdown flavor's rules."
