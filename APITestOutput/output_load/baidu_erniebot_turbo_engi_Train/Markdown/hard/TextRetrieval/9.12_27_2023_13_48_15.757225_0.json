Commonly, `**bold text**` and `__bold text__` are used to denote bold. We need to ensure that the parser can recognize all syntax variations that denote bold text.\n\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text might contain other formatting inside it, such as italics, code, or even links. The parser must be able to distinguish between the bold markers and other formatting markers and still extract the text correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Sometimes the bold markers might be escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they are not intended to make the text bold. The parser should recognize escaped characters and not treat them as formatting.\n\n4. **Inline bold text:** Bold text could appear inline with other text. The parser needs to be able to extract just the bold parts without capturing adjacent non-bold text.\n\n5. **Multi-line bold text:** Sometimes, bold text might span multiple lines, especially in more complex Markdown files. The parser should handle multi-line bold formatting correctly.\n\n6. **False positives from other elements:** Other elements like headings, which also use the `#` sign or list items with `*`, might be confused with bold syntax if not correctly parsed.\n\n7. **Inconsistent use of spaces:** Some users might inconsistently use spaces around the bold markers (e.g., `** bold **`, `**bold **`, etc.), which could confuse a more naive parsing algorithm.\n\nDepending on how the input file is structured and which Markdown flavor is used, these challenges might complicate the extraction process."
