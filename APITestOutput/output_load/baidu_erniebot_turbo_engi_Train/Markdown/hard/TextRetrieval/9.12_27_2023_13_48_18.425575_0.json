I need to check for both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, strikethrough, or inline code blocks. I must ensure only the bold text is extracted, not the formatting from other elements.\n\n3. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed with corresponding asterisks or underscores, which could lead to incorrect extraction.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash, indicating they should not be treated as formatting markers. I need to ignore escaped characters when parsing.\n\n5. **Links or Images**: The bold syntax might be part of a link or image description, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Literal Code Blocks**: Text within fenced code blocks or indented code blocks should not be considered for formatting, as they represent literal text.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and handling line breaks properly is necessary to ensure complete extraction.\n\n8. **Other Markdown Elements**: Headings, lists, and blockquotes might contain bold text. The parser needs to recognize bold text within these structures as well.\n\nWith these challenges in mind, please provide the input file so I can proceed with extracting the bold texts."
