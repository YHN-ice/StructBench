These nested elements should be handled properly to extract just the bold text.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores may also be used in non-bold contexts, such as in bullet lists or for horizontal rules. Distinguishing these from actual bold formatting could be challenging.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to be displayed as literal characters rather than formatting, which should not be misinterpreted as bold text.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Some Markdown processors support bold text that spans multiple lines, which might complicate the extraction process if the parser is designed to work line by line.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: There could be syntax errors in the Markdown file where the bold formatting is not properly closed, leading to incorrect or incomplete extractions.\n\n7. **Overlapping Formatting**: Sometimes bold formatting might overlap with other formatting (like italic), and distinguishing them could be tricky.\n\nDealing with these potential difficulties would require a robust parsing strategy and possibly regular expressions or a state machine to accurately extract the bold text while considering the context of each use of asterisks or underscores."
