The parser needs to recognize both syntaxes.\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might be nested within other elements like links (`[**bold text**](URL)`), or other formatting elements like italics might be nested within bold (`**text *italic* text**`), which could complicate extraction.\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes the asterisks or underscores might be escaped (preceded by a backslash) to indicate they are not formatting characters, but rather literal characters (`\\**not bold\\**`), and these should not be extracted as bold.\n4. **False Positives**: There might be instances where asterisks or underscores are used in the text but not meant for bold formatting, such as in mathematical expressions or in code blocks. These should not be considered as bold.\n5. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes the markers for bold might be incomplete or mismatched (e.g., `**bold*` or `*bold**`), which can cause issues in correctly identifying the bold text.\n6. **Line Breaks**: The bold text might span multiple lines, and handling line breaks properly is necessary to ensure complete extraction of the text.\n7. **Multi-Paragraph Bold**: Rarely, but possibly, an entire paragraph or multiple paragraphs could be bolded, and the parser must handle such cases.\n\nThese are some potential issues that would need to be addressed when parsing the Markdown file to extract the bold texts correctly."
