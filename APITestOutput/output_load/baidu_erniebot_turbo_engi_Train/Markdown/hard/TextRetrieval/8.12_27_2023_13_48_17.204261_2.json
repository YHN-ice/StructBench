However, some Markdown flavors might have slight variations, which could complicate the parsing.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Sometimes Markdown files can include HTML tags. If an image is included with an `<img>` tag instead of Markdown syntax, it might be missed unless the parser also accounts for HTML.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image description but instead is placed elsewhere in the document with a reference ID. This can make it harder to associate the image file name with the actual image link.\n\n4. **Link Definitions Inside Code Blocks**: If there are code blocks that contain image link definitions, they should not be interpreted as actual images to be extracted.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: The parser needs to handle escaped characters properly, where an exclamation mark followed by brackets might not necessarily indicate an image if the exclamation mark is escaped.\n\n6. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links can be either relative or absolute paths. The parser should be able to extract both types of paths effectively.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There could be lines with multiple images included, and the parser should be able to extract each image file name separately.\n\n8. **Broken Syntax**: In some cases, there might be typos or broken syntax which could look like an image link but isn't correctly formatted as per Markdown standards.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might have nested Markdown elements like links or emphasis inside their alt text, which could complicate the parsing.\n\n10. **Non-image Files**: Sometimes links to non-image files (like PDFs or documents) could be formatted similarly to image files, so the parser must differentiate based on file extensions or other indicators.\n\n11. **Different File Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser needs to recognize all common image formats.\n\n12. **Capturing Alt Text and Title Attributes**: While extracting image paths, it's important to decide whether to capture just the path or also include any alt text or title attributes that might be present.\n\nNow let's proceed with the actual task of parsing the Markdown content.
