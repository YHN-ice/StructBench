Commonly, double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` are used to wrap text that should be bold. The parser must recognize both patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold text in Markdown might contain other formatted text, like links or italicized text. The parser must handle nested elements correctly and only extract the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes, asterisks or underscores may be escaped with a backslash to display them literally, rather than using them for formatting. The parser must distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting:** Users might make mistakes in their Markdown, such as using only one asterisk instead of two or forgetting a closing asterisk. The parser needs to decide how to handle these incomplete formatting cases.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Whitespace:** Line breaks and white spaces could affect how the Markdown is parsed. For example, line breaks within bold text should be handled so that the extracted text remains continuous.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text:** Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines, so the parser must be able to extract text that is spread across several lines without breaking the formatting.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, the parser will need to handle these potential difficulties to accurately extract all bold texts."
