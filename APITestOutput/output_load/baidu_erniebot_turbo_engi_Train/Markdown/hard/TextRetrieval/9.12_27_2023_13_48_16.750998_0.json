We have to account for both to ensure we capture all bold texts.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might include other formatting like italics or inline code. We need to be cautious not to include these markers in the extracted text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes the bold syntax might be escaped to display literal asterisks or underscores rather than bolding text (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which we shouldn't treat as bold.\n\n4. **Links and images**: The bold syntax could be within a link or an image's alt text. We need to decide whether to include these and if so, how to handle them.\n\n5. **Partial bolding**: Parts of a word or sentence might be bolded (e.g., `normal **bold** normal`), which should be considered when extracting.\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code**: Bold syntax within code blocks or inline code should not be treated as formatting. We should ignore these.\n\n7. **Multiline bold text**: Markdown can support multiline formatting, so we need to be able to detect bold text that spans multiple lines.\n\n8. **Inconsistent formatting**: There may be inconsistent use of whitespace around the asterisks or underscores that could affect pattern matching.\n\nTo address these difficulties, we would typically use regex patterns that can capture the desired bold text while excluding false positives. We might also employ a Markdown parsing library that can abstract some of these complexities away.\n\nNow please provide the Markdown file content for which you want to extract the bold text, and I'll demonstrate how to parse them out."
