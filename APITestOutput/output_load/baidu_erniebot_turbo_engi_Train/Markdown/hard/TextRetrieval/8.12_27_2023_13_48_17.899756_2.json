Only filenames from relative paths should typically be extracted since absolute URLs do not point to actual files within the Markdown document's directory.\n\n3. **Embedded URLs**: Sometimes, image URLs might be embedded within another element or obfuscated, which could make it more difficult to extract just the filename.\n\n4. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown parsers support extensions that allow for more complex image handling (like resizing or classes). These might not follow the standard Markdown syntax and could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n5. **Non-image Links**: Not all links with an exclamation mark are necessarily images (though this is rare); they could be custom Markdown extensions or misformatted links.\n\n6. **Multi-line Definitions**: The link for an image might be split across multiple lines, which complicates parsing since a simple line-by-line approach might not correctly identify the image link.\n\n7. **Image Title Attributes**: Titles can be added to the image syntax in Markdown, usually after the URL and inside double quotes. Care must be taken not to mistake these for part of the file name.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Filenames might include characters that are typically escaped in Markdown, like spaces or parentheses, and need to be handled correctly.\n\n9. **Link References**: Images might use reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image tag but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n10. **File Extensions**: Different image file types (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.) should be recognized and not confused with other types of files or URLs without an extension."
