We would need to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements inside it, such as italics, code blocks, or links. We would need to discern between nested elements and the bold markers themselves.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the bold markers might be escaped so that they are displayed as literal asterisks or underscores rather than making the text bold. For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n4. **Inline vs. Block Elements**: Bold text could be within a line or at the beginning/end of a block element like a paragraph or header. We would need to properly parse inline and block elements.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are also used for other formatting like lists, italics, and horizontal rules. We need to ensure we're not mistakenly identifying those as bold text.\n\n6. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, the markers for bold text might not be correctly paired (e.g., missing an asterisk at the end). We would need to decide how to handle these incomplete markers.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text**: In some flavors of Markdown, bold text can span multiple lines. This could complicate extraction as we can't simply rely on line-by-line parsing.\n\n8. **Overlapping Formatting**: Bold text could overlap with other formatting, such as a bold section inside an italicized section, which might complicate parsing without context.\n\nTo extract all bold texts accurately, we need a parser that can handle these nuances and provide just the raw texts without any surrounding Markdown syntax."
