We need to account for both possibilities.\n\n2. **Nested Markdown Elements:** Bold text might have other Markdown elements nested inside it, such as links, italics, or inline code. The parser needs to handle these cases without breaking the bold syntax.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being parsed as bold, like `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be recognized as bold.\n\n4. **Incomplete Syntax:** There might be instances where the syntax for bold is not correctly closed, such as `**bold`. Depending on requirements, these may or may not be considered as bold text.\n\n5. **False Positives:** Text that looks like bold syntax but is not meant to be bold due to surrounding context (such as in a code block or inline code) should not be extracted.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Texts:** Bold text might span multiple lines, which can be challenging to capture if the parser is designed to work on a single line basis.\n\n7. **Performance Issues:** If the Markdown file is very large, it might lead to performance issues when parsing the file for bold texts.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parser must be robust and able to correctly identify the start and end of bold texts, considering all valid Markdown syntax variations and edge cases. It may require a combination of regular expressions and Markdown syntax rules to accurately extract the bold texts."
