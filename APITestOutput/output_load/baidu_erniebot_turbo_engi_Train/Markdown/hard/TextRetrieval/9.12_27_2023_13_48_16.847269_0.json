The parser must recognize all the syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text may also have nested formatting, such as italicized words (`***bold and italic***` or `___bold and italic___`). The parser needs to extract the bold text while handling or ignoring the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: If the syntax for bold is escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), it should not be treated as bold text. The parser must correctly identify and ignore escaped formatting.\n\n4. **Inline code blocks and code fences**: Bold syntax within inline code blocks (using backticks \\`like this\\`) or fenced code blocks (triple backticks) should not be treated as formatted text, as formatting is ignored within code blocks.\n\n5. **False positives**: Some non-bold uses of asterisks or underscores may be mistakenly identified as bold, such as bullet points or horizontal rules.\n\n6. **Partial matches**: Situations where only part of the bold syntax is present could lead to incorrect extraction (e.g., `**bold` without a closing `**`).\n\n7. **Incorrect nesting**: Incorrectly nested formatting (e.g., `**bold _italic bold** italic_`) might lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n8. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text that spans multiple lines might not be correctly identified if the parser does not account for multiline formatting.\n\nTo address these difficulties, the parser must implement logic to accurately identify and handle these scenarios to extract only the intended bold text. Now I'm ready to see the input file and proceed with extracting the bold texts as requested."
