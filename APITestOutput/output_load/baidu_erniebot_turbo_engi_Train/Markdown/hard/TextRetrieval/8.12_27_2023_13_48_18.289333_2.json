The most common one is `![Alt text](URL)` where `URL` can be a path to a file or a web URL. We need to ensure that we account for variations in this syntax.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images**: Apart from the inline image insertion, images can also be included using reference-style links. This involves placing an image reference somewhere in the document like `![Alt text][id]` and then defining the link at another place with `[id]: URL \"Optional title\"`. We must handle this case as well.\n\n3. **Images with Titles**: Some images are included with additional titles or hover text like `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`. Parsing needs to account for optional titles as well.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: In Markdown, characters like `!` or `[]` can be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to avoid being treated as Markdown syntax. We need to ensure we do not confuse escaped syntax with actual image syntax.\n\n5. **Relative and Absolute URLs**: Image URLs could be either relative paths to files within the same repository or system or absolute URLs pointing to an external resource. We need to extract these accurately.\n\n6. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes Markdown files can have embedded HTML tags, including `<img>` tags for including images. A comprehensive parser should be able to handle this too, even though it's not standard Markdown syntax.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Image links could be nested inside other Markdown elements, such as lists or blockquotes. This can complicate the parsing process.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Other parts of the text could accidentally match the pattern we use to find image links if we are not careful with our pattern matching.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges helps us approach parsing with care to ensure we correctly extract all image links without false positives or negatives. Now, let's see the input file so we can identify and extract the image filenames accurately."
