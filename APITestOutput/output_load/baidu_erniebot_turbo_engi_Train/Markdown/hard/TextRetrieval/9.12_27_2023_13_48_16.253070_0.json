Here are a few potential difficulties:\n\n1. **Different Syntax for Bold**: Markdown supports different syntaxes for bold text, including double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser must recognize both.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain nested elements like links `[text](url)`, inline code `` `code` ``, or even other bold or italic markers. The parser must be able to handle these without breaking the extraction.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks and underscores might be escaped with a backslash to indicate they are not formatting characters (e.g., `\\**not bold**`), and these should not be confused with actual bold syntax.\n\n4. **Multiple Bold Sections on One Line**: A single line might contain multiple bold sections with normal text in between. The parser should extract all these sections separately.\n\n5. **Line Breaks Inside Bold Text**: There might be line breaks within bold text, especially if the Markdown is manually line-wrapped or formatted with hard breaks.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: In some cases, the Markdown might be inconsistently formatted, such as missing a closing asterisk or underscore, which could lead to incorrect or incomplete extraction.\n\n7. **Ambiguity with Italic**: A single asterisk `*text*` or underscore `_text_` is used for italics in Markdown, and sometimes users mistakenly use these instead of double symbols for bold, leading to confusion.\n\n8. **Code Blocks**: Bold syntax within code blocks should not be parsed as bold since it's part of a code snippet and should be ignored by the Markdown renderer.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, the parser needs to handle all these potential issues and still correctly identify and separate the bold parts of the Markdown content."
