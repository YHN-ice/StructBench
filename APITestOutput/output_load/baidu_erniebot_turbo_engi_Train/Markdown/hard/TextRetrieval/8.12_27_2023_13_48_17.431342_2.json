It's important to recognize all the patterns, such as `![Alt text](URL)` and reference-style images.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images in Markdown can be linked with both relative and absolute paths. We need to be able to capture both types.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes images might be embedded using raw HTML within the Markdown file. This can complicate the parsing as we would need to look for `<img>` tags as well.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, image syntax might be escaped, indicating that it should not be treated as an actual image. We need to differentiate between actual image links and escaped ones.\n\n5. **Link References Located Elsewhere**: The image URLs might not be inline but instead referenced at a different place in the document. This requires tracking reference-style links.\n\n6. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There may be multiple images included in a single line of Markdown. The parser needs to correctly identify and extract each individual image file name.\n\n7. **File Name Extraction**: Once the image URLs are identified, the actual file names need to be extracted, which means disregarding the rest of the URL and focusing on the last part after the last slash `/`.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Ensuring that non-image files or URLs that happen to have an exclamation mark followed by brackets aren't mistakenly identified as images.\n\nPlease provide the input file or the specific content you'd like me to parse so I can extract all included image file names."
