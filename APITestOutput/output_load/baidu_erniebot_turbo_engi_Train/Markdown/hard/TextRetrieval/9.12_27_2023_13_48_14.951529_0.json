A parser needs to recognize both patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested within other elements, like links `[**text**](URL)` or emphasis `**_text_**`. The parser must handle these cases without capturing the surrounding formatting elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the asterisks or underscores meant to indicate bold formatting can be escaped with a backslash to display literally (`\\**not bold\\**`), which the parser should not interpret as bold.\n\n4. **In-line Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (`` `code` ``) should not be parsed for markdown formatting. Bold syntax within code blocks should be ignored.\n\n5. **Code Fences**: Similar to inline code blocks, code fenced by triple backticks (```) should be ignored when parsing for bold text.\n\n6. **Lists and Blockquotes**: Bold text might appear within lists or blockquotes, and the parser needs to correctly identify these instances.\n\n7. **Partial Bold**: Sometimes, only part of a word or phrase might be in bold, such as `**bold**text`, which the parser must handle correctly.\n\n8. **Incomplete Formatting**: If the bold formatting is not properly completed (e.g., missing an asterisk), it shouldn't be considered as bold.\n\n9. **Multi-line Bold**: Bold formatting can span multiple lines, and the parser must be able to detect and extract such instances.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful parsing and potentially complex regular expressions or stateful parsing to accurately extract the bold texts while ignoring false positives."
