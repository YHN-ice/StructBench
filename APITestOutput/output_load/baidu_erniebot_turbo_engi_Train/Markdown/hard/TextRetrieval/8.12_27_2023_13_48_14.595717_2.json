However, there can be variations or errors in the syntax, like missing exclamation marks, alt text, or brackets.\n\n2. **Image Formats**: Images can come in various formats such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. It's important to identify all common image file formats.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using absolute URLs (starting with `http://` or `https://`) or relative file paths. The parser must handle both.\n\n4. **Inline vs Reference Style Links**: Markdown allows for images to be included using inline links or reference-style links. The parser should be able to extract image file names from both.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes images are embedded using HTML tags within Markdown files. The parser may need to recognize `<img>` tags.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: We might encounter escaped characters that could affect how URLs are parsed.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Image links might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There could be lines with more than one image link, and the parser should extract all of them.\n\nNow that we've considered potential issues let's proceed with extracting the image file names once you provide the Markdown input."
