The most common methods are using double asterisks `**text**` or double underscores `__text__`. We must recognize and handle both possibilities.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold syntax might contain other Markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, code `code`, or italics `*text*`. These nested elements should be handled correctly while extracting the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores could be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to indicate that they should be treated as literal characters, not as Markdown syntax. We need to ignore such escaped characters when parsing for bold text.\n\n4. **Incomplete Syntax**: In some cases, the Markdown file might have incomplete syntax like `**text` or `text**` which does not actually make the text bold in rendered Markdown. We need to decide whether to include these as bold text or not.\n\n5. **Multiple Bold Sections on the Same Line**: There might be multiple bold sections separated by other text within the same line. Each of these should be extracted separately.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and we need to account for that when parsing.\n\n7. **Literal Asterisks or Underscores in Text**: There might be literal asterisks or underscores that should not be interpreted as bold syntax, often used in a list or for emphasis in plaintext.\n\n8. **Whitespace Handling**: There might be whitespace immediately after the opening `**` or before the closing `**` which can sometimes trip up simplistic parsing logic.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust Markdown parsing algorithm or regular expression can be used to accurately identify and extract bold texts from the document."
