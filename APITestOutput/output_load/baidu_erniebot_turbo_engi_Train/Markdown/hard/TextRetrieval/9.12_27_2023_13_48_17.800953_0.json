The most common are double asterisks `**text**` and double underscores `__text__`. The parser must handle both equally.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might include other Markdown formatting inside it, such as italic, code, or links. The parser should be able to extract the bold text without including the formatting markers for such nested styles.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Asterisks or underscores used in other contexts might be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which the parser needs to consider.\n\n4. **Erroneous Formatting:** There might be incorrect Markdown formatting in the file, such as unbalanced or mismatched asterisks or underscores. The parser should decide how to handle these cases—whether to attempt to recover and extract what seems to be intended as bold or to ignore malformed formatting.\n\n5. **Line Breaks:** Markdown allows for line breaks inside bold text when using double spaces at the end of a line or backslashes. The parser would need to handle these correctly and ensure that the extracted text still makes sense without the Markdown-specific line break notation.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks and inline code should not be considered as formatted text, so the parser must distinguish code segments from regular text to avoid false positives.\n\n7. **Performance Issues:** Depending on the size of the input file and the complexity of its content, performance might be an issue. Parsing large files with numerous instances of bold (and other) formatting might require efficient algorithms.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the parser would need to be robust and carefully designed to handle various Markdown use cases and edge cases accurately."
