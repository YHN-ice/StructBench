However, variations in this syntax, like omitting the alt text or title, or using reference-style links, could complicate the extraction process.\n\n2. **Variety of Image File Types**: Images can come in various formats such as .jpg, .png, .gif, .svg, etc. The parser must be able to recognize all these types and more.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Image sources can be either relative paths or absolute URLs. We should be able to extract the file name in either case.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, images might be embedded using HTML tags within a Markdown file. The parser needs to identify these as well if instructed.\n\n5. **Link Confusion**: Distinguishing between links to web pages and links directly to image files is necessary. Not all URLs in a Markdown file will point to images.\n\n6. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There could be more than one image on a single line, and the parser must handle these cases without missing any images.\n\n7. **Image References**: Markdown allows for the use of reference-style image links where the URL is not inline with the image tag. These references must be resolved to extract the correct file name.\n\nBy acknowledging these challenges, we can be better prepared to accurately parse the Markdown file and extract all included image files. Now we can move on to inspecting the input file and extracting the image file names."
