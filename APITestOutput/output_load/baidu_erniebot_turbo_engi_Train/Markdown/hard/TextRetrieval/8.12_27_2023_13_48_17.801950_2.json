We need to handle all common variations.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute paths**: Image paths in Markdown can be either relative to the document or absolute URLs. We need to distinguish these and decide if the question pertains to extracting just the file names or the entire path.\n\n3. **Images within HTML tags**: Sometimes, images are embedded using HTML tags within a Markdown file, and this will require a different parsing strategy.\n\n4. **Link references**: Markdown allows for images to be included with reference links, where the actual URL is provided elsewhere in the document. This means we may have to parse the entire document to resolve all image paths.\n\n5. **Nested syntax**: Images might be part of complex nested structures, like inside links, lists, or tables, which could make the parsing a bit more challenging.\n\n6. **Escaped characters**: Image syntax could contain escaped characters that should not be interpreted as Markdown syntax; we need to handle these cases properly.\n\n7. **False positives**: There could be text within the document that looks like an image link but isn't meant to be one, such as examples of Markdown syntax or commented out lines.\n   \n8. **File name extraction**: If the image paths include directories, we may need to extract just the file names from these paths.\n\nOvercoming these obstacles requires careful consideration of the Markdown format and potentially robust regex patterns or a Markdown parsing library that can handle the complexity of Markdown syntax."
