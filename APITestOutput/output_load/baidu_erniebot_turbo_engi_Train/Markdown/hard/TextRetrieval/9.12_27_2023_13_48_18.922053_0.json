The parser must recognize all syntax variants.\n2. **Nested Emphasis:** Bold text might be nested within other Markdown elements like links `[**text**](URL)` or italics `*__text__*`. The parser must be able to extract bold text from within other elements.\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes bold syntax characters might be escaped to show literal asterisks or underscores, like `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser must not confuse these with actual bold syntax.\n4. **False Positives:** There might be cases where asterisks or underscores are used in the text, but not for the purpose of bold formatting, such as in code blocks or inline code, where text is not meant to be bold.\n5. **Incomplete Syntax:** There could be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed, such as `**text`, which should not be considered bold.\n6. **Multiline Bold Texts:** If a bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must be able to handle and extract it completely.\n7. **Nested Bold Texts:** Bold text might be nested within another bold text, which could complicate extraction.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parser would need to be robust enough to correctly interpret the Markdown syntax and discern what constitutes bold text in various contexts. Now, if you provide the input file, I can proceed with extracting the bold texts as per the mentioned requirements."
