Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Different Syntax for Bold:** Markdown allows for multiple ways to denote bold text, typically using double asterisks `**bold**` or double underscores `__bold__`. The parser must handle all possible syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might contain other formatting elements, such as italics, code, or links. The parser should be able to extract the bold text while handling or ignoring nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** The presence of escaped characters like `\\**not bold\\**` can be a pitfall if the parser does not correctly identify and ignore them.\n\n4. **False Positives:** Asterisks and underscores are also used for other formatting purposes, such as bullet points or emphasis. The parser must distinguish between these uses and actual bold text.\n\n5. **Incomplete Markers:** Occasionally, bold markers may not be correctly paired (e.g., `**bold`). The parser should decide whether to consider these as bold or not.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text:** Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser needs to be able to handle multiline formatting properly.\n\n7. **Variations in Markdown Flavors:** There are different \"flavors\" of Markdown, such as GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) or CommonMark, which may have slight syntax differences. The parser should ideally be compatible with the version of Markdown used in the input file.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser needs to be robust and flexible to accurately extract bold text from a variety of Markdown documents."
