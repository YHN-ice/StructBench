Potential variations in syntax might make it difficult to accurately capture all image references.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Images can also be included using raw HTML within Markdown documents (e.g., `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"description\" />`). This could complicate extraction since it requires parsing HTML as well as Markdown.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image references might be given as absolute URLs, relative paths, or even base64 encoded data. Distinguishing between file names and URLs would be necessary to extract only the file names.\n\n4. **Link References**: Markdown allows for images to be included through reference links where the URL is not directly with the image tag but is instead defined elsewhere in the document (e.g., `![Alt text][id]` with `[id]: URL` defined elsewhere). This means the parser must keep track of these references and resolve them accordingly.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: If the Markdown contains escaped characters that resemble image syntax, they should not be mistaken for actual image links.\n\n6. **Nested Content**: In some Markdown processors, you can have nested content (like images inside lists or block quotes). Ensuring images are extracted from these contexts is important.\n\n7. **Invalid Links**: Some image links might be malformed or invalid. Deciding how to handle these cases (i.e., to ignore them or report them) is necessary.\n\n8. **Non-Image Files**: Links to non-image files may also be present, so distinguishing between image file extensions and others is critical.\n\nWith these potential difficulties in mind, I would parse the Markdown file by looking for patterns that match the typical syntaxes used for including images, handling inline HTML tags, and resolving reference-style links appropriately. Also, I would ensure that the text being parsed as an image link actually represents an image by checking for common image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif)."
