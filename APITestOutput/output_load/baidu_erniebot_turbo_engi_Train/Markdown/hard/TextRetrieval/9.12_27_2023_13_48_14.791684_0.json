The parser needs to recognize both.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting nested within it, such as italicized words (`*italic*` or `_italic_`) or inline code blocks (`` `code` ``). The parser must extract only the bold text, not the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users might escape asterisks or underscores (e.g., `\\**not bold**`) to prevent them from being parsed as formatting. The parser should not treat escaped characters as formatting delimiters.\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting**: Sometimes, users forget to close the bold formatting by missing an asterisk or an underscore (e.g., `**bold`). The parser must decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Line breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, so the parser needs to be able to handle line breaks within bold segments.\n\n6. **Different Markdown flavors**: There are different Markdown flavors, such as GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM) or CommonMark. They may have slight differences in how they handle formatting, and the parser might need to account for these differences.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help in implementing a Markdown parser that can robustly extract bold texts."
