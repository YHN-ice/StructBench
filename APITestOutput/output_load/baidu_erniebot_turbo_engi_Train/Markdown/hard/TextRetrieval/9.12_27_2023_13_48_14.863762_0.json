We need to be able to recognize and handle all variations.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, links, or lists. We'll have to ensure that we only extract the bold text and not the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. Escaped characters: Sometimes, the Markdown syntax for bold might be escaped (like `**`), which means it's not actually denoting bold text but should be treated as plain text.\n\n4. Partial formatting: There may be incorrect or incomplete Markdown syntax that looks like bold formatting but isn't, such as a single asterisk (`*`) or an unpaired double asterisk (`**bold text`).\n\n5. Code blocks and inline code: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) or inline code (enclosed by single backticks `) should not be treated as formatted text, even if it contains characters that would otherwise signify bold text.\n\n6. Overlapping formatting: Sometimes, formatting can overlap in complex ways, such as bold text within a section of italicized text, which would require careful parsing to accurately extract the desired parts.\n\nThese challenges will require careful consideration and robust parsing logic to ensure accurate extraction of only the bold text from the Markdown file."
