A parser needs to recognize all these patterns.\n\n2. **Bold within other elements**: Bold text might be within other elements like links (`[**bold link**](URL)`), or within list items, headings, or blockquotes. It is important to identify bold text within these structures without accidentally capturing non-bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes the bold markers might be escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they shouldn't be treated as bold formatting. The parser needs to differentiate between actual bold syntax and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Inline code blocks**: Bold syntax within inline code blocks (`` ` ` ``) should not be considered as bold text, since anything within inline code blocks is treated as literal text.\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: The Markdown syntax might be spread across multiple lines, which could complicate the regex or parsing logic.\n\n6. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting nested inside it, like italics, strikethrough, or inline code, which should be accounted for during extraction.\n\n7. **Partial formatting**: Sometimes only part of a word or sentence might be formatted as bold, which requires careful extraction to avoid including non-bold text.\n\n8. **Ambiguities and inconsistencies**: Markdown doesn't have a strict specification and different parsers might interpret the syntax slightly differently, leading to ambiguities in how to handle certain cases.\n\n9. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is large with many instances of bold text, the parser must work efficiently to extract all instances without significant lag.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts from a markdown file, a parser must correctly handle all the above scenarios."
