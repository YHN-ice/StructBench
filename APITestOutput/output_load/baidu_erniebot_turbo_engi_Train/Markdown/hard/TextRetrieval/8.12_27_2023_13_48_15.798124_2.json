The parser must handle all variations.\n\n2. **Handling relative and absolute paths**: Image source URLs can be either relative paths or absolute URLs. The parser needs to differentiate and extract the file names correctly in both cases.\n\n3. **Dealing with embedded HTML**: Since Markdown supports inline HTML, images can also be embedded using `<img>` tags. A comprehensive parser should account for this possibility.\n\n4. **Links vs. Images**: Markdown syntax for links and images is similar; the difference is an exclamation mark before the brackets for images (`![]()`). The parser must distinguish between them accurately.\n\n5. **Various image file extensions**: There are multiple image file formats like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg`, etc. The parser should recognize all possible image extensions.\n\n6. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, characters in Markdown might be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as Markdown syntax, which can affect the parsing process.\n\n7. **Reference-style links**: Images may be included using reference-style links, where the URL reference is defined elsewhere in the document. The parser will need to locate these references and extract the file names accordingly.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown elements**: Images could potentially be nested within other elements, like lists or blockquotes, which may complicate extraction.\n\n9. **Incomplete or malformed Markdown**: The input might contain errors or incomplete Markdown syntax, and the parser should handle these gracefully.\n\n10. **Filters and parameters**: Some image URLs might include filters or parameters after the file extension (e.g., `image.png?s=200`). The parser needs to consider these and decide whether to include or exclude them as part of the file name.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll be able to apply these considerations to accurately extract all included image file names."
