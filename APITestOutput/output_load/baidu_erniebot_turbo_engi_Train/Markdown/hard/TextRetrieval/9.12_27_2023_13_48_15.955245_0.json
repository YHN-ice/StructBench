The parser must be able to handle all acceptable syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested elements**: Bold text in Markdown can contain other formatting elements, like links (`[link text](url)`), italics (`*italic*` or `_italic_`), code snippets (`` `code` ``), etc. The parser needs to differentiate between the bold markers and other markers that might be nested within.\n\n3. **False positives**: Asterisks and underscores might be used in the document for purposes other than bold formatting, such as bullet points or horizontal rules. The parser must distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), meaning they should not be treated as formatting characters. The parser has to recognize and correctly handle escaped characters.\n\n5. **Incomplete markers**: There might be instances where the formatting is not correctly applied, such as missing one asterisk in a pair supposed to make the text bold (e.g., `**bold*`). The parser has to decide how to handle these incomplete markers.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text**: Markdown does not generally support multiline bold text unless each line is individually wrapped in bold markers. However, if a parser is designed to work with non-standard Markdown or if there are line breaks within a paragraph, it may need to handle this case.\n\n7. **Contextual interpretation**: Text editors or Markdown renderers might have specific implementations for how they interpret bold syntax, and a parser might need to be aware of such contextual rules or common practices to provide correct results.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing these potential difficulties will be important for parsing the given Markdown file and extracting all bold texts accurately."
