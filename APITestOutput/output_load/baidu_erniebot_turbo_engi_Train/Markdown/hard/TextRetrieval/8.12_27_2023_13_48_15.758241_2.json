The standard format for embedding an image is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. However, variations may occur if the alt text or title is omitted or if non-standard syntax is used.\n\n2. **URL Types**: Images can be linked from external sources or included as relative file paths. Ensuring that the parser recognizes both types is necessary.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style links and images, where the URL is not inline but rather defined elsewhere in the document. Parsing these correctly requires additional logic to match the references with their definitions.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, images are embedded using raw HTML instead of Markdown syntax. A parser that only looks for Markdown syntax might miss these.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: If the image syntax includes escape characters to display literal brackets or parentheses, the parser will need to handle these correctly.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown**: An image link could be nested within other Markdown elements, like a list or blockquote, which might complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Incorrect Formatting**: Any improper formatting, like missing brackets or parentheses, could lead to images not being recognized by the parser.\n\nTo extract image file names accurately, the parser should be robust enough to handle these complexities and any other non-standard uses of Markdown."
