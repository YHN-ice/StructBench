Differentiating between bold and italic text, as italic text uses single asterisks or underscores (e.g., `*italic*` or `_italic_`).\n2. Handling cases where asterisks or underscores are used in the text for reasons other than formatting, such as in a code block, inline code segment, or when they are escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`).\n3. Dealing with nested formatting where bold text might contain italicized sections or other Markdown elements.\n4. Accounting for variations in whitespace surrounding the asterisks or underscores which might occur due to user error or non-standard usage.\n5. Extracting the raw text without including the Markdown formatting characters.\n6. Ensuring that the parser can handle multiline bold text if the Markdown flavor allows it.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser needs to precisely identify the patterns that represent bold text while excluding false positives. It should also be robust enough to handle edge cases and markdown nuances."
