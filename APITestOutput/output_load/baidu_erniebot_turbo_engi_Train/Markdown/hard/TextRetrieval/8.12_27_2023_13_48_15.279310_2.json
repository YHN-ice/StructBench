Depending on the question, you might need to differentiate between them or treat them equally.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown supports embedded HTML, so an image could potentially be included using an `<img>` tag instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Reference-style links**: Some Markdown files use reference-style links, where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Non-standard markdown extensions**: There are many flavors of Markdown, and some might have extensions that alter or add to the standard image syntax.\n\n6. **Text that looks like an image link**: Sometimes there are false positives, where text follows a pattern similar to an image link but isn't one, such as a broken image link or an image link commented out.\n\n7. **Handling multiple images on the same line**: There could be multiple images on a single line, so the parser should be able to handle this scenario without merging the file names or paths.\n\n8. **Image links containing Markdown syntax characters**: Sometimes, image URLs or file names might contain parentheses, square brackets, or other characters used by Markdown syntax, which can complicate parsing.\n\n9. **Escaped characters**: Markdown allows for characters to be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as syntax, so any escape characters would need to be considered during parsing.\n\n10. **Links without images**: Sometimes there might be links that are not images but could be confused with them, such as links ending in `.md` instead of an image extension like `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.\n\n11. **Invalid image syntax**: The document might contain errors or typos in the image syntax which could lead to incorrectly parsing or missing an image file name.\n\nPreparing to handle these potential issues will help in accurately parsing the Markdown file and extracting the correct image file names."
