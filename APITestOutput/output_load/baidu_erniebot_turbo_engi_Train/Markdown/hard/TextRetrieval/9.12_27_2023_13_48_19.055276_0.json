However, there could be a few difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italicized text, lists, or blockquotes. This could make it challenging to accurately extract just the bold portions.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters:** The Markdown syntax for bold (e.g., `**text**`) could be escaped (e.g., `\\**text\\**`), meaning it's not meant to be interpreted as bold. Ensuring these cases are handled correctly is important.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Use of Markers:** Users might inconsistently use `*`, `_`, `**`, or `__` for bold formatting, or use them incorrectly (e.g., `**bold*`), which would complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Alternate Syntax:** Some Markdown flavors allow alternate syntaxes for bold text. For example, some may consider `***text***` to denote bold and italic, or only italics. Recognizing and handling these correctly can be a challenge.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks (` ``` `) or inline code (`` ` ``) should not be treated as formatted text. Bold markers within these should be ignored.\n\n6. **Link Descriptions:** Markdown link descriptions might contain bold markers. It's important to decide if bold text within link descriptions should be extracted or not.\n\n7. **Partial Markers:** Situations where only one side of the text has the bold marker (e.g., `**bold`) need to be handled as they are not actually bold in Markdown.\n\n8. **Multiline Bold Text:** In some Markdown processors, bold text can span multiple lines. Deciding whether to support this and how to handle line breaks in the output can be tricky.\n\nAfter considering these potential obstacles, I'll need the actual input Markdown file to proceed with extracting the bold texts."
