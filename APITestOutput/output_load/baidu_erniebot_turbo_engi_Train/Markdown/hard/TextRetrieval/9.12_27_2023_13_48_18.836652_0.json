The most common are double asterisks `**text**` or double underscores `__text__`.

These should not be confused with actual bold text.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and In-line Code:** Text inside code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented with four spaces) and inline code (surrounded by single backticks `) should not be formatted, so bold syntax within these should be ignored.\n\n6. **False Positives:** Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be used in the text not for formatting but as part of the content (e.g., in mathematical expressions). These instances should not be treated as bold text.\n\n7. **Overlapping or Adjacent Formats:** There might be bold text immediately followed by or adjacent to other formatted text without clear separation, which might complicate extraction.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, we must consider these potential difficulties and ensure our parser is robust against these complexities."
