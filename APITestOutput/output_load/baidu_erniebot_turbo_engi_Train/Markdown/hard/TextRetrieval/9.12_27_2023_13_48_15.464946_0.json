Both need to be recognized and handled.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold text might contain other Markdown elements inside it, such as links `[link](url)`, italics, or code spans. These nested elements could complicate the extraction of just the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Asterisks or underscores that are meant to be displayed as literal characters rather than Markdown indicators (escaped with a backslash, like `\\**not bold\\**`) should not be confused with actual bold syntax.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Paired Markers:** Unmatched or incorrectly paired bold markers (e.g., `**bold __text**` or `**bold*`) might be found in the document, potentially causing parsing errors.\n\n5. **Inline Code Blocks:** Bold markers within inline code blocks (using backticks `` ` ``) should be ignored, as they are not meant to render as bold in the final document.\n\n6. **Line Breaks:** Bold text that spans across multiple lines may pose a challenge, as some parsers might expect the bold markers to be on the same line.\n\n7. **Ambiguity with Emphasis:** Single asterisks or underscores are used for emphasis (italic text), which is distinct from bold text. The parser needs to distinguish between these based on the number of markers.\n\nGiven these potential issues, it is important to have a robust parsing strategy that can accurately identify bold text within a Markdown file while handling edge cases and Markdown's flexible syntax."
