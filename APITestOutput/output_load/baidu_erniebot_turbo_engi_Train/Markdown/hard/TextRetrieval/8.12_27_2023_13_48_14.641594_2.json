You would need to be aware of and handle different possible syntaxes users might employ.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths:** Images in Markdown can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. An absolute path points directly to the location of a file, while a relative path specifies the file's location relative to the current working directory. Extracting the file names may require handling both types of paths.\n\n3. **Handling of title texts:** Sometimes images in Markdown have title texts that could complicate the extraction of the file name if not properly parsed.\n\n4. **Embedded base64 images:** Markdown allows for embedding images directly with base64 encoding. These do not have traditional file names, but rather the image data is embedded directly into the document.\n\n5. **Non-image URLs:** Not every URL in a Markdown document points to an image file. You will need to distinguish between image URLs and other types of links.\n\n6. **File name with spaces or special characters:** File names can sometimes contain spaces or special characters, which must be correctly identified and extracted without truncation or misinterpretation.\n\n7. **Link references:** Markdown allows for defining image references elsewhere in the document, so you would need to find and resolve these references to extract the correct file names.\n\n8. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files may contain inline HTML with `<img>` tags that could contain image files, adding another layer of complexity to parsing.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, these potential difficulties will guide us in how to approach parsing the Markdown content to extract all included image file names."
