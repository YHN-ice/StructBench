The two common ones are inline-style (`![alt text](image_url \"title\")`) and reference-style (`![alt text][reference]`). Variations in these formats might complicate the extraction process.\n\n2. **Embedding URL with Parameters**: Sometimes, image URLs might contain additional parameters or fragments which may need to be handled or ignored depending on the requirement.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images might be included using relative paths or absolute URLs. If the task is to extract only the file names, one needs to differentiate between the path and the actual file name.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: Some image URLs might be URL-encoded, requiring decoding to get the actual file name.\n\n5. **Markdown Links vs Images**: Markdown syntax for links and images is similar. Ensuring that we're extracting image file names and not link URLs is crucial.\n\n6. **Image References**: In reference-style images, the actual URL is detached from the image placeholder and is typically placed elsewhere in the document. We need to match these references with their corresponding URLs.\n\n7. **Text in Code Blocks or Inline Code**: Text representing an image within code blocks (indented with 4 spaces or fenced by triple backticks) or inline code (wrapped in backticks) should not be treated as an actual image embed.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows escaping of special characters that might be part of the actual file name but escaped in the document.\n\n9. **File Extensions**: Assuming only certain file extensions are valid for images (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), there might be other non-image files linked in the markdown that we need to filter out.\n\n10. **Nested Markdown Elements**: If alt text or titles contain markdown elements or nested links, parsing might become more complex.\n\nUnderstanding these obstacles will help tailor the extraction process to be as accurate as possible when parsing the input file for image names."
