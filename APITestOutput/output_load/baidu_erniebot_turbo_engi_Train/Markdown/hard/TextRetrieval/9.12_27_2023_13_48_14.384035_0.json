Parsing this correctly to extract just the bold text without the nested emphasis can be tricky.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Markdown allows users to escape characters that would normally be parsed as formatting, such as `\\**not bold\\**`, which should not be detected as bold.\n\n4. **In-line code blocks**: Text within an in-line code block using backticks (`` ` ``) should not be interpreted as bold, even if it contains double asterisks or underscores.\n\n5. **Fenced code blocks**: Similar to in-line code blocks, text within fenced code blocks (``` ``` or `~~~`) should not be interpreted as bold.\n\n6. **Partial formatting markers**: Sometimes, users may forget to close formatting with the correct number of asterisks or underscores (`**bold*`) which could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n7. **Line breaks**: Bold formatting can span multiple lines, and the parser needs to correctly handle line continuation for bold text.\n\n8. **Links and images**: The Markdown syntax for links (`[text](URL)`) and images (`![alt-text](URL)`) may contain asterisks or underscores that are not meant to indicate bold text.\n\n9. **List items and blockquotes**: Bold text can be within list items (`- **bold**`) or blockquotes (`> **bold**`), which should also be parsed correctly.\n\nFor each of these potential issues, the parser must have rules or logic to handle them appropriately to ensure only the correct bold text is extracted."
