The standard syntax is `![Alt text](URL)`, but variations or shorthand versions could exist depending on the Markdown dialect in use.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative to the document or absolute URLs. Determining the actual file names of relative paths might require additional context regarding the document's location.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style links and images, where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document. Recognizing and resolving these will be essential.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown documents embed raw HTML for more complex formatting. Images might be included using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: Image URLs might be URL-encoded or include query parameters that aren't part of the actual file name.\n\n6. **Non-image File Extensions**: Links to non-image files or external resources could be mistakenly identified as images if the parser does not check for typical image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif).\n\n7. **Images within Text**: File names could appear as part of the text and not as actual image embeds, potentially causing false positives in the extraction process.\n\n8. **Comments**: Markdown does not officially support comments, but some flavors allow HTML comments which could contain commented-out image links.\n\n9. **Escaped Characters**: The parser needs to handle escaped characters properly to ensure they don't misinterpret parts of the text as image syntax.\n\n10. **Linked Images**: An image might also be a link, which adds another layer of syntax to parse correctly to extract just the image information.\n\nTo accurately extract all image file names, the parser would need to handle all these situations effectively."
