However, variations and errors in the syntax can occur, such as missing brackets or parentheses, which makes it hard to parse.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images**: Besides the inline style, Markdown also allows reference-style links, where the URL is not included inline but is referenced at another place in the document. Extracting images with reference-style links requires keeping track of the references.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown allows the embedding of HTML. Images can be embedded using HTML `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax. A parser must be able to handle these as well.\n\n4. **Link versus Image**: In Markdown, links and images are similar in their syntax, with the main difference being an exclamation mark before the brackets for images. It’s important not to confuse links with images.\n\n5. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: The image source might be a relative or absolute path, or a URL. The parser must correctly identify and extract these paths.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, the image syntax might include escape characters that should not be interpreted as markdown syntax.\n\n7. **Non-image URLs**: Sometimes URLs might point to resources that aren't images (e.g., `.html` pages, `.pdf` documents, etc.). The parser should distinguish between image files and other file types.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown Elements**: There may be nested Markdown elements within the alt text or title of the image. The parser needs to handle this without mistakenly interpreting it as separate Markdown elements.\n\n9. **File Name Extraction**: Once the URLs or paths have been identified, extracting just the file name might require additional logic, especially if the URL contains queries or fragments.\n\n10. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images can come in different formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.), and the parser should be able to recognize all these formats.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, let's proceed by looking at the input file to identify and extract the image filenames."
