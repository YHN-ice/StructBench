Variations in image syntax: Markdown can have variations in how images are embedded, including differences in spacing or the use of different quotation marks.\n2. Relative vs. absolute paths: Image paths can be relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs pointing to external resources.\n3. Inline HTML: Images might also be embedded using inline HTML tags within the Markdown file, which requires parsing HTML syntax.\n4. Reference-style images: Markdown also supports reference-style links, where the path is not included directly with the image syntax but elsewhere in the document.\n5. Text that looks like image syntax: There might be text within code blocks or inline code that resembles image syntax but isn't intended to be an image link.\n6. Multiple images on one line: There could be lines with more than one image, necessitating a routine that can handle multiple matches on a single line.\n\nTo accurately extract all image filenames, we need to ensure that the parser accounts for these variations and potential complexities."
