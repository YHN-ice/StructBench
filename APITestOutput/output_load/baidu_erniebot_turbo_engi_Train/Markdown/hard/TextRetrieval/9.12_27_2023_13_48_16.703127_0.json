The parser must be able to recognize all of these formats.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, strike-through, or links. The parser needs to correctly identify and extract the bold text without including unrelated formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Users might escape markdown syntax characters to prevent them from being parsed as formatting. The parser should not treat escaped asterisks or underscores as formatting (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`).\n\n4. **False Positives:** Asterisks and underscores might be used in the text for purposes other than formatting (e.g., in code blocks, for bullet lists, or within words). These should not be misinterpreted as bold formatting.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting:** If the markdown file contains incomplete bold syntax (e.g., missing one asterisk in `**incomplete*`), it could either be ignored or handled in a specific way based on the rules we set for the parser.\n\n6. **Line Breaks:** Bold text might span across multiple lines, which may complicate extraction, depending on how the parser processes line breaks.\n\n7. **Conflict with Other Elements:** Some markdown parsers give precedence to certain elements over others when there is a conflict in syntax (e.g., a link syntax taking precedence over bold syntax).\n\nTo extract the bold texts accurately, the parser will need to handle these potential difficulties by implementing a robust parsing algorithm or leveraging an existing markdown processing library that takes care of these edge cases."
