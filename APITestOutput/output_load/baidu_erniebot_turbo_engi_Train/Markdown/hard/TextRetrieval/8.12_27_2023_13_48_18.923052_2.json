It's essential to handle both styles.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be absolute URLs (http:// or https://) or relative paths (./images/pic.jpg). We need to ensure we can extract both correctly.\n\n3. **Alt Text Variation**: The alt text can include various characters, including brackets, which can complicate the parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n4. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes links and images can look similar in Markdown (images are just links with an exclamation mark in front), so it's important to distinguish between them.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown**: An image link might be nested within another Markdown element, like a list or a blockquote, which could affect the regex or parsing method used.\n\n6. **Broken Syntax**: Incomplete or broken image syntax could lead to false positives or negatives.\n\n7. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files include HTML tags for more complex formatting, which could include `<img>` tags for images.\n\n8. **Escape Characters**: Special Markdown characters might be escaped within the document, which could affect parsing if not accounted for.\n\n9. **Different File Formats**: Images could be in various formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser should be ready to recognize all possible image file extensions.\n\n10. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be lines with multiple images, and the parser should be able to extract all of them.\n\n11. **Non-Image Files**: Ensuring that only image files are extracted and non-image files (like .md or .txt) that might follow a similar pattern are excluded.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, careful construction of the parsing rules or regular expressions will be necessary to accurately identify and extract all the image files included in the Markdown file."
