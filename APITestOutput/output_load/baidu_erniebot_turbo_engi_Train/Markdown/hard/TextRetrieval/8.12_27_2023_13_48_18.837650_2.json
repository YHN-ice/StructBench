The standard format is `![Alt text](URL)` but there can be variations such as reference style links, HTML tags, or images included in links.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in Markdown can be linked using either relative or absolute paths. Determining the actual file name might be more challenging with relative paths that include directory traversal (e.g., `../images/pic.jpg`).\n\n3. **Image URLs**: Some images might be linked via URLs rather than file paths. Distinguishing between URLs and file paths is necessary to extract only the image file names.\n\n4. **Alternate Text and Titles**: Extracting only the file name requires ignoring the alternate text and the optional title that might be present in the image syntax.\n\n5. **Multiple Images on One Line**: Markdown allows for more than one image to be included on a single line, thus requiring a parser that can handle multiple matches within a line.\n\n6. **Link Definitions**: Images might use reference-style links where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document. The parser would need to locate these definitions to extract the correct file name.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown**: Images might be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown files use non-standard extensions or GitHub-flavored Markdown which have additional syntax for images that a standard Markdown parser might not recognize.\n\n9. **Escaped Characters**: If Markdown syntax characters are escaped (e.g., `\\!`), they should not be treated as part of the image syntax.\n\n10. **Corrupted Syntax**: There might be typos or errors in the Markdown syntax, leading to broken image links which could mislead the parsing process."
