We need to be prepared to handle both scenarios.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can contain other Markdown elements like links, italics, or inline code. We'll need to ensure that we extract the bold text without including markup from nested elements.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores can be used in non-bold contexts (like in bullet points or horizontal rules), so we need to differentiate between bold markup and other uses.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks and underscores can be escaped with a backslash (\\\\) to display them as literal characters rather than formatting, so we have to check for escapes to avoid false extractions.\n\n5. **Incomplete Delimiters**: We may encounter an opening bold delimiter without a corresponding closing delimiter, which could lead to incorrect parsing or ignoring the text that's meant to be bold.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, we need to ensure our parser can handle this scenario and still extract the complete text.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Markdown does not have a strict specification, and different implementations might handle edge cases differently, so there might be inconsistencies in how bold is represented or expected.\n\n8. **Inline HTML**: Markdown can also include inline HTML. If bold text is formatted using HTML tags like `<strong>`, we need to be able to recognize and process those as well.\n\n9. **Performance Issues**: Depending on the size and complexity of the Markdown file, performance could become an issue, especially for large files with many instances of bold text.\n\n10. **Encoding**: The file might use a character encoding that doesn't match our parser's expected encoding, potentially causing issues with character interpretation.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we would need to write robust parsing logic that carefully considers these factors and includes checks and balances for each scenario to accurately extract only the desired bold texts."
