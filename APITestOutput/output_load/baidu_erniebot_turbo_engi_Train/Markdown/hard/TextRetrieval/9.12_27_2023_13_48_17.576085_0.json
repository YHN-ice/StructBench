These nested elements might need to be ignored or processed differently.\n3. **False Positives**: Lines that contain double asterisks or underscores might not always indicate bold text, for example, they could be part of a code block or a bullet list item.\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, the bold markers might not be properly closed, leading to ambiguity about where the bold text actually ends.\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores may be escaped with backslashes in the Markdown text, which means they should not be counted as markers for bold text.\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown does not officially support multiline bold text, but some parsers might allow it, so it might appear in the file and need to be handled.\n\nThese are just a few potential issues that could make extracting bold texts from a Markdown file challenging.
