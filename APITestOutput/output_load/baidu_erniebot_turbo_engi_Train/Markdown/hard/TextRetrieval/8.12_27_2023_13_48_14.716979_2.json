Identifying both styles would be necessary.\n\n2. **Recognizing file names**: Image paths could be URLs or relative paths to files. It can be tricky to distinguish between a URL that points to an online resource and a filename.\n\n3. **Different file extensions**: Images can have various file extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. The parser needs to recognize all possible image extensions.\n\n4. **Alt text and titles**: Image syntax can include alt text and titles that might contain characters or patterns that resemble file names or paths, which could lead to confusion.\n\n5. **False positives**: Other lines might contain parentheses and brackets that aren't part of image syntax and should not be considered.\n\n6. **Nested content**: In some Markdown parsers, images can also be nested within other elements, which might complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Escape characters**: Some images might include escape characters that need to be handled correctly to extract the actual filename.\n\n8. **Linked images**: Sometimes images are linked, so the syntax has both a link and an image, which might add complexity to the parsing logic.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a robust solution would need to handle a variety of cases and edge conditions accurately to ensure only image file names are extracted."
