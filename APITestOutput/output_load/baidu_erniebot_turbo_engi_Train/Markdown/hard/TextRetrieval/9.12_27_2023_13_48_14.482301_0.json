The parser must recognize all of these patterns.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, strike-through, or inline code blocks. The parser must be able to discern bold text within these contexts without being confused by the surrounding syntax.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Markdown allows the escaping of special characters with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold**`). The parser must ignore escaped bold syntax so that it does not mistakenly extract non-bold text.\n\n4. **False positives within code blocks**: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented with four spaces) should not be processed for formatting. The parser must avoid extracting bold text from within code blocks.\n\n5. **False positives within URLs or HTML tags**: URLs or HTML tags might contain sequences of characters that resemble bold syntax but are not meant to be formatted (e.g., `http://example.com/path__to__file`). The parser must distinguish these cases.\n\n6. **Inconsistent formatting**: There might be incorrectly formatted bold text where the opening and closing syntax does not match or is incomplete (e.g., `**bold text`). The parser needs to decide whether to strictly enforce correct syntax or to allow some flexibility.\n\n7. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines. The parser must handle this case and extract the bold text in its entirety.\n\n8. **Overlapping or adjacent formatting**: There might be cases where bold formatting is adjacent to or overlaps with other formatting (e.g., `**bold****italic**`). The parser has to extract the bold text without including adjacent formatting elements.\n\nEach of these cases presents a unique challenge and the parser must be designed to navigate them accurately in order to correctly extract all instances of bold text from the Markdown file."
