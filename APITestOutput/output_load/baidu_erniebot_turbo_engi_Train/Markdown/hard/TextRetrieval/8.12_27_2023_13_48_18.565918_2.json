Example: `![alt text](image.jpg)`. We need to recognize this syntax to correctly extract image references.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images in a Markdown file can be linked using either relative paths or absolute URLs. The parser must handle both cases and only extract the file names or paths without the domain for absolute URLs.\n\n3. **Variations in File Extensions**: Image files can have various extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.). The parser needs to account for all possible image extensions.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style image linking, where the URL is not inline with the alt text but rather defined elsewhere in the document. The parser should be able to resolve these references as well.\n\n5. **Image Links with Parameters or Anchors**: Sometimes, image URLs might include query parameters or anchors (e.g., `image.png?size=100`, `image.png#section`). The parser needs to strip these off if only file names are required.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters or Markdown Extensions**: There could be escaped characters, or the file could use Markdown extensions that modify or enhance standard image syntax which could complicate parsing.\n\n7. **HTML Image Tags**: Since Markdown supports HTML, some images might be included using the `<img>` tag. A robust parser should also take this into account.\n\n8. **Textual Noise**: There might be non-image links or other textual elements that look similar to image syntax which should be ignored.\n\n9. **Multiple Images in a Single Line**: There could be multiple images on a single line of Markdown, so the parser will need to handle this without mistakenly combining file names.\n\nAfter identifying these potential challenges, we could proceed to parse the Markdown content and extract the image files accordingly once the input file is provided."
