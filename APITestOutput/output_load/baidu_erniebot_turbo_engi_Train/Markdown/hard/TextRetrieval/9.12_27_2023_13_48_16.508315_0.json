These cases need special handling if they are also bolded.\n\n9. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) or inline code (indicated by single backticks `) should typically not be parsed for additional formatting, including bold.\n\nThe parser must navigate these potential issues to accurately extract only the bold-text portions from the Markdown file."
