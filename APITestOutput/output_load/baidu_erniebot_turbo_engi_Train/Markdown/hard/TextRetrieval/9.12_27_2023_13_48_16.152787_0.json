I need to be able to recognize both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested elements**: Bold text may have other elements nested inside, such as links, italics, or code spans. It could be challenging to extract just the bold text while ignoring the nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: If asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash, they should not be treated as formatting markers. Detecting and handling escaped characters is necessary to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting**: Sometimes, the syntax for bold may not be properly closed, leading to incorrect parsing. For example, `**Bold text` without a closing `**`.\n\n5. **False positives**: Text that contains double asterisks or underscores but isn't meant to be bold could be misinterpreted. For example, in a mathematical context where asterisks represent multiplication.\n\n6. **Mixed formatting**: Bold text might be mixed with other formatting like strikethroughs or blockquotes, which could complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Ambiguous cases**: It could be challenging to determine if text is bold in ambiguous cases, such as when asterisks are used in a list or in proximity to other punctuation.\n\n8. **Line breaks**: Bold text that spans multiple lines can present issues since Markdown handles line breaks in different ways.\n\n9. **Contextual formatting**: The meaning of asterisks and underscores can change based on their context (like in lists or block quotes), which may affect their interpretation as bold markers.\n\n10. **Performance issues**: If the Markdown file is very large, efficiency becomes important to avoid long processing times.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll need to take these potential issues into account to accurately extract all the bold texts."
