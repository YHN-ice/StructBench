I have to ensure that my parser can recognize both methods.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text can be nested within other elements, such as within links `[**bold**](url)` or italicized text `*italic **bold** italic*. I need to be careful to extract only the bold part of the text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might use backslashes to escape Markdown syntax, for example, `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`, which should not be treated as bold text.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: There may be instances where the bold markers are not paired correctly, such as `**bold*` or `**bold`. These should not be interpreted as bold text.\n\n5. **Code Blocks**: Bold syntax within code blocks or inline code should not be treated as bold text since they are part of code and not meant for styling within the Markdown.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There might be other uses of asterisks or underscores that are not meant to indicate bold text, and I need to differentiate those from actual bold formatting.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and it's important to correctly parse and retain the formatting even when the bold text is not on a single line.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that could arise. Depending on the input file, there may be additional considerations to take into account."
