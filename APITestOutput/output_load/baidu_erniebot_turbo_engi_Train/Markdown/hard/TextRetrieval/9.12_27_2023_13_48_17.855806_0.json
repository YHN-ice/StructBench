It's important to account for all of these possibilities.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting, such as italics, code blocks, or strikethroughs. This could complicate extraction as we need to ensure we are only extracting the bold text without additional formatting symbols.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be used in a context that does not denote bold text (e.g., in a code block or to denote a list item). It's important to differentiate between actual bold formatting and other uses of these symbols.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markdown Syntax**: There might be instances where the Markdown syntax for bold is not correctly closed (e.g., missing an asterisk), which could lead to confusion in determining what text should be considered bold.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, the asterisks or underscores might be escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold**`), meaning they are not meant to format text as bold but rather to be displayed as literal characters.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, so the parser needs to handle line breaks appropriately within bold sections.\n\n7. **Links and Images**: Text within links and images might also use asterisks or underscores, so the parser will need to distinguish between these and actual bold markup.\n\nThese are just a few potential challenges that might be faced when parsing a Markdown file for bold texts.
