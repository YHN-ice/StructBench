A parser must be able to recognize and handle all variations.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold text might be within a paragraph or line of text, rather than on its own line. This requires the parser to distinguish bold text even when it's surrounded by other text.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could contain other formatting inside it, such as italic (`*italic*` or `_italic_`), code (`backticks`), or links (`[link text](url)`). Extracting just the bold text while ignoring nested elements could be challenging.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows users to escape formatting characters with a backslash (`\\`). For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be treated as bold text.\n\n5. **False Positives**: There might be asterisks or underscores in the text that are not meant for formatting purposes but are part of the content (such as mathematical expressions or when indicating a footnote).\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might have made errors in the Markdown formatting, like missing an asterisk or underscore, which could make it tricky to parse correctly.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (```) or inline code (``) should not be treated as formatted text since asterisks and underscores in code are meant to be taken literally rather than as formatting indicators.\n\n8. **Lists and Quotations**: Asterisks are also used for creating lists in Markdown, so the parser must differentiate between list items and bold text.\n\nEach obstacle will require careful consideration in the logic of the Markdown parser to ensure only the actual bold texts are extracted accurately."
