When parsing a Markdown file to extract image files, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Syntaxes for Images**: Markdown supports images using an exclamation mark followed by the square brackets for alt text and the parentheses for the image URL. However, there could be variations, such as reference-style image syntax or images included as HTML tags.\n\n2. **Complex URLs**: Images might be hosted on external websites with complex URLs that include query parameters or fragments. These need to be correctly identified and extracted in their entirety.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images might be linked using relative paths or absolute paths, and it's important to handle both cases accurately.\n\n4. **Encoded or Special Characters**: The image URLs may contain encoded characters or special characters which should be correctly interpreted.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images could be nested inside other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Link References**: Markdown allows for link references where the URL is not directly alongside the link text but is instead referenced at another place in the document. Identifying these instances may require parsing the entire document for reference links.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes image syntax might include escape characters that need to be handled properly to avoid misinterpretation as markup.\n\n8. **Non-image Links**: Ensuring that only image file links are extracted and not other types of links, such as links to web pages.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust Markdown parser needs to accurately interpret the Markdown syntax and extract image file names considering all the above possibilities and variations."
