It's important to recognize the difference.\n\n5. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: There are various flavors of Markdown, like GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), which may have additional syntax rules for embedding images.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, image syntax might be escaped to prevent it from rendering, such as `!\\[alt text\\](image_url)`. This should be treated as text, not an image.\n\n7. **Text that Looks Like Image Syntax**: There might be instances where regular text looks similar to image syntax but isn't meant to be an image link, like code snippets or examples of Markdown syntax within the document.\n\n8. **File Type Determination**: The parser needs to recognize different image file types (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) amidst other file types that might also be present in the document (e.g., .pdf, .zip).\n\n9. **Path Complexity**: File paths can include directories, subdirectories, and may even have URL parameters if they are web-based, which could complicate extraction.\n\n10. **Multiple Images on One Line**: Sometimes multiple images could be placed on a single line, and the parser must be able to extract all of them separately.\n\nTo handle these challenges, the parser needs to be robust enough to handle different variations and edge cases while accurately extracting the relevant information."
