The most common way is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there could be variations, such as reference-style links, or images embedded within HTML tags in the Markdown file.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Image paths can be relative to the Markdown document or absolute URLs. Extracting just the file names may require distinguishing between these two and possibly removing domain names or preceding path components from absolute URLs.\n\n3. **Alt Text Confusion:** Sometimes, the alt text of an image can contain brackets `[]` or parentheses `()`, which could be mistaken for the markers of a URL if the parser is not careful.\n\n4. **Non-image Files:** URLs within the Markdown could point to non-image files, so the parser needs to correctly identify and extract only image file links.\n\n5. **Link Clutter:** There might be non-image links that could clutter the search for actual image file links, and the parser needs to differentiate between them.\n\n6. **Nested Content:** Sometimes images may be nested within other elements, like a list or a blockquote, which might complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. **Escape Characters:** In Markdown, escape characters like backslashes are used to render literal characters that would otherwise serve as Markdown syntax. The parser must handle these correctly.\n\n8. **Formatting Consistency:** There might be inconsistencies in how the Markdown is written, such as spacing issues or missing elements, which could make parsing more difficult.\n\n9. **Image Hosts and Services:** Some images might be hosted on services that use dynamic URLs or embedding methods that do not end in typical image file extensions (like `.jpg`, `.png`), making it hard to identify them as images.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll have to consider these potential difficulties when extracting the image file names."
