For example, images can be embedded using the `![Alt text](URL)` format or with reference-style links. Handling both inline and reference images requires different parsing strategies.\n\n2. **Complex URLs**: Image file paths or URLs can include complex patterns, special characters, query strings, or anchors which might complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Encoded URLs**: URLs within the Markdown could be URL-encoded, which means characters may be represented using percent encoding (e.g., spaces as `%20`). Recognizing and decoding such URLs might be necessary.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image sources could be relative paths or absolute URLs. Distinguishing between a URL and a file path is important if the task requires it.\n\n5. **Image Tags Inside HTML Blocks**: If the Markdown contains raw HTML, image tags (`<img src=\"...\">`) may be used instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Alt Text Confusion**: In some cases, the alt text of an image might include parentheses or brackets which could be confused with the syntax for the image link itself.\n\n7. **Link Reference Definitions**: For reference-style images, the actual URL is defined elsewhere in the document. This means that multiple steps are required: identifying the reference and then finding its corresponding URL.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Non-image links or syntax that resembles image links but isn't (e.g., links to web pages that include an image extension in the URL) could lead to false positives.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown Elements**: An image link could be nested within another Markdown element like a list, blockquote, or a table, which might require more complex parsing logic.\n\n10. **File Extensions**: Images could have a variety of file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and some Markdown files may include images without an extension, which complicates identification.\n\nTo accurately extract image file names from a Markdown file, a parser must be equipped to handle these variabilities and more."
