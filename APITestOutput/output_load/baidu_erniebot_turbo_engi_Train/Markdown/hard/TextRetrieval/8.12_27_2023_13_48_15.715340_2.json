However, variations and extensions exist, such as different ways to include titles, reference-style images, or even HTML image tags embedded within the Markdown file.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute URLs**: The image source might be a relative URL (e.g., `images/picture.jpg`) or an absolute URL (e.g., `https://example.com/picture.jpg`). When extracting file names, you should decide whether to capture the full URL or just the file name.\n\n3. **Alt Text Complexity**: The alt text for an image could contain brackets, parentheses, or other characters that might complicate the regular expression or parsing logic.\n\n4. **Nested Content**: Sometimes, images may be included within other elements like links, which can change the syntax and make it more challenging to parse.\n\n5. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors allow for non-standard ways to include images, such as shorthand syntax or extended properties.\n\n6. **Potential Comments or Disabled Images**: Parts of the Markdown might be commented out using HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) or other methods that could contain image syntax but are not meant to display images.\n\n7. **File Formats and Extensions**: Images could have a variety of file extensions (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser will need to recognize all possible valid image file formats.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Image syntax could contain escaped characters that need to be properly handled during parsing.\n\nIdentifying and overcoming these challenges is crucial to create a robust parser that can accurately extract all image file names from a Markdown document."
