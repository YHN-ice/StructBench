The parser must be able to handle these nested elements without confusing the outer bold formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape the bold syntax characters (e.g., by using \\**) to display them as literal asterisks rather than formatting. The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Random pairs of asterisks or underscores within a text that are not meant for formatting might be mistaken as bold markers if not correctly parsed.\n\n5. **Incomplete Markers**: There might be instances where the closing markers for bold text are missing or where there are uneven numbers of asterisks or underscores, which the parser needs to handle gracefully.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: If the text is broken up across multiple lines, the parser needs to correctly identify if the bold formatting continues across lines or if it is interrupted.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can apply these considerations to extract all bold texts accurately."
