Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. **Different Syntax for Bold**: Markdown has multiple ways to denote bold text, such as `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`. The parser needs to recognize all possible syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might be nested within other elements like lists, blockquotes, or even within links. The parser must handle nested structures correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the asterisks or underscores used for bold text may be escaped (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), meaning they're not intended to make the text bold. The parser should correctly distinguish between escaped and unescaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: There could be cases where the bold syntax is started but not properly ended (e.g., `**bold`). The parser needs a strategy for handling these situations.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold formatting may span across multiple lines, and the parser will need to maintain the structure accordingly while extracting the bold parts.\n\n6. **Inline Code Blocks**: If the bold syntax appears within inline code blocks (denoted by backticks `), it should not be interpreted as bold since text within code blocks should be taken literally.\n\n7. **Complex Markdown Structures**: Markdown files can have complex structures with various elements like headers, lists, and code blocks mixed together. The parser must be able to navigate through these structures while focusing on extracting bold text.\n\nTo properly extract all the bold text while accounting for these issues, the parser will need to have robust logic that can understand and interpret the Markdown syntax accurately. Now let's proceed to see the input file so that I can extract the required information."
