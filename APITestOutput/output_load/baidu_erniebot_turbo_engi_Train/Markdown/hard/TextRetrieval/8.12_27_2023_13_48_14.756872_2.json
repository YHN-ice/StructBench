Therefore, the parser must correctly distinguish between images and hyperlinks to avoid extracting URLs of links instead of image file paths.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image sources may be given using relative or absolute paths, and sometimes they may point to external URLs rather than actual files within the repository or local file system.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also supports reference-style images, where the image reference is defined elsewhere in the document. These could be harder to identify because the actual file name is not located right next to the image syntax.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax. These can be harder to parse as they require parsing HTML within a Markdown file.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There might be non-image related text that accidentally matches the patterns used to find images (e.g., code blocks that include example Markdown syntax, or commented-out sections).\n\n7. **Text in Alt Tags**: The alt text for images might include parentheses or brackets which could confuse a simple regex parser looking for image file names.\n\nTo deal with these obstacles, a robust Markdown parser must incorporate logic to handle these edge cases and ambiguities while extracting image paths. This may involve complex regex patterns, dedicated Markdown parsing libraries, or manually inspecting the syntax structure of the Markdown file."
