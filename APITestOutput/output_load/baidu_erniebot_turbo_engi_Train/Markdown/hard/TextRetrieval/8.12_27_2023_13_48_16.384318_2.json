The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but it could also vary slightly, which could affect the parsing.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images might be linked with relative paths (e.g., `./images/picture.jpg`) or absolute URLs (e.g., `https://example.com/image.png`), and the parser needs to handle both cases appropriately.\n\n3. **Image References**: Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document. For example:\n\n    ```markdown\n    ![Alt text][id]\n\n    [id]: URL \"Optional title\"\n    ```\n\n4. **HTML Tags**: Sometimes images are embedded using raw HTML tags (like `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"description\" />`) within the Markdown file.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Image syntax might contain escaped characters which should not be confused with Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Non-image Links**: The parser should distinguish between image links and other types of links (e.g., hyperlinks to web pages) to avoid false positives.\n\n7. **Nested Content**: Images might be nested within other elements, like lists or blockquotes, and the parser should be able to extract these as well.\n\n8. **Invalid Markdown Syntax**: There might be incorrectly formatted Markdown that seems like an image link but isn't valid, and the parser should ideally recognize and skip these.\n\n9. **File Extensions**: The parser should recognize various image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.) but not confuse them with non-image file types.\n\nThese are some of the potential issues we might need to handle when extracting image files from a Markdown document. Now, please provide the input file so that I can proceed with extracting the image filenames."
