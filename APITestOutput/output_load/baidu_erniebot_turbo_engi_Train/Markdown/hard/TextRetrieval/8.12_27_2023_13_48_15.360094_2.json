I would need to differentiate between URLs and local file names.\n\n3. **Relative vs. absolute paths:** Some images might use relative paths while others might use absolute paths.\n\n4. **Different file extensions:** Images can have different extensions, such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., and I must be ready to handle all possible valid image formats.\n\n5. **Links that are not images:** Not all links in a Markdown file point to images. I need to ensure that I'm only extracting links that are intended to be images.\n\n6. **Image titles and alt text with parentheses or brackets:** Sometimes image alt texts or titles could include brackets or parentheses, which could complicate parsing if we naively split the text based on these characters.\n\n7. **Escaped characters:** The Markdown file might include escaped characters which need to be correctly interpreted.\n\nThese obstacles will require careful parsing of the Markdown content to ensure only image filenames are extracted accurately.
