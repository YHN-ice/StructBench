Each format has its syntax, and we would need to handle each one correctly.\n\n2. **Link Variations**: Some links might not end with typical image extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., because they could be dynamically served by web services or contain additional parameters after the file extension.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Image links might contain escape characters that we have to account for, such as spaces encoded as `%20` or other URL-encoded characters.\n\n4. **Non-Image URLs**: URLs that appear to be image links but are not (e.g., they might point to a web page or a script that generates an image).\n\n5. **Nested Content**: An image link might be nested within other content, like a table or a list, which might complicate the parsing.\n\n6. **Distinguishing from Hyperlinks**: Ensuring we extract image links and not regular hyperlinks, as they can look similar in Markdown syntax.\n\n7. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be included using relative paths that don't work outside of the context of the Markdown file's location.\n\n8. **Missing Image Files**: Some Markdown documents might reference images that don't exist or are not accessible, leading to broken links when trying to validate the existence of these files.\n\n9. **Markdown Extensions**: Depending on the Markdown parser or flavor being used (e.g., GitHub Flavored Markdown), there might be additional syntaxes for including images that need to be considered.\n\n10. **Textual Distractions**: It's possible for non-image text to be formatted in a way that resembles Markdown image syntax but isn't meant to be an image link.\n\nBecause I am acting as a Markdown file parser, I will need to have a way to identify and correctly interpret the syntax for images and differentiate it from other types of content in the Markdown file."
