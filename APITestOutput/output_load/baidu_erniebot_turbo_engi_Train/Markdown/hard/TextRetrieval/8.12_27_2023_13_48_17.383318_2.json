URLs could also include query parameters or anchors.\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be included using relative paths that wouldn't necessarily end in typical image extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, etc., if they are relying on server-side routing or rewrite rules.\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style linking, where the actual URL is placed elsewhere in the document with a reference identifier linking them.\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images may be embedded directly using Base64 encoding rather than linking to a file.\n6. **Textual Noise**: Image links could be surrounded by other text or characters that need to be properly ignored to extract just the filename.\n7. **File Name Extraction**: Once a URL is found, the challenge is to extract the file name correctly, which may include parsing out the domain name, path, and any URL parameters.\n8. **False Positives**: Some Markdown links might look like images due to a similar syntax but are actually links to non-image files or web pages.\n\nTo handle these potential obstacles, the parser needs to robustly identify the correct syntax for images and discern actual image files from other types of linked resources. It must also correctly handle various URL structures and extract precise file names from them."
