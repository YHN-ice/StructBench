The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations exist, especially with reference-style links.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. Extracting the file names might involve differentiating between URLs pointing to external resources and paths pointing to local image files.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Images come in various formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.) and ensuring that the parser identifies all types correctly is important.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files use raw HTML for more complex image embedding, which means the parser must also be able to handle HTML `<img>` tags.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: If an image syntax includes escaped characters (like `\\` before `!` in `!\\[Alt text\\](URL)`), the parser must recognize and handle these appropriately.\n\n6. **Link References**: Markdown allows for defining images with a two-part syntax where the URL part is separated and could be placed anywhere in the document. The parser needs to connect these references correctly to extract the image file name.\n\n7. **Markdown Flavors**: There are different Markdown flavors (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and each might have slight variations in how images are embedded, which could affect parsing.\n\n8. **Textual Noise**: There might be non-image-related content such as code blocks or inline code that contains similar patterns to the image syntax, which should not be mistaken for actual image links.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, effective parsing would require careful consideration of the Markdown syntax and any variations that may exist within the input file."
