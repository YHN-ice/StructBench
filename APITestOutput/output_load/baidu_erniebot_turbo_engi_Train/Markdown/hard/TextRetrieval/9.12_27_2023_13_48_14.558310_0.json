I need to be able to recognize both forms.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italics, links, or strikethroughs. For example, `**bold _and italic_**`. Extracting the bold part without the other formatting could be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Users might escape formatting characters to display them as plain text, like `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`. I need to ensure not to interpret these as bold.\n\n4. **Incorrect formatting**: There could be instances where the Markdown syntax is not correctly used, such as missing one asterisk in `**bold*` or space between asterisks and text `** not bold **`. These should not be considered as bold.\n\n5. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (indented with four spaces or enclosed in triple backticks ```) or inline code (enclosed in single backticks `) should not be formatted, so any bold syntax within them should be ignored.\n\n6. **Links containing bold text**: Markdown link syntax may contain bold text within the link text `[**bold**](url)`. The parser needs to handle such cases correctly and only extract the bold parts.\n\n7. **Handling of multiline bold text**: If bold text spans multiple lines (which is less common), the parser needs to handle it correctly.\n\nThese are just a few potential issues that could arise while extracting bold texts from a Markdown document. The parser must be prepared to handle these cases to provide accurate extractions."
