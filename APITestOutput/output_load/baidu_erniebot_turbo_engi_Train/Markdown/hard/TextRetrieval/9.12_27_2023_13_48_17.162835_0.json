We need to ensure that the parser can handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might include other formatting like italics, strikethrough, or code spans. The parser should be able to handle nested formatting correctly and only extract the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be escaped with backslashes to display them as literal characters instead of formatting. The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting Markers**: There might be instances where the Markdown file has errors, such as unmatched or incomplete formatting markers. The parser should either ignore these or handle them gracefully.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks or inline code should not be treated as formatted text. The parser must distinguish between regular text and code.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Links or images might have bold text within their descriptions or alt text, which should also be handled correctly.\n\n7. **Line Breaks and Paragraphs**: Markdown interpreters sometimes have different ways of handling line breaks and paragraphs, which might affect how bold text is identified and extracted.\n\n8. **Extended Markdown Features**: Different flavors of Markdown may have extended features that influence parsing, such as GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) with additional syntax rules.\n\nAfter considering these potential challenges, let's proceed to see the input file so we can attempt to extract the bold texts accurately."
