Here are potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise while trying to extract all bold texts from a Markdown file:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Syntax**: Markdown has multiple ways to denote bold text, commonly `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`. Ensuring the parser recognizes all possible syntaxes is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may have nested formatting such as italic, strikethrough, or even inline code. It will be challenging to extract only the bold text while ignoring the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes bold syntax characters might be escaped to show them as literal characters (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they shouldn't be treated as formatting.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There may be cases where asterisks or underscores are used in the text not for formatting purposes but as part of a regular text (e.g., mathematical expressions or within code blocks).\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting**: A user might have accidentally left incomplete formatting which could lead to confusion, such as a single asterisk or underscore without a closing pair.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Bold syntax within code blocks and inline code should not be treated as bold formatting since they are meant to display raw code.\n\n7. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is particularly large, performance could become an issue, and an efficient parsing algorithm would be necessary.\n\n8. **Links and Images**: The parser needs to be careful with link texts or alt texts of images that use bold formatting so as not to include markdown link/image syntax in the extracted text.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I can demonstrate how to address some of these challenges. However, without actively parsing and without an updateable database of knowledge or state, I will only be able to provide conceptual guidance rather than an executable parsing process."
