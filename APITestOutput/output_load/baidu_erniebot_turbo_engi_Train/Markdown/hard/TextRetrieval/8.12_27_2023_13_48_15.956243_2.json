The most common is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but there could be variations, or even HTML-style image tags.\n\n2. **Links vs Images**: In Markdown, links and images are very similar. A link is `[Link text](URL \"Title\")`, while an image is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`. It's important not to confuse the two.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown supports reference-style links and images, which could look something like this:\n   ```\n   ![Alt text][id]\n   [id]: URL \"Title\"\n   ```\n   These can be harder to parse because the URL does not immediately follow the alt text.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images in a Markdown file can have relative paths (like `./image.png`) or absolute paths (like `https://example.com/image.png`). The parser must handle both types.\n\n5. **Embedded Images in HTML**: Sometimes, Markdown files contain raw HTML, including `<img>` tags. The parser must recognize these as well.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: There might be escaped characters that are part of the Markdown syntax which need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n7. **Nested Content**: An image link may be nested within other elements, such as a list or a blockquote, which could make parsing more complex.\n\n8. **Image Titles with Special Characters**: If an image title contains characters such as \")\", the parser must ensure it parses up to the correct closing parenthesis for the image URL/title.\n\n9. **Incorrectly Formatted Images**: There could be incorrectly formatted image markdown that is intended to be an image but doesn't conform to the standard formatting rules.\n\n10. **File Extension Recognition**: The parser should correctly identify common image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif) but also be aware of less common ones or situation where the extension might not be present in the URL.\n\nThese are just a few of the potential challenges in parsing Markdown to extract image files. Once we see the input file, we'll need to consider these and possibly other issues that might arise."
