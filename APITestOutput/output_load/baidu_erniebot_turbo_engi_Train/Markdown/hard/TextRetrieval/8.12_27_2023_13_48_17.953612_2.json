Some potential difficulties and obstacles that might occur during this process could include:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: There might be variations in the syntax, such as omitting the optional title, alt text, or having additional spaces that could make pattern matching tricky.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image references could be to local files (relative paths) or hosted images (absolute URLs). The parser needs to differentiate and decide which to consider as included image files.\n\n3. **Link References**: Markdown allows for link references where the URL part of the image is not directly in the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, image syntax may be escaped to prevent it from being rendered as an image (e.g., `!\\[Alt text\\]\\(URL \"Optional title\"\\)`), and the parser must recognize and ignore these instances.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain HTML tags. Images might be embedded using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax, which would require a different parsing approach.\n\n6. **Non-Standard Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors (like GitHub Flavored Markdown) may have additional syntax extensions for images that need to be accounted for.\n\n7. **Textual Noise**: There might be lines that closely resemble image syntax but are not valid image references, such as commented-out lines or examples used within documentation.\n\n8. **File Name Convention**: File names can have different conventions, such as spaces replaced with `%20`, special characters, or case sensitivity issues that can complicate extraction.\n\nGiven these potential issues, a robust parser must account for these variations and still correctly identify and extract the image file names from the Markdown content."
