The most common are double asterisks `**bold**` and double underscores `__bold__`. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text in Markdown can include other formatting like italics, links, or even inline code. The parser should be able to correctly handle and ignore the nested elements while extracting the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape the Markdown syntax characters by using a backslash `\\` before the character, like `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be treated as bold.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, users may make typos or mistakes like `**bold*` or `**bold**text without space`, which could confuse the parser.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Sequences of asterisks or underscores that are not meant to signify bold text could be misinterpreted by the parser, such as in a mathematical context or when indicating a break in the document with `***` or `___`.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Markdown allows for line breaks inside bold syntax, so the parser should be able to handle multiline bold text.\n\n7. **Ambiguity with Headers**: In some Markdown variants, lines beginning with double asterisks might be confused with headers if not properly parsed.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is very large, the parser needs to be efficient to provide answers in a reasonable time frame.\n\nThese are just some of the challenges that might need to be addressed when parsing Markdown files for bold text."
