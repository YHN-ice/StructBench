Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Identifying Image Syntax:** The standard Markdown syntax for images is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. We need to correctly identify this pattern, which can vary if there's additional syntax for styling or if it's nested within other elements.\n\n2. **Variations in Syntax:** There might be variations or extensions to the standard Markdown syntax such as reference-style images, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Images can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. The parser must be able to handle both cases to accurately extract the file names.\n\n4. **Presence of Additional Attributes:** In some Markdown flavors, images might include additional attributes like width, height, classes, etc., which could be inside the link or as part of extended syntax.\n\n5. **Encoding and Special Characters:** File names could include spaces, special characters, or URL encoding that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n6. **Inline HTML:** Some Markdown files might include images using inline HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax. This would require the parser to also be able to handle HTML parsing.\n\n7. **False Positives:** Text that coincidentally looks like Markdown image syntax but isn't an actual image link (such as examples or documentation about Markdown syntax) should not be extracted mistakenly.\n\n8. **Linked Images vs. Embedded Images:** Some Markdown files contain links that lead to images but aren't displayed as images within the document itself. These should not be confused with embedded images.\n\nIt's important for the parser to be robust against these potential issues and to correctly identify and extract only those lines that correspond to actual image files included in the document."
