Only the filenames from relative URLs can be directly extracted, while absolute URLs would require additional parsing to extract the filename.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Images in Markdown can also be referenced using a separate reference section. We would need to locate these references to extract the correct filenames.\n\n4. **Markdown Links vs. Image Links**: We need to differentiate between Markdown links (which link to URLs) and image links (which display images).\n\n5. **Escaped Characters or Markdown within Code Blocks**: Escaped characters or image syntax within code blocks should not be mistaken for actual images.\n\n6. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include HTML for more complex formatting, including images. This could complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Multiple Images in a Single Line**: A single line may contain multiple images, each of which needs to be extracted.\n\n8. **Images Without Alt Text**: Some images might not have alt text, so we'll need to ensure that the parser can handle this scenario.\n\n9. **Handling Different File Extensions**: Image filenames could have various extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., and the parser should recognize all possible image file types.\n\nOnce we encounter the input Markdown file, we'll apply rules according to its content, keeping in mind these potential obstacles."
