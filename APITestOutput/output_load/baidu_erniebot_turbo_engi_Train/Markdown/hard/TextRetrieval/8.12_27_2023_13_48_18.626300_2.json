Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Variety in Syntax**: Markdown supports multiple ways to embed images, such as `![Alt text](URL)` or HTML tags like `<img src=\"URL\" alt=\"Alt text\">`. We must account for all possible syntaxes.\n\n2. **Links vs. Images**: It could be challenging to distinguish between Markdown links and images since they have similar syntax. For example, `[Link text](URL)` is a link, while `![Alt text](URL)` is an image.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The image sources might be given as relative paths or absolute URLs. We'll need to capture both types.\n\n4. **Image References**: Markdown also allows for reference-style image insertion, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document. For example:\n   ```\n   ![Alt text][id]\n   \n   [id]: URL \"Optional Title\"\n   ```\n   \n5. **Nested Content**: Images might be included within other elements, such as lists or blockquotes, which may complicate extraction.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, the image syntax might include escaped characters that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n7. **Invalid or Broken Syntax**: The Markdown file might contain mistakes or nonstandard uses of the Markdown syntax that could lead to incorrect extraction of image file names.\n\n8. **Non-image Files**: There might be links to non-image files that we need to ignore.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the correct approach to parse the Markdown file for images involves accounting for various syntaxes and filtering out non-image elements. Once we see the input file, we'll apply the necessary logic to extract only the image file names."
