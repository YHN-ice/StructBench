The parser must be able to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold text might have other elements nested within it, such as links (`[link](url)`), images, or even other bold or italic markers. The parser will need to correctly extract the bold text without including the syntax of the nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Bold markers might be escaped in the Markdown, which means they are not meant to represent bold text. For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n4. **False Positives:** There can be false positives where asterisks or underscores are used for other purposes, like listing items or denoting a separator line (`_______`), which could be confused with bold text.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text:** Markdown can sometimes support bold text that spans across multiple lines, which requires the parser to handle multiline patterns.\n\n6. **Partial Formatting:** There might be cases where the bold syntax is not correctly closed, leading to partial formatting that might confuse the parser.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ` ``` ` or indented with 4 spaces) and inline code (encased in single backticks ` `code` `) should not be considered for formatting, including bold.\n\n8. **Performance Considerations:** If the Markdown document is very large, the parser's performance might become an issue, and efficient parsing algorithms would be necessary.\n\nTo successfully extract bold texts, the Markdown parser must be designed to handle these cases effectively.
