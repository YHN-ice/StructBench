The most common is `![alt text](url)`, but variations might include additional attributes, such as title tags `![alt text](url \"title\")`.\n\n2. **Inline vs Reference Style Links:**\n   Images can be linked inline, with the URL directly in the tag, or through reference-style links where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths:**\n   Images can be included using both relative and absolute paths, and distinguishing which filenames are actually part of the document could be tricky.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs and Special Characters:**\n   Some image URLs might be URL-encoded or include special characters that need to be decoded or handled properly.\n\n5. **Non-Image File Extensions:**\n   URLs in an image tag might not always point to image files; they could link to any type of file, so we need to discern which ones are actually images based on file extensions or other indicators.\n\n6. **HTML Tags:**\n   Markdown can also include raw HTML, so it's possible that some images could be included with `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n7. **Distraction with Non-image Links:**\n   Markdown syntax for links is similar to that for images, except that it doesn't start with an exclamation mark. Care must be taken not to confuse image syntax with link syntax.\n\n8. **Comments and Disabled Image Links:**\n   Some images might be commented out or their syntax could be intentionally disabled by escaping characters.\n\n9. **Complex Document Structure:**\n   If the Markdown document includes a lot of nested structures, like lists within blockquotes, it could make parsing for images more complex.\n\nEach of these potential issues needs to be accounted for in the parser logic to ensure that all and only image files are accurately extracted."
