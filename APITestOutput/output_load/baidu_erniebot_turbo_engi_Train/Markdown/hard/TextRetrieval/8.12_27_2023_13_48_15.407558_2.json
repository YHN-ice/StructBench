The basic syntax is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there might be variations or additional elements like title attributes, reference-style links, or inline HTML.\n\n2. **Image links vs. display images**: Not all URLs or paths within a Markdown file necessarily link to an image for display purposes; some might be hyperlinks that happen to point to image files. Distinguishing between an image meant for viewing in the document and a link to an image file will be necessary.\n\n3. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Image sources can be absolute URLs (pointing to an external resource), or relative paths (pointing to a file within the same repository or file system). Handling both types correctly may be required.\n\n4. **Alternate text and titles**: Extracting the filename may need to distinguish between the actual path of the image and the alternate text or title, which could also contain similar or confusing syntax.\n\n5. **Variations in file extension**: Images can have different file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.), and markdown could link to any of those. The parser should handle all common image file types.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown**: Sometimes images are nested within other elements, like lists or blockquotes. The parser must navigate such structures.\n\n7. **Escaping characters**: In Markdown, certain characters can be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as Markdown syntax. The parser must recognize if an image syntax is escaped and thus should not be treated as an actual image.\n\n8. **Invalid or broken links**: Links to images might be incorrectly formatted, broken, or invalid, and the parser should decide whether to report these as well.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will help in correctly identifying and extracting the names of the image files included in the Markdown content provided."
