The parser must recognize both forms.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might contain other formatting within it, such as italics, links, or inline code. Properly extracting the bold text without the inner formatting could be a challenge.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Asterisks or underscores could be escaped with backslashes (\\) in the Markdown, which means they are not meant to format the text but to be displayed as literal characters.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Text:** If bold text spans multiple lines, the parser needs to correctly identify and extract the full content across those lines.\n\n5. **False Positives:** There might be patterns that resemble bold syntax but aren't intended to be bold, such as asterisks used in lists or underscores in filenames and URLs.\n\n6. **Mixed Formatting on a Single Line:** A single line might have multiple formats, with some texts in bold and others not, so the parser must selectively extract only the bold parts.\n\nTo correctly extract the bold text, the parser must be able to handle all these cases accurately."
