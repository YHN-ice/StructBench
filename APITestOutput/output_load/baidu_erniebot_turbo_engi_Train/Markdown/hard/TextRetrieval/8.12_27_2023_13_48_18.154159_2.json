The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`. However, there might be variations or shortcut references that could be used.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using HTML tags such as `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"Title\"/>`. This would require parsing HTML within the Markdown file.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline but referenced at another place in the document. For example:\n   ```\n   ![Alt text][id]\n   ...\n   [id]: URL \"Title\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image sources can be either relative to the file location or absolute URLs. Both need to be handled, but the output requirement for file names may differ.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: Some image URLs might be URL-encoded and would need decoding to extract the actual file name.\n\n6. **Linked Images**: Sometimes images are linked so that when you click on them, they take you to another webpage. The syntax looks similar to a regular image syntax but with an extra set of brackets around it.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: There could be escape characters that are part of Markdown syntax to consider, such as `\\!` which should not be confused with actual images.\n\n8. **Non-image File Links**: The parser must differentiate between images and other types of file links (like `.pdf`, `.docx`) that could also appear in the same format.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will help us parse Markdown more accurately for image files. Now, I'm ready to see the input file and begin parsing it to extract the included image files."
