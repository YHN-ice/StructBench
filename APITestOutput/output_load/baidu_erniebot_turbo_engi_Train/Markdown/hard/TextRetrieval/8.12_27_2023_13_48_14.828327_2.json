We need to account for all of these possibilities.\n   \n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: The image path can be a relative path or an absolute URL. Absolute URLs might include domain names which need to be parsed correctly to extract just the file name.\n\n3. **File extensions**: While there are common file extensions for images, we need to consider any valid image file extension that might appear in the document.\n\n4. **Special characters**: File names may include special characters which need to be handled properly during extraction.\n\n5. **Title and alt attributes**: Images in Markdown can also include optional alt text and title attributes which should not be mistaken as part of the file name.\n\n6. **Variations in formatting**: Markdown does not have a strict syntax definition and different implementations may have slight variations which may affect how the images are included.\n\n7. **Non-image file URLs**: Not every URL inside parenthesis may correspond to an image file. We need to discern between image files and other types of links.\n\n8. **Reference-style definitions**: If the reference style is used, we need to match the reference with its actual URL, which might not be on the same line.\n\n9. **Escaped characters**: In some cases, characters in a Markdown file may be escaped with backslashes, which might affect the parsing of image URLs.\n\n10. **Nested Markdown elements**: The image tag could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, requiring more complex parsing rules.\n\nOnce we have the input Markdown file, we'll need to carefully address these challenges in order to accurately extract all included image files."
