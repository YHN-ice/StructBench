Different Markdown Syntaxes: Markdown supports different ways to denote bold text, typically either using double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. We need to ensure our parser can handle both cases.\n\n2. Nested Markdown Elements: Bold text might have nested Markdown elements such as italic, strikethrough, or even inline code. We need to decide whether to strip these nested elements or include them as part of the bold text.\n\n3. Escaped Characters: Sometimes asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to display them literally rather than as formatting, like so: `\\**not bold\\**`. We need to make sure our parser does not falsely identify these as bold text.\n\n4. Incomplete Formatting: There could be instances where the bold formatting is not correctly closed, such as `**bold`. We must decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. Contextual Formatting: Text that is part of a code block or inline code should not be interpreted as bold, even if it contains the bold syntax markers.\n\n6. Multiple Bold Sections in a Single Line: There may be multiple bold sections within a single line, and we need to extract each of them separately.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser would need to be robust enough to accurately identify and extract only the intended bold texts from the Markdown file."
