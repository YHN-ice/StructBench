The most common Markdown syntax to include an image looks like this: `![alt text](image_path)`. Here are some potential difficulties that might arise when trying to extract image file names:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: Markdown can sometimes have variations in the image syntax, for example, extra spaces or different alt text descriptions. It's important to account for these variations to ensure all image links are captured.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The path to the image file might be provided as a relative path or an absolute URL. Handling both cases might be necessary.\n\n3. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There could be lines with multiple images included on them. The parser needs to be able to extract multiple image paths from a single line.\n\n4. **Link References**: Markdown allows the use of reference-style links, where the actual URL is provided elsewhere in the document. This requires cross-referencing with the defined URL to get the image path.\n\n5. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions that allow for additional syntax, such as setting image size or alignment. These could complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, images might be included using raw HTML tags within the Markdown file, requiring a different parsing approach than standard Markdown syntax.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Image syntax might contain escape characters that need to be handled correctly during the extraction.\n\n8. **Non-image Links**: Ensuring that only image files are extracted and not other types of file links or non-image URLs.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help in creating a robust parser that can accurately extract all included image files from the given Markdown input."
