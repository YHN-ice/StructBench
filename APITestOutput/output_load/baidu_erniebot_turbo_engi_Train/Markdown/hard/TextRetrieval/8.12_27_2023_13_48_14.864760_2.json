The parser must extract the filename correctly regardless of the path's complexity.\n3. **Reference-style Links:** Reference-style image links separate the image link from the actual URL, so the parser must recognize and handle both parts.\n4. **Multiple Images on One Line:** Sometimes multiple images might be included on one line. The parser should be able to handle this without mistakenly merging filenames.\n5. **Markdown Variants:** There might be slight variations in how different Markdown processors handle image embedding, which could affect parsing.\n6. **Image Links Inside Other Elements:** Images might be included inside other elements like a list or a table, which can affect how the text is parsed.\n7. **Escaped Characters or Incorrect Syntax:** There might be escaped characters that prevent an image link from being recognized or incorrect syntax that the parser should ideally ignore.\n8. **Alt Text Complexity:** The alt text for an image might include characters like brackets or parentheses, which could complicate parsing if not handled properly.\n\nOnce we identify an image link, we'll need to extract just the filename and list them separated by a newline character (`\\n`). To do this, we'll likely use regular expressions or some form of string analysis to match and extract the relevant substrings from the Markdown content."
