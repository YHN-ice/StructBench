Markdown image syntax typically looks something like this:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)\n![Alt text](path/to/image.png \"Optional title\")\n```\n\nThe main challenges and obstacles that might arise when attempting to extract these image file names could include:\n\n1. **Variations in Markdown image syntax:** Markdown can include images using slightly different syntax variations. I need to account for these differences, such as optional alt text, optional title text after the URL, and different ways to delimit the URL (parentheses or angle brackets).\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths:** Image paths in Markdown files could be relative to the file's location or absolute URLs. The parser should identify both types of paths and extract only the file names if that's what is required.\n\n3. **Reference-style images:** Markdown also allows for reference-style links and images, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document. Identifying these might be more complex.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML image tags:** Some Markdown files might embed HTML directly, including `<img>` tags. While this is not standard Markdown syntax, it's commonly used and should be considered.\n\n5. **False positives:** The parser might encounter false positives where a line of text looks like an image syntax but isn't one—for example, a line inside a code block or part of a table that shouldn't be processed.\n\n6. **Special characters and encoding:** Image paths can contain spaces, special characters, or Unicode characters, which could affect the extraction process if not handled correctly.\n\n7. **Link definitions with no images:** There may be link definitions present that look similar to images but do not display an image (e.g., they are standard links rather than image links).\n\n8. **Multiline syntax:** In some rare cases, the Markdown image syntax might be split across multiple lines.\n\n9. **Escaped characters:** Image syntax with escaped characters (like `!\\[Alt text\\](path/to/image.jpg)`) should not be considered as actual images in the document.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust parsing strategy, possibly involving regular expressions or a full Markdown parsing library that can accurately interpret the Markdown document structure."
