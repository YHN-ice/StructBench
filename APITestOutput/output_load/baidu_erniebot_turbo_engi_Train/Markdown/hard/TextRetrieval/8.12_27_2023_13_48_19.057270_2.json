The usual format is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, where `URL` can be a local file path or a remote URL.\n\n2. **Variations in Syntax**: Markdown might have variations such as:\n   - Inline image links with or without 'Alt text' and 'Optional title'.\n   - Reference-style image links, where the URL is placed elsewhere in the document with a reference label.\n   \n3. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, characters like `!` or `[` might be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) in Markdown. Our parser should correctly handle these escape sequences.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: The parser should consider various image file extensions such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, and others.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Text that is not an image but accidentally matches the pattern of an image link should be filtered out.\n\n6. **Links Inside Code Blocks**: Links inside code blocks or inline code (enclosed by backticks) should not be considered as images.\n\n7. **Complex URLs**: Image URLs with complex structures or query parameters should be handled correctly.\n\nBy considering these challenges, we can ensure that our approach extracts all included image files accurately while avoiding false positives or missing any images due to variations in the Markdown format."
