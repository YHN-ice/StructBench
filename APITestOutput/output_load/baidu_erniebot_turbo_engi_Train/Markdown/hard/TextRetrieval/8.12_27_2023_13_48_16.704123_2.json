However, there can be variations, such as omitting the alt text, title, or using reference-style links.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might embed images using HTML `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be given as absolute URLs or relative paths, the latter may sometimes require additional context to resolve.\n\n4. **Linked Images**: Images can be linked to URLs, meaning the actual Markdown syntax for the image might be wrapped within a link syntax `[![alt text](image_url)](link_url)`.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: In some cases, image syntax could be escaped to prevent rendering, e.g., `\\![alt text](image_url)`. These should not be treated as actual images.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: We must recognize various image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif) as part of the URL or path.\n\n7. **Text Similar to Image Syntax**: There might be text within the Markdown that resembles image syntax but isn't actually an image (e.g., examples of how to write Markdown).\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: Sometimes, there can be multiple images on one line, which requires the parser to recognize each image individually.\n\n9. **Images in Lists or Blockquotes**: Images might be nested within lists or blockquotes, which could add complexity to the parsing rules.\n\n10. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some variants of Markdown allow for non-standard extensions which might have different ways to include images (e.g., shortcuts or custom tags).\n\n11. **Encoding Issues**: URLs for images might contain special characters that are URL-encoded, and these would need to be accurately interpreted.\n\n12. **Comments or Metadata**: Sometimes images are included in comments or metadata sections that are not meant to be displayed as part of the main content.\n\nTo handle these issues effectively, the parser must be robust and considerate of the various ways images can be embedded within a Markdown file."
