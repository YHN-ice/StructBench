Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Different Markdown flavors**:\nMarkdown has many flavors, such as CommonMark, GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM), etc. Each might have slightly different ways to denote bold text.\n\n2. **Multiple ways to bold text**:\nBold text in Markdown can be created using double asterisks `**Bold Text**`, double underscores `__Bold Text__`, or a combination of both in some flavors of Markdown. The parser must handle these cases.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**:\nBold text may contain other formatting inside it, like italic (`*italic*` or `_italic_`), code (`code`), or links (`[link text](url)`). The parser should extract only the bold text, while correctly handling or ignoring nested formatting.\n\n4. **False positives**:\nAsterisks and underscores can also be used for other purposes, such as bullet points, italics, or just as part of the text. The parser should distinguish these uses from actual bold formatting.\n\n5. **Escaped characters**:\nIf the asterisk or underscore characters are escaped with a backslash (`\\`), they shouldn't be treated as formatting markers.\n\n6. **Incorrectly formatted text**:\nThe source file may contain incorrectly formatted Markdown that looks like bold but isn't according to the syntax rules (like missing one asterisk in `**bold*`).\n\n7. **Line breaks and paragraphs**:\nMarkdown interpreters might handle line breaks within bold text differently. The parser needs to consider whether to include or exclude line breaks when extracting bold text.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parsing task will involve carefully analyzing the input to correctly identify and extract only the intended bold texts."
