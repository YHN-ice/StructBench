Here are some of them:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Syntaxes for Bold:** Markdown supports multiple ways to denote bold text. For example, text can be made bold by surrounding it with two asterisks `**` or two underscores `__` on each side. I need to recognize all possible syntaxes for bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might also have nested formatting within it, such as italicized words (denoted by `*` or `_`), links, or code spans. It's important to extract only the text that's bold without including the formatting characters themselves.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes, asterisks or underscores meant to bold text could be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) which means they should be treated as literal characters rather than formatting markers.\n\n4. **Inline vs Block-level Formatting:** Bold text can appear both inline with other text or in block-level elements like headings or list items. It's important to properly parse these different contexts.\n\n5. **False Positives:** Asterisks and underscores are also used for other purposes such as bullet points in lists or horizontal rules. Ensuring that these aren't mistaken for bold formatting is key.\n\n6. **Partial Formatting Errors:** There can be errors or inconsistencies where the user forgot to close the bold formatting with the appropriate markers, which could lead to difficulty determining where the bold text actually ends.\n\n7. **Text Inside Links and Images:** Bold markers could be inside link text or alt text for images, which requires additional parsing considerations.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing strategy that accounts for the context of the formatting markers, respects escape characters, and is aware of the Markdown syntax variations is necessary."
