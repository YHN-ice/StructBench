Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could be encountered:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Image Syntaxes**: Markdown has a few different ways to include images, like the inline style `![alt text](url)` and reference style where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document `![alt text][reference]`. Recognizing and properly handling each of these would be necessary.\n\n2. **Variations in Syntax**: Some Markdown processors allow for variations in the syntax, such as spaces between the parts of the syntax or omission of the 'alt text'. This can complicate extraction as it requires a more flexible approach.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using absolute URLs or relative paths. If relative paths are used, they need to be resolved in relation to the location of the Markdown file.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Text that is not an image but matches the pattern of an image link (e.g., `! [This is not an image] (text)`) could lead to false positives.\n\n5. **Nested Links or Images**: Images might be nested within other elements, such as links, which could make the regex or parsing logic more complex.\n\n6. **Image Titles**: There might be optional titles in the image syntax that need to be accounted for, like `![alt text](url \"title\")`.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that might be escaped within the Markdown, like an exclamation mark or brackets that are part of the image description rather than the syntax.\n\n8. **HTML Tags**: The Markdown file might also contain HTML tags for embedding images, which would require a different parsing approach than Markdown syntax.\n\n9. **Linked Images**: Sometimes images are linked so that when you click them they take you to another webpage. This would involve parsing both the image and link syntax.\n\n10. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors extend the syntax with features not found in other versions, such as resizing images directly in the Markdown file.\n\nTo extract the image file names correctly, the parser must account for all these nuances and still be able to distinguish between actual image links and other similar-looking Markdown constructs."
