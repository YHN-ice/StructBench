Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might occur while performing this task:\n\n1. **Variations in Image Syntax**: Markdown allows for different ways to include images. The standard syntax is `![Alt text](URL or path to image)`, but variations could exist, such as reference-style images or HTML image tags embedded within the Markdown.\n\n2. **Complex Paths or URLs**: Image file paths or URLs could be complex, containing query parameters, fragments, or being relative/absolute paths. Extracting the exact file names might require parsing these URLs and paths correctly.\n\n3. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions that allow for non-standard ways to include images (like shortcuts, plugins, or additional syntax). This could make it challenging to identify all image files without knowing which extensions are in use.\n\n4. **Encoded or Escaped Characters**: File names in URLs might be URL-encoded (e.g., spaces replaced with `%20`), or certain characters in the Markdown might be escaped, which would require decoding for accurate extraction.\n\n5. **Text That Looks Like Image Syntax**: Sometimes, there might be examples of Markdown syntax within a code block or inline code that are not actual images but merely illustrative text. These should not be confused with real image references.\n\n6. **Linked Images**: Images can also be links, meaning the syntax could be nested within link syntax `[![Alt text](URL to image)](URL to page)`. Extracting the image file name from within the link syntax adds another layer of complexity.\n\n7. **Incorrect Syntax**: If the Markdown file contains errors or incorrect image syntax, it could lead to missed or incorrectly extracted file names.\n\nTo accurately extract all included image files, the parser must handle these situations effectively."
