The most common methods are `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`, but it's important to confirm which method is used in the given file.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags, such as italic (`*italic*` or `_italic_`), strikethrough (`~~strikethrough~~`), or within links (`[link text](url)`). Properly extracting the bold text might require parsing the nested structures.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Markdown allows escaping special characters with a backslash (`\\`). For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be interpreted as bold text. The parser must recognize and handle escaped characters appropriately.\n\n4. **Inline code blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (denoted by backticks: `` `code` ``) should not be treated as formatted text, so any bold markers within these blocks should be ignored.\n\n5. **Code blocks and fenced code blocks**: Similarly, text within code blocks (indented by four spaces or tabs) or fenced code blocks (surrounded by triple backticks ``` or triple tildes ~~~) should not be considered for formatting.\n\n6. **False positives**: Text that coincidentally contains double asterisks or underscores but is not intended to be bold could be mistakenly recognized as bold text (for example, mathematical expressions or certain emoticons).\n\n7. **Partial formatting**: Situations where the bold syntax is not properly closed, which may lead to confusion on what constitutes the bold text.\n\n8. **Line breaks**: In some Markdown flavors, line breaks can affect formatting. For example, text that is separated by a newline without a blank line in between may still be considered part of the same paragraph and thus maintain its bold formatting.\n\n9. **Overlapping formatting**: Situations where bold formatting overlaps with other formatting, such as `**bold _italic and bold_**`, need careful parsing to extract only the bold parts correctly.\n\n10. **Link labels**: In reference-style links, the label might use bold formatting, which should be extracted if we're interested in all instances of bold text.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties"
