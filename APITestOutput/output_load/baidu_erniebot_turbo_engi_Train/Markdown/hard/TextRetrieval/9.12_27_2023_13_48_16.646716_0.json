The parser must be able to recognize all of these patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text can also include other formatting, such as italics, strikethroughs, or inline code. The parser needs to handle nested formatting without confusing it with the bold markers.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Users can escape Markdown syntax characters with a backslash (`\\`). For example, `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*` should not be treated as bold text. The parser must differentiate between escaped and unescaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **Inline vs Block Elements:** Markdown contains both inline elements (like bold or italic) and block elements (like headers or lists). Bold text can appear within block elements, and the parser must correctly process inline formatting within these contexts.\n\n5. **False Positives:** There might be instances where double asterisks or underscores do not denote bold text, such as in code blocks or URLs. The parser must be careful not to interpret these as formatting.\n\n6. **Partial Formatting:** Sometimes the Markdown syntax may not be perfectly followed, resulting in partial formatting. For example, `**bold` without a closing `**` could be an error in the document. The parser must decide how to handle these cases.\n\nGiven the above challenges, a robust Markdown parser needs to have a well-defined strategy for identifying and extracting bold texts accurately."
