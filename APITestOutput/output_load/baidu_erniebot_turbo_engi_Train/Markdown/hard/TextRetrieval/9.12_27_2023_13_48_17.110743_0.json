The parser must be capable of recognizing both formats.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italics, strikethrough, or even links. Parsing nested formatting correctly can be complex.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with backslashes in Markdown, which means they shouldn't be interpreted as formatting characters (e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`). The parser needs to handle escaped characters appropriately.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: If a file contains incomplete bold syntax (e.g., `**bold without closing`), it could lead to incorrect extraction or might require a decision on how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (indented with 4 spaces or surrounded by triple backticks ```) and inline code (surrounded by single backticks `) should not be interpreted as formatted text, including bold.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Bold syntax within links (`[**link**](url)`) and image descriptions (`![**image**](url)`) might be more challenging to extract, as the parser should avoid capturing the surrounding link/image syntax.\n\n7. **Parsing Efficiency**: Depending on the size of the Markdown file, the efficiency of the parsing algorithm may become an issue. It's important the parser is optimized for performance.\n\n8. **Human Errors in the Markdown File**: People might introduce errors or use non-standard ways to denote bold text in Markdown files which could complicate parsing.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties will be essential for producing an accurate and robust Markdown file parser. Now, if you provide the input Markdown file, I can attempt to extract the bold texts according to its contents."
