The standard syntax is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there could be variations such as images with or without alt text, with additional title attributes, or with different spacings.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style links and images, where the URL is not inline but rather defined elsewhere in the document. Identifying and correctly linking these references can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files include HTML tags for more complex formatting. Images might be included using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Image URLs can be relative to the document or absolute URLs (including external links). Identifying and handling these differences is necessary to extract meaningful file names.\n\n5. **Linked Images**: An image can also be a hyperlink, enclosed in a regular link syntax. In such cases, the parser has to distinguish between the URL of the image and the URL of the hyperlink.\n\n6. **Non-image Files**: The parser must differentiate between image file links and links to other types of files like PDFs or documents.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows for escaping characters that might otherwise be interpreted as markup. Ensuring that escaped image syntax is not incorrectly parsed as an actual image is important.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Text that happens to look like Markdown image syntax but isn't intended to represent an image (for example, in code blocks or quoted text) should not be extracted as an image file.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown Content**: Sometimes, images might be within nested content like lists or blockquotes, which might affect how the parser needs to search for the image syntax.\n\nTo accurately extract all included image files, a parser will need to overcome these obstacles and carefully analyze the Markdown content."
