The most common one is `![alt text](image_url)`, but there could be variations or shortcuts used by different Markdown dialects that might need to be accounted for.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images**: Some Markdown documents use reference-style links for images, where the image URL is not inline with the image tag but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown allows embedding raw HTML, so images might be embedded using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Encoded or Data URLs**: Image sources might not always be file paths or URLs; they could also be encoded data directly within the Markdown document.\n\n5. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths could be relative to the Markdown file location or absolute URLs; these need to be identified correctly.\n\n6. **Alternate Text Overlap**: The alt text description in the image syntax might include parentheses and square brackets, which could confuse a simple parser.\n\n7. **Links vs Images**: Distinguishing between regular links and images could be tricky, as their syntax is quite similar in Markdown.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Image syntax might include escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown**: Images might be nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes, affecting the regular expression that might be used for matching.\n\n10. **File Extensions**: To ensure that a URL is an image file, it would typically have an image file extension like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. However, there may be cases where the image URL does not contain a clear file extension, and heuristic or content-based detection might be required.\n\n11. **Comments**: Markdown does not natively support comments, but in some implementations HTML comments may be used and could contain image-like syntax that should not be extracted.\n\n12. **File Availability**: If required to verify the existence of the image files, there may be difficulty accessing external URLs or checking for file existence if paths are relative.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, extracting image filenames will require careful parsing and potentially some assumptions about the formatting and contents of the given Markdown input."
