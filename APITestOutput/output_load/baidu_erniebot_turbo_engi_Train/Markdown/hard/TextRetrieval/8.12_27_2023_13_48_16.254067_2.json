An absolute URL includes the full path (e.g., `https://example.com/image.jpg`), while a relative URL points to a file within the same directory or site structure (e.g., `images/image.jpg`). Extracting the filename might require handling both types of links correctly.\n\n3. **Link References**: Markdown also allows images to be referenced using link references which could look like this:\n\n   ```markdown\n   ![Alt text][image-id]\n\n   [image-id]: URL\n   ```\n   \n   This means that the parser would need to keep track of reference-style links and their corresponding URLs.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, images are embedded using raw HTML instead of Markdown syntax within a Markdown file. The parser would need to be able to recognize `<img>` tags and their `src` attributes.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: URLs within Markdown files might be encoded (e.g., spaces replaced by `%20`), and the parser would have to decode these to extract the correct filename.\n\n6. **Images as Hyperlinks**: Images can also be part of a hyperlink, where the Markdown syntax involves an additional layer of square brackets. The parser should not confuse the hyperlink with the image syntax.\n\n7. **Comments or Disabled Links**: Sometimes, images might be commented out or their links might be disabled (e.g., by removing the exclamation mark). The parser should ignore these instances.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There might be multiple images included on a single line, and the parser would need to extract each one separately.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be robust and flexible in handling various Markdown structures and conventions related to image embedding."
