The standard format is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations may exist. Some Markdown parsers might use non-standard formats or have additional whitespace or characters which could complicate extraction.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in Markdown can be linked with relative paths or full URLs. We need to ensure that we correctly identify and extract both types of paths.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, Markdown files may include raw HTML tags for more complex formatting, such as `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"Description\" />`. This can make it trickier to find all image references as we'd need to parse HTML as well as Markdown.\n\n4. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image definition but instead is referenced elsewhere in the document, like `![Alt text][id]` and then `[id]: URL \"Optional title\"`. This would require collecting reference definitions and then matching them up with usage in the document.\n\n5. **Linked Images**: Some images may be hyperlinked, which means that the image syntax is nested within a link syntax. This adds another layer of complexity to the parsing.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Markdown allows for escape characters to treat Markdown syntax characters as literal characters. For example, an exclamation mark can be escaped to prevent an image from being rendered, like this: `\\![Not an image](/path/to/image.png)`.\n\nTo correctly extract all image file names, a parser must handle all these cases and possibly more, depending on the Markdown dialect and the specificities of the input file."
