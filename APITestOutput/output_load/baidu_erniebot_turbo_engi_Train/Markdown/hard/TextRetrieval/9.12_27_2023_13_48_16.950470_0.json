The most common are double asterisks `**text**` or double underscores `__text__`. Ensuring that the parser recognizes both could be a challenge.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, code spans `` `code` ``, or even other bold or italic markers. The parser must correctly handle these nested elements without mistaking them for separate bold sections.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the bold syntax to prevent it from being parsed (`\\**not bold\\**`). The parser needs to differentiate between escaped and unescaped characters.\n\n4. **Incorrect Markdown Syntax**: If the Markdown is incorrectly written (e.g., missing a closing asterisk `**bold*`), the parser needs to decide whether to be strict and ignore such patterns or try to handle them gracefully.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: Bold text right next to other characters without whitespace (e.g., `text**bold**text`) could be a parsing edge case.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Markdown may allow bold text to span multiple lines, which could complicate the regex or parsing rules if they are line-based.\n\n7. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is very large, the parser must be efficient enough to extract the bold texts without significant performance impact.\n\nThese challenges must be addressed by the parser logic or regular expression used to ensure accurate extraction of all bold text segments."
