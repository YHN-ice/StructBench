We need to account for all the variations in syntax.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Image links can be relative paths to files within the same repository or project, or absolute URLs to images hosted elsewhere. We need to identify and extract both types.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inlined but defined elsewhere in the document. This requires identifying and resolving these references.\n\n4. **Images within HTML Tags**: Sometimes, images are embedded using HTML tags like `<img src=\"image.png\" />` within Markdown files, which would require parsing HTML as well.\n\n5. **Links vs. Images**: Distinguishing between image files and hyperlinks to web pages might be tricky if the syntax is similar.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: We must recognize various image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.) while ignoring non-image files.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, characters within an image's syntax might be escaped (for example, \\!\\[Alt text\\]\\(URL\\)), which could complicate extraction if not handled properly.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown Elements**: An image link could be nested inside other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might make extraction more complex.\n\n9. **Incorrect Markdown**: If the file contains incorrectly formatted Markdown, it might be challenging to reliably extract image file names.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: The file encoding might affect how we read and interpret the content, especially for non-ASCII characters in the image filenames or alt text.\n\nConsidering these potential issues will help in creating a robust approach to extracting image file names from a Markdown document."
