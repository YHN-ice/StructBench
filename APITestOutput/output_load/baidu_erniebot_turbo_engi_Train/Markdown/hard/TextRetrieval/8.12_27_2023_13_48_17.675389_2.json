The parser must handle all possible variations.\n\n2. **Complex File Paths**: Image sources might include simple filenames, relative paths, or complete URLs. The parser needs to correctly identify and extract only the filenames or paths, ignoring URL parameters or anchors.\n\n3. **Link Confusion**: Markdown syntax for links is similar to that for images, with the only difference being an exclamation point before the brackets for images. The parser must differentiate between links and image references.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Filenames might include special characters that are escaped in Markdown. The parser will have to unescape these characters to get the correct filenames.\n\n5. **Non-Standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown files may use extensions or variants that are not part of the standard Markdown specification, potentially requiring additional logic to handle.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: An image syntax might be nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes, which may complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Alt Text Variability**: The alternative text for images might include brackets (`[]`) or other characters that could confuse a simple parser that is not accounting for context.\n\n8. **File Extension Recognition**: The parser must recognize image file extensions (like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.) and ignore non-image files.\n\n9. **In-line Text or Code Blocks**: Images might be included within inline code blocks or fenced code blocks, in which case they should not be treated as actual images to extract.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a robust Markdown parser should use regular expressions or a parsing library designed to handle Markdown's syntax rules and edge cases. It should also maintain a list of image file extensions to check against when extracting filenames."
