A parser must handle all these cases correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can be nested within other elements like lists, quotes, or headers. The parser needs to correctly navigate the structure to find bold text wherever it is.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape bold syntax characters to prevent them from being interpreted as Markdown, like \\**not bold\\**. The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: In some cases, users might incorrectly format the bold syntax, like **this*. The parser has to decide whether to be strict and ignore this or attempt to recover from the error.\n\n5. **Links or Images within Bold**: Markdown allows for links or images to be included within bold sections. The parser should extract the bold text while handling or excluding the link/image markup as required.\n\n6. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks using backticks (`) should not be considered as bold, even if it contains bold syntax characters.\n\n7. **Overlapping Elements**: There could be overlapping formatting elements where bold intersects with italics or strikethrough text.\n\n8. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text can span multiple lines, which may require handling line breaks within the bold section.\n\nEach of these challenges requires careful consideration and robust parsing logic to ensure the correct extraction of bold texts from a Markdown file."
