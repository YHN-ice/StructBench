Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise in the process:\n\n1. **Markdown Image Syntax Variations**: The standard Markdown syntax for images is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but there may be variations or deviations from this format that need to be accounted for.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in Markdown can be linked using either relative or absolute paths. Distinguishing between these and extracting the file name might require additional processing.\n\n3. **Reference Style Images**: Markdown also allows images to be included using reference style, where the URL is not inline with the image tag but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML Tags**: Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax, which requires different parsing logic.\n\n5. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes, links and images can be confused due to their similar syntax. It's essential to ensure that only image file names are extracted and not URLs from regular links.\n\n6. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be lines with multiple images, and the parser should be able to extract all image names from such lines.\n\n7. **File Name Extraction**: After identifying the image URLs or paths, extracting just the file names (if required) from those paths might involve additional string manipulation.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: There may be escaped characters within the Markdown file that need to be handled correctly during parsing.\n\n9. **Special Characters in File Names**: File names may contain spaces or special characters that are encoded in the Markdown file which needs to be accounted for when extracting them.\n\n10. **Incorrect Markdown Syntax**: The parser must handle cases where the Markdown syntax is incorrect or partially missing, which could lead to false positives or negatives during extraction.\n\nUnderstanding these potential challenges will help us to create a more robust solution for extracting image file names from the given Markdown input."
