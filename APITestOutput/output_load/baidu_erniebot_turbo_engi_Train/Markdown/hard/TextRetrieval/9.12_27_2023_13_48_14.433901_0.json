I need to ensure that I can recognize both forms.\n\n2. **Inline formatting**: Bold text might be within a sentence, so it's important to accurately extract only the bold part without including surrounding non-bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to display them as literal characters, which means they should not be interpreted as bold syntax. For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be extracted as bold.\n\n4. **Nested formatting**: Bold syntax might be nested within other markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or code blocks. It's important to only extract bold text from plain text regions and not from code blocks or other elements where the formatting would not normally apply.\n\n5. **Links and images**: Bold syntax might interact with links or images, which could complicate the parsing. For example, a link might have a portion of its text bolded, or an image's alt text might be bolded.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text**: Markdown allows for bold text to span multiple lines. The parser should correctly handle and extract multiline bold sections.\n\n7. **Incorrectly formatted Markdown**: Users may make mistakes in their Markdown, such as missing an asterisk or underscore, which could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, I'll need to consider these potential issues and handle them appropriately when processing the input file."
