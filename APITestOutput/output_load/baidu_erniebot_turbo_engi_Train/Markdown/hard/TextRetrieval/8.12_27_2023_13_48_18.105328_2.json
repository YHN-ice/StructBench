The most common way to include an image is `![Alt text](URL)`, but variations might include different spacing or the inclusion of title attributes.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be included using relative paths that relate to the location of the Markdown file, or they could use absolute paths that point to a specific location on the web or within a file system.\n\n3. **Linked Images**: Sometimes images are included as links, which means the image URL is nested within a link's URL syntax. This adds complexity to parsing.\n\n4. **Non-Image URLs**: URLs that aren't images might be present and formatted similarly to image links, such as links to websites or other types of files.\n\n5. **Inline HTML**: Markdown also allows for raw HTML, so images could be included using `<img>` tags rather than the usual `![]()` syntax.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: The markdown might contain escaped characters that prevent the parser from recognizing an image link.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line, requiring the parser to recognize and extract each individual image file name.\n\n8. **Different File Extensions**: Image files can have various extensions like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc., and all valid image file types should be considered.\n\n9. **Text That Looks Like Image Syntax**: There could be parts of the text that accidentally or intentionally resemble image syntax but aren't meant to be images.\n\n10. **References-Style Links**: Markdown allows for referencing-style links where the URL is not inline with the alt text but is instead defined elsewhere in the document.\n\nEach of these scenarios would require careful consideration in the logic used to parse the Markdown file in order to accurately extract only the intended image file names."
