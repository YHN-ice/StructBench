We have to account for variations like inline image syntax, reference-style images, and potentially non-standard syntax extensions.\n\n2. **Complex URLs**: Image URLs can be simple filenames (e.g., `image.png`) or full URLs (e.g., `http://example.com/image.png`). They could also include query parameters or fragments.\n\n3. **Alternate Text**: The alt text for images could potentially include characters that might confuse a simple parser (like `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, etc.).\n\n4. **Reference Style Links**: If the document uses reference-style image inclusions, we'll have to find and correctly resolve the reference to the actual URL.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Markdown allows for characters to be escaped, which could mean that what looks like an image inclusion at first glance is actually not.\n\n6. **Markdown within Code Blocks**: Image syntax within code blocks should not be treated as actual images because they are meant to display as code rather than render an image.\n\n7. **Image Titles/Captions**: Optional titles/captions can follow the URL in quotes. These are not part of the filename but are part of the syntax for including an image.\n\nTo accurately extract all included image files, we need to consider these factors and ensure that our method can correctly identify and parse the image links from the Markdown content while avoiding false positives."
