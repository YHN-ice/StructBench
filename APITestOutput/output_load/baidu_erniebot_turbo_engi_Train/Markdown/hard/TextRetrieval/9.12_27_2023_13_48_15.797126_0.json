Recognizing and handling these variations correctly would be necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting nested inside it, such as italic (`*text*` or `_text_`), code spans (`` `code` ``), or links (`[link text](URL)`). We would need to ensure that only the bold text is extracted, not the formatting characters or the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the bold syntax to prevent it from being parsed as such (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). We would need to recognize and ignore these escaped formats.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Paired Markers**: There could be instances where the bold markers are not correctly paired or formatted, which could lead to confusion about what text is meant to be bold.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines. The parser should be able to handle multiline text and still extract it correctly.\n\n6. **Interference with Other Markdown Elements**: Bold syntax may be interrupted by other Markdown elements like blockquotes, lists, or headers, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **Inline HTML**: If the Markdown file uses inline HTML for bold text (e.g., `<strong>text</strong>`), it would be another variation to account for.\n\nThese are just a few potential issues that could make extracting all bold texts from a Markdown file challenging. Once we have the input file, we would need to address these difficulties accordingly."
