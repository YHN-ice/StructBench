In Markdown, images are typically included using the following syntax:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](URL_of_image \"Optional title\")\n```\nwhere `Alt text` is the alternative text used for the image, `URL_of_image` is the path to the image file, and `Optional title` is an optional title for the image.\n\nSome potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process include:\n\n1. **Variations in the image syntax**: While the standard Markdown syntax for embedding images is consistent, there might be variations or extensions used by different Markdown interpreters that could affect how images are embedded.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: The URLs for images can be either relative paths or absolute URLs. Relative paths need to be resolved based on the context of the Markdown file.\n\n3. **Reference-style image links**: Markdown also supports reference-style links, where the URL and optional title are defined elsewhere in the document. Recognizing and resolving these could be tricky.\n\n4. **Incorrectly formatted image syntax**: If the Markdown file contains errors in the image syntax, such as missing brackets or parentheses, it might be difficult to accurately identify and extract image file names.\n\n5. **Images embedded in HTML**: Sometimes, images are embedded in Markdown using raw HTML tags. This requires a different parsing strategy to extract the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag.\n\n6. **Links that resemble image syntax**: A regular link that resembles an image embed but lacks an exclamation mark at the beginning might confuse the parser if not properly accounted for.\n\n7. **Embedded data URIs**: Images can also be embedded using data URIs directly in the Markdown file, which is not a file path but encoded image data.\n\n8. **Markdown comments**: Images could be included inside Markdown comments which should not typically be processed as part of the visible content.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a Markdown file parser must carefully process the input to accurately extract all included image files' names."
