I need to be able to handle both.\n\n2. **Complex URLs**: The image URLs might be complex with query parameters or anchors, so I have to make sure to extract the entire URL correctly.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be linked using either relative or absolute paths, and I need to distinguish between them if necessary.\n\n4. **Nested Markdown Elements**: An image link could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might complicate regex patterns.\n\n5. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors extend the basic syntax, and if the file uses such extensions, standard parsing might not work.\n\n6. **Broken Syntax**: The Markdown file might contain broken or incomplete image syntax, which could lead to incorrect or missed extractions.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: The presence of escape characters in the Markdown could affect the parsing process.\n\n8. **Alternative Text Complexity**: The alt text for images might contain characters that could be confused with Markdown syntax, such as brackets or parentheses.\n\n9. **Encoded URLs**: Image URLs might be URL-encoded, which means special characters are replaced with a percentage (%) sign followed by two hex digits, complicating the extraction process.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser would need to implement robust pattern matching and possibly some logic to handle special cases. Now, you can provide the input file to proceed with actual parsing and extracting image file names."
