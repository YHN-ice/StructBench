Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Different Image Syntaxes**: Markdown supports different ways to include images, both inline and reference-style. Inline images are included with `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, while reference-style images use `![Alt text][id]` and define the URL elsewhere in the document like `[id]: URL \"Optional title\"`. Ensuring that the parser recognizes both styles is necessary.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be either relative to the document or absolute URLs. Handling both correctly and extracting only the file names could be tricky.\n\n3. **Variations in URL**: Some URLs might point to external resources that aren't actual 'files' (e.g., links to web pages) or might contain query parameters or fragments that aren't part of the file name.\n\n4. **HTML Embedding**: Sometimes, images might be embedded using raw HTML within the Markdown file, like `<img src=\"filename.jpg\">`. A comprehensive parser should handle this case as well.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: There might be escape characters in Markdown to avoid the image syntax being parsed as an actual image, like `!\\[Image\\](image.png)` which should not be counted as an image file.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown**: Sometimes, Markdown files contain other Markdown elements inside the image alt text which could complicate the parsing.\n\n7. **Links without Images**: Links in Markdown might look similar to images but without the leading exclamation point. It’s important not to confuse these with actual images.\n\n8. **Unusual File Extensions**: The parser must recognize all possible image file extensions (like .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.) and not just assume a common one.\n\n9. **Title Attributes**: Title attributes after the URL are optional and enclosed in double quotes \"\". They should not be mistaken for part of the file name.\n\n10. **Commented-Out Images**: Images might be commented out using HTML comments `<!-- ![Alt text](URL) -->` or using a comment syntax specific to a Markdown renderer and should typically not be counted as included images.\n\nHandling these cases would require a robust parsing algorithm capable of accurately identifying and extracting only the correct image file names from the Markdown content."
