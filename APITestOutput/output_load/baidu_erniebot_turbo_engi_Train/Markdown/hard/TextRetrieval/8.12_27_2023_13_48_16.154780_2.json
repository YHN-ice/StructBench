The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. However, there could be variations with spaces, different order of elements, or even the use of reference-style links.\n\n2. **Inline Images vs Reference Images**: Besides the inline image format, Markdown also supports reference-style images. In this case, the image URL is not specified inline but is linked to a reference elsewhere in the document. This requires detecting both the reference and its definition.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image file paths can be relative to the location of the Markdown file or absolute URLs. Absolute URLs might not refer to actual files within the file system, but external resources.\n\n4. **Different File Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. The parser must identify all possible image file types.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes characters (like `!` or `[`) might be escaped to avoid being interpreted as Markdown, which might lead to false negatives when parsing.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Markdown elements could be nested within others, such as an image inside a hyperlink. The parser should correctly identify and extract only the image part.\n\n7. **Invalid Markdown**: The file could contain incorrectly formatted Markdown or typos that could lead to missing some images during parsing.\n\n8. **Non-image Links**: Links to non-image files or external pages that look similar to image links need to be distinguished and not mistaken for image files.\n\nTo give an accurate answer, the parser must be able to navigate these challenges successfully."
