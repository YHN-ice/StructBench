We must account for both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text may have nested elements like links or italics. For example, `**bold _italic_ text**`. Extracting just the bold part without including the nested styles may be tricky.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: In Markdown, asterisks and underscores can be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being parsed as styling, like `\\**not bold\\**`. We need to ignore escaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Text might contain asterisks or underscores that are not meant for formatting, such as in code blocks or inline code. We should not interpret these as bold text.\n\n5. **Balancing Pairs of Delimiters**: It is necessary to ensure that the bold text is correctly delimited by pairs of `**` or `__`.\n\n6. **Line Breaks within Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and we need to handle the line breaks appropriately.\n\n7. **Incomplete Delimiters**: Sometimes, a user might forget to close the bold syntax with the appropriate delimiter, which can cause parsing issues.\n\nIdentifying and correctly processing these cases is crucial for accurately extracting bold texts from a Markdown file."
