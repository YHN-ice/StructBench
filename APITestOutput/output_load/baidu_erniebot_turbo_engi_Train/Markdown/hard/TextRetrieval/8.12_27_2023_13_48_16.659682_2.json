The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations and shorthand notations might also be used.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Markdown allows inline HTML. An image could be included using an `<img>` tag with various attributes.\n\n3. **Reference-style Links**: Images might be included using reference-style links, where the URL is provided elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: If the Markdown file contains escaped characters that resemble the image syntax, these should not be mistaken for actual images.\n\n5. **Nested Markdown**: Images might be nested inside other elements like lists or blockquotes, which may affect how the syntax is parsed.\n\n6. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The paths to image files could be relative or absolute, and it's important to extract the correct path regardless.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some flavors of Markdown include extensions that allow for additional ways to include images, such as shortcodes or custom tags.\n\n8. **Links vs. Images**: The parser must distinguish between links and images, as their syntax is similar in Markdown.\n\n9. **Distractions in Alt Text**: Sometimes, alt text might contain sequences that resemble Markdown syntax. It's important to correctly parse the actual link to the image rather than being misled by alt text.\n\n10. **File Names with Special Characters**: File names might contain spaces, special characters, or unicode characters that need to be accurately captured.\n\nGiven the variety of potential obstacles, it's crucial for a parser to be robust and flexible enough to handle these cases correctly. Now, let's see the actual Markdown file input to proceed with the extraction of image filenames."
