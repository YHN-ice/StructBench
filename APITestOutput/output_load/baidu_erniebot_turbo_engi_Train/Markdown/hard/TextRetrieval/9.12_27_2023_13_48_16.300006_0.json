We need to ensure that we recognize all methods.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements like links, images, or even italic text. It could be challenging to extract just the bold text without including these nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores can be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to prevent them from being parsed as Markdown syntax. We'll need to handle these cases correctly.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There might be cases where asterisks or underscores are used in a context that doesn't correspond to bold text (e.g., in code snippets, mathematical expressions, or within words).\n\n5. **Partial Matches**: It's possible to encounter partial matches where only one asterisk or underscore is used, which does not signify bold text.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Bold text can span multiple lines, so we need to account for line breaks within bold segments.\n\n7. **Inconsistencies in Formatting**: Users may make mistakes in formatting, such as mismatched symbols or uneven spacing, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. **Overlapping Formats**: Bold text might overlap with other formatting styles like strikethrough or blockquotes, potentially causing confusion.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, we can apply the appropriate regex patterns or parsing algorithms to extract the relevant bold texts while accounting for these potential issues."
