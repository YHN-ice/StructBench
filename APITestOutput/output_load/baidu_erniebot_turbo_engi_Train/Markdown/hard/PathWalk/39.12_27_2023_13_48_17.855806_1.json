It needs to distinguish between different levels of headings (`#` for sections, `##` for subsections, `###` for subsubsections, etc.).\n\n2. **Numerical Ordering**: The parser must correctly interpret the numerical ordering of sections and subsections. Markdown files do not have explicit numbering, so the parser needs to keep track of the order in which headings appear.\n\n3. **Nested Content Extraction**: Once the correct subsubsection is identified, the parser has to extract not only the heading line but also any content that belongs to that subsubsection, stopping before the next heading of the same or higher level.\n\n4. **Formatting Preservation**: The content should be extracted with its original markdown formatting intact. This includes preserving line breaks, lists, code blocks, emphasis, and other markdown syntax elements.\n\n5. **Link/Image Reference Resolution**: If there are any links or images that are referenced within the content, it’s important to include them as they appear in markdown, even if they use reference-style links with the URL defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. **Handling Ambiguities**: The parser must handle potential ambiguities in the markdown, such as headings that are not properly spaced from the preceding text or unusual heading levels that might not follow conventional practices.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: The parser should be prepared to handle errors or irregularities in the markdown file structure (e.g., a missing subsubsection or an incorrectly formatted heading).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, it will be important for the parser to have a robust logic for navigating through the markdown's hierarchical structure and extracting the relevant content with all its formatting details."
