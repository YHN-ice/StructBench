Making sure these are included as they appear in the source could be important, depending on the requirements.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Quotes**: These blocks might span multiple lines and are separate from the main content by indentation or backticks. It's important to recognize and extract them in their entirety if they are part of the requested content.\n\n6. **Tables**: Markdown allows for tables which have their own specific syntax.
