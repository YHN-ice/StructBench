These should not be confused with content when parsing text.\n\n7. **Lists and Other Constructs**: Other Markdown constructs like lists, blockquotes, code blocks, and tables have their own syntax that must be handled.\n\n8. **Link References**: Markdown allows for linking using various methods, including reference-style links, which might interrupt the flow if not accounted for.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we'll need to analyze the input file carefully to ensure we extract the right content.
