If these terms were used in the file to refer to sections, it could lead to confusion.\n\n5. **Content spread across lines**: The content of the subsection may not be in a single block but spread across multiple lines or paragraphs, requiring the parser to collect all related lines until the next heading.\n\n6. **Links, images, and formatting**: The subsection content might contain links, images, or formatted text (like bold or italic), which would need to be preserved in the excerpt.\n\n7. **Code blocks or quotes**: If the subsection contains code blocks or quotes, it needs to ensure that indentation and formatting are maintained in the excerpt.\n\n8. **Other non-textual elements**: There could be lists, tables, or other elements that require proper handling to maintain the original structure and meaning.\n\n9. **Human error in input**: Typos or incorrect references in the question (like \"1th\" instead of \"1st\") that would need clarification before processing.\n\nOnce we have the actual Markdown file, these potential obstacles will guide the parsing and extraction process to ensure accuracy in locating and providing the requested content."
