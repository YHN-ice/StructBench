It's important to correctly identify the hierarchy to extract the correct subsection.\n\n2. **Ambiguous Headings:** Headings in Markdown are identified by `#` symbols. Differentiating between sections and subsections requires counting these symbols to determine the hierarchy level.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting:** Not all Markdown files follow strict formatting guidelines. Inconsistencies like skipping heading levels or using alternative symbols for bullet points can complicate parsing.\n\n4. **Links and Embedded Content:** If the subsection includes links or embedded content like images or videos, these need to be correctly identified and included in the excerpt.\n\n5. **Markup vs. Plain Text:** Markdown can include inline formatting such as italics, bold, and code. When providing an excerpt, it is necessary to decide whether to return the text with or without these inline styles.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Lists:** The subsection may contain code blocks or lists that have their own indentation rules in Markdown. It's important to maintain the structure when extracting these elements.\n\n7. **Length of Content:** If the subsection is lengthy, it might be challenging to determine how much content to include in the excerpt.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, precise parsing rules need to be established, and possibly a context-aware processing mechanism should be in place to correctly interpret the structure and content of the Markdown file."
