Keeping track of the specific level (section, subsection, subsubsection) and their order can be challenging.\n\n2. **Ambiguity in Heading Levels**: Different Markdown files may use different conventions for headings (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.). Without a consistent structure, it can be difficult to determine the hierarchical level of each heading.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Numbering**: Some Markdown files may include explicit numbering for sections (e.g., `1.`, `1.1.`, `1.1.1.`) while others may not. This can make it harder to identify the correct section referred to by \"2th section\" or \"2th subsubsection\".\n\n4. **Variability in Markup**: Markdown allows for variability in how content is marked up (e.g., some may use bullet points while others use numbered lists, or variations in emphasis). Parsing these correctly while maintaining the intent of the content can be complex.\n\n5. **Link and Image References**: If the content includes links or images, correctly parsing and returning the raw Markdown (including alt text and URLs for images, or anchor text and URLs for links) can add an extra layer of complexity.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Markdown supports code blocks and inline code, which should be handled differently than regular text to preserve formatting.\n\n7. **Table Content**: If the content includes tables, parsing them while maintaining the intended structure could be difficult, as Markdown tables can vary in complexity.\n\n8. **Text Formatting**: Bold, italic, strikethrough, and other text formatting need to be correctly identified and preserved in the output.\n\n9. **File Size and Performance**: If the input Markdown file is very large, performance issues might arise when parsing and searching through the content.\n\n10. **Human Error**: Mistypes or misinterpretation of the \"2th\" as \"2nd\" could lead to incorrect information being provided, as \"2th\" is not a standard ordinal indicator.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a careful and systematic approach to parsing the Markdown file will be necessary, ensuring that all levels of headings are correctly identified and that the content under them is accurately extracted as it appears in the file."
