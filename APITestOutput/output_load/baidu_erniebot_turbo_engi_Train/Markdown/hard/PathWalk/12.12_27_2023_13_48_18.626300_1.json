It should be \"second subsection under second section\". Clarifying the correct ordinal terms would be necessary to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Nested Structure**: Markdown allows for nested structures using different levels of headings. Identifying the correct subsection requires understanding the hierarchy of the headings.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the Markdown file doesn't follow a consistent format for sections and subsections, it might be challenging to programmatically distinguish between different levels.\n\n4. **Complex Markdown Elements**: The presence of complex Markdown elements like tables, lists, or embedded HTML could complicate parsing and extracting the text content.\n\n5. **Large File Size**: If the Markdown file is very large, it could pose performance issues when processing and identifying the requested content.\n\n6. **Linked Content**: If the subsection contains links to other documents or sections within the document, it might be necessary to resolve those links to provide a complete answer.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: The file encoding might cause issues if it's not in a standard format that the parser expects (e.g., UTF-8).
