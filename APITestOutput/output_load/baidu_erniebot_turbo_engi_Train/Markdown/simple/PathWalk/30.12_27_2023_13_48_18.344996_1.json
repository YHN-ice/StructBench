Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Identifying Section and Subsection Levels**: Markdown uses `#` for headings, with the number of `#` characters indicating the level of the section. Determining what constitutes the \"1st section\" and its subsections requires interpreting this structure correctly.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the Markdown file is not consistently formatted (e.g., using different numbers of spaces after `#`), it might be challenging to programmatically identify sections and subsections.\n\n3. **Nested Subsections**: The file might contain nested subsections, which would require a method to accurately traverse and identify the correct level of nesting for the \"1st subsection under the 1st section.\"\n\n4. **Content Extraction**: Once the correct subsection is identified, the content needs to be extracted while preserving the original Markdown formatting, including any inline elements like links, emphasis, or code spans.\n\n5. **Ambiguity in Header Counting**: Without a clear definition, there might be ambiguity in what constitutes the \"1st section.\" For example, there could be preamble text or a table of contents before the first numbered heading.\n\n6. **Non-text Elements**: The subsection could contain non-text elements like images or tables, which should be included in the excerpt if they are part of the content.\n\nThese challenges require a careful reading of the Markdown structure and potentially a parsing algorithm to navigate through headings and content."
