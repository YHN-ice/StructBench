Maintain the formatting and syntax of Markdown, such as lists, code blocks, emphasis, links, images, and blockquotes.\n5. Deal with potential ambiguities in Markdown syntax, such as when a line might be interpreted as text or a heading, depending on the context.\n\nPotential difficulties in parsing a markdown file could include:\n\n- **Ambiguous Headings**: Markdown does not strictly enforce the uniqueness of headings, so there may be multiple sections with the same heading that need differentiating.\n- **Inconsistent Spacing**: Some Markdown parsers require specific spacing around headings (like a newline before a heading), and without strict adherence to these rules, determining the start of a section could be challenging.\n- **Links/Images Syntax**: Identifying the actual text versus links or image alt text could be tricky if the syntax is not standard.\n- **Nested Content**: If sections contain nested lists or code blocks, it might be difficult to determine where the section ends without clear demarcation.\n- **Custom Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown files may use non-standard extensions or custom Markdown rendering that standard parsers do not recognize.\n\nWithout seeing the input file yet, these are some potential issues that might arise during the parsing process.
