An inconsistent use of these can make it difficult to parse the structure.\n\n4. **Linked Content:** If the subsection contains links, images, or other embedded content, it may require additional processing to extract just the text or to handle the linked content appropriately.\n\n5. **Text with Special Characters:** Special characters in Markdown, like asterisks (*) for bold or italics, underscores (_), or backticks (`) for code, need to be preserved in the excerpt as they are part of the Markdown formatting.\n\n6. **Size of Content:** The subsection may contain a large amount of text, making it cumbersome to extract and present all the relevant information accurately.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues:** If the file uses a specific encoding that doesn't match the parser's expected encoding, characters might not render correctly.\n\n8. **Identification of Heading Levels:** Correctly identifying the hierarchy of headings and subheadings is crucial to determine which is the \"1th subsection under 1th section.\"\n\nOnce the input file is available, these potential difficulties can be addressed more precisely."
