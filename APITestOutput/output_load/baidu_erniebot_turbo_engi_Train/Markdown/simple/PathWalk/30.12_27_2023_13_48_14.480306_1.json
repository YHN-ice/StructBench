For example, headers can be indicated with `#`, `##`, etc., or underlined with `=` or `-` for different levels.\n\n2. **Nested Structure**: The hierarchical structure might be complex with multiple levels of nesting. Identifying the correct level of subsection and its parent section requires careful parsing.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Some markdown files may not consistently use the same level of headers for sections and subsections or may have formatting errors.\n\n4. **Link References**: Sections or subsections might contain links, which could be inline or reference style, possibly complicating the extraction of pure text content.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML/Code Blocks**: Markdown can include HTML tags or fenced code blocks which might need to be handled differently than regular markdown text.\n\n6. **Lists, Blockquotes, and Other Elements**: Subsections may contain lists (ordered or unordered), blockquotes, images, or other elements that have their own syntax that needs to be respected.\n\n7. **Text Emphasis**: Italics, bold, and strike-through text will have markdown symbols that might need to be considered when extracting plain text.\n\n8. **Identification of Section/Subsection Boundaries**: Determining the end of a subsection may be challenging if there is no clear delimiter, especially if the content continues with a paragraph that doesn't start with a header symbol.\n\nTo give an accurate answer, the parser must handle these issues correctly and identify the appropriate content based on the structure of the markdown file provided."
