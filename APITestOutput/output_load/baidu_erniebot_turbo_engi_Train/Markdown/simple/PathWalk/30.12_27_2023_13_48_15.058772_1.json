Normally, we would expect \"1st\" for the first item. Ensuring clarity on this reference is important for accurate parsing.\n\n6. **Additional Markdown Elements**: The presence of other Markdown elements like lists, code blocks, blockquotes, or links within the section could complicate extraction of just the text content.\n\n7. **Content Spanning Multiple Lines**: If the content of the subsection spans multiple lines or paragraphs, the parser must be capable of capturing the entire content without cutting it off prematurely.\n\n8. **External References**: If there are any external references (e.g., images or links) within the subsection that are vital to understanding the content, it might be necessary to also consider how to handle these references.\n\n9. **File Encoding and Character Set**: The file's encoding could impact how text is read and interpreted, especially if special characters are involved.\n\n10. **File Size and Memory Constraints**: If the Markdown file is very large, memory constraints might affect the ability to parse and process the file in its entirety.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, clear rules for parsing headings and content must be established, and the parser should be able to handle various formatting and structural nuances of Markdown files."
