Determining the correct subsection requires understanding the hierarchy of headings.\n\n2. **Heading Formats**: Headings in Markdown can be formatted in different ways (using `#`, `##`, `###`, etc., or underlined with `=` or `-` for first and second-level headers) and understanding these formats is crucial to identify the correct section and subsection.\n\n3. **List Handling**: Sections and subsections might be organized using lists. Correctly parsing lists, including nested lists, is necessary to extract the relevant content.\n\n4. **Code Blocks and Quotations**: Code blocks or quotations might be present and should not be confused with regular text content.\n\n5. **Links and Images**: Extracting text that might contain links or images requires parsing the Markdown syntax to ignore or process the URLs and alt text appropriately.\n\n6. **Inline Formatting**: Inline formatting like bold, italic, or strikethrough can add complexity to text extraction.\n\n7. **Tables**: Markdown tables need to be handled appropriately to extract content within them if they are part of the subsection content.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Identification**: Sometimes Markdown files do not have clear section delimiters, making it difficult to programmatically determine where a section starts and ends.\n\n9. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Authors might not consistently use Markdown formatting, leading to difficulties in correctly parsing sections and subsections.\n\n10. **External References**: The Markdown file might include references to external resources, which could be relevant if the content is not self-contained.\n\n11. **Metadata or Frontmatter**: Some Markdown files include metadata or frontmatter at the beginning of the file that should not be confused with the main content.\n\nBefore proceeding, it would be important to have a clear definition of what constitutes a \"section\" and \"subsection\" in this context, including any specific rules for identifying them within the Markdown structure provided."
