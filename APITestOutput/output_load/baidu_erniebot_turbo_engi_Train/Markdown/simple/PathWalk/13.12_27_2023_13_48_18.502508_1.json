Sections can be indicated using heading levels (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.), which means the parser must recognize different heading levels and determine which headings delineate the start and end of a section.\n\n2. **Nested Sections**: Markdown allows for nested sections, where a section may have sub-sections denoted by subsequent, deeper heading levels. Extracting only the content of the primary section without including sub-sections requires distinguishing between main headings and sub-headings.\n\n3. **Formatting Variations**: The format of headings can vary (e.g., underlines for certain headings, spaces after `#`, etc.), and the parser must accommodate these variations to identify section starts correctly.\n\n4. **Link References and Images**: Markdown syntax for links and images may include reference-style links or inline links, which can appear as part of the section content. Parsing these correctly without altering their formatting can be tricky.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Lists**: If the section contains code blocks or lists, these must be handled properly, ensuring indentation and line breaks are preserved to maintain readability and structure.\n\n6. **In-line Text Formatting**: Recognizing and preserving in-line text formatting (e.g., *italic*, **bold**, `code`) is necessary to keep the content's original intent and emphasis.\n\n7. **Handling HTML**: Some Markdown files might contain inline HTML for additional styling or structure, which needs to be preserved in the output.\n\n8. **Lazy Continuation**: In some cases, content might be split across lines without proper Markdown continuation, which might require interpretation or reformatting for correct display.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can confirm which of these potential difficulties apply and devise the right approach to accurately parse and extract the content from the first section."
