In Markdown, bold text can be created using double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` before and after the text. For example, `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`. \n\nSome potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of extracting bold text include:\n\n1. **Nested formatting:** Bold text might contain other Markdown formatting within it, such as italics, code, or links. We need to ensure only the bold text is extracted, not the additional formatting markers.\n   \n2. **Incomplete markers:** Sometimes, the bold markers might not be correctly paired, which means they wouldn't denote bold text according to the Markdown specifications. For instance, `**bold text*` is incorrect and should not be considered bold.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Markdown allows escaping of special characters using the backslash `\\`. So if a user wants to display asterisks without making the text bold, they might use `\\**not bold**`. Identifying and handling escaped characters is necessary to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Different markers for bold:** As mentioned earlier, both double asterisks and double underscores can be used for bolding text in Markdown. The parser needs to recognize both.\n\n5. **Line breaks:** Bold text may span multiple lines, and depending on how strict the implementation of Markdown is, this could present complications.\n\n6. **Text in code blocks or inline code:** Bold syntax inside code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or four spaces indent) or inline code (indicated by single backticks `) should not be treated as bold since they are meant to represent code.\n\n7. **Literal asterisks or underscores:** Asterisks and underscores might appear in the text literally, for example in mathematical expressions or as bullet points in lists, and these should not be confused with bold markers.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a robust Markdown parser would need to handle various edge cases and ambiguously formatted text. It would need to clearly define the rules it uses to identify bold text and apply those rules consistently across the input file."
