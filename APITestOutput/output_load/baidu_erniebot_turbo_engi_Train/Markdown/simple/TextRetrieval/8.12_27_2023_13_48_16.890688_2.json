However, there might be variations or errors like missing alt text, missing title, etc.\n   - Inline HTML image tags (e.g., `<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"description\" />`) might be used instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths:**\n   - Images can be linked with either relative or absolute paths. Relative paths might have different base paths depending on where the Markdown file is located.\n   - Absolute URLs to images that are hosted online would need to be identified as such.\n\n3. **Reference-style image links:**\n   - Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but is instead referenced at the bottom of the document (or somewhere else). This could make extraction more challenging.\n   \n4. **Images linked within text:**\n   - Sometimes an image link might be part of a larger line of text or paragraph, possibly nested within other Markdown elements like links.\n\n5. **Escaping characters:**\n   - File names or paths might contain characters that are escaped within Markdown, and they would need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n6. **File extensions:**\n   - Not all images may have standard image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). Some might have unconventional or custom file extensions that might not be recognized easily.\n\n7. **Comments and false positives:**\n   - Markdown does not officially support comments, but HTML comments can be included and might contain image-like syntax that isn't meant to be an actual image reference.\n   - Text that resembles an image link but isn't one could lead to false positives.\n\nAfter considering these potential issues, you can provide the input file so that the actual extraction process can begin, keeping these potential obstacles in mind."
