When parsing a Markdown file to extract image files, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Variations in Markdown Image Syntax**: The standard syntax for images in Markdown is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there could be variations or errors in the syntax that need to be handled gracefully.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The image URLs could be absolute URLs (pointing to an external resource) or relative paths (pointing to a file within the same repository or project). Extracting file names from absolute URLs may require additional parsing.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown supports embedding raw HTML. Images could be included using `<img>` tags instead of the standard Markdown syntax, which would require parsing HTML within the Markdown file.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style links and images, where the URL or path is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document. This would necessitate keeping track of the reference definitions and matching them with the image identifiers.\n\n5. **Image Links**: Sometimes, images are also links; this means they are nested within a link syntax. The parser must differentiate between the image and the link surrounding it.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: There might be escaped characters that need to be correctly interpreted, especially if the image filename contains special characters.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on the Same Line**: Handling multiple images on a single line might require careful parsing to ensure that all image paths are captured.\n\n8. **Comments**: Markdown does not natively support comments, but HTML comments might be present and could include image-like syntax that should not be processed as actual images.\n\n9. **Code Blocks**: Image-like syntax within code blocks or inline code (using backticks) should not be treated as actual images since they are meant to display as code.\n\nOnce we identify these challenges, we can proceed to parse the input file with these considerations in mind. Please provide the Markdown file content so we can extract the image filenames."
