Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Multiple Formatting Styles:** In Markdown, bold text can be created using double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` before and after the text. A parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might contain other formatted text like italics, which could either use asterisks `*` or underscores `_`. The parser must differentiate between the nested formatting and not confuse it with the bold markers.\n\n3. **Incomplete Markers:** Sometimes, a Markdown file might have unmatched or incorrectly placed bold markers, which could lead to parsing errors if not handled properly.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters:** If the asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash (`\\`), they are not meant to denote bold text but are literal characters that should be included in the output.\n\n5. **Inline Code Blocks:** Text within inline code blocks using backticks ``` should not be parsed as bold, even if it contains bold markers.\n\n6. **Link Descriptions:** Text within link descriptions might also contain bold markers, and depending on the context, these may or may not be intended as bold text.\n\n7. **Whitespaces and Line Breaks:** Whitespace characters and line breaks around the bold markers might affect how they are interpreted by different Markdown parsers.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Syntax:** Sometimes, the syntax might be ambiguous, for example with overlapping formatting markers, making it difficult to determine the intended formatting.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, a robust Markdown parser needs to account for various edge cases to accurately extract all bold texts. Now we'll need the input Markdown file to proceed with the actual parsing."
