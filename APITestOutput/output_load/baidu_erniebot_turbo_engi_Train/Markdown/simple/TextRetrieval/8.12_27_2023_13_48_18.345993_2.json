Handling both types necessitates different parsing strategies.\n\n2. **Variety of Image File Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. The parser must be able to recognize all common image formats.\n\n3. **Images Hosted on External Servers**: Some images may not be stored locally but are linked to external URLs. The parser should differentiate between local file paths and URLs.\n\n4. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images can be nested within other elements, like lists or blockquotes, which can make the parsing process more complex.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Other parts of the text might resemble the syntax used for images, such as links to web pages that are not images, or other in-line elements enclosed in parentheses and brackets.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the syntax for images could be escaped to display the literal characters rather than rendering an image. The parser should handle escaped characters appropriately.\n\n7. **Title Attributes**: The optional title attribute in the image syntax could include spaces and special characters, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. **Alt Text Consideration**: The parser needs to ignore the alternative text (alt text) and only focus on the image paths or URLs.\n\n9. **Markdown Variants**: There are different flavors of Markdown, like GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) or CommonMark, which might have slight differences in how images are included.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: The file encoding (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.) could potentially cause issues if not handled correctly, especially with non-ASCII characters in image filenames or paths.\n\nThese challenges must be addressed by the parser algorithm to ensure accurate extraction of all image filenames from the Markdown content."
