We need to ensure that we extract only the bold portion of the text and handle any nested formatting correctly.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax may include escaped characters such as `\\**` or `\\__`, which are meant to display the asterisk or underscore characters rather than to apply formatting. We need to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Usage**: Some users may not consistently use double asterisks or double underscores for bold text, mixing them or not properly closing them, which could lead to difficulties in parsing.\n\n4. **Different Dialects of Markdown**: There are various dialects and implementations of Markdown (such as GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and they may have slightly different rules for parsing bold text. It's necessary to know which dialect the input follows.\n\n5. **Incomplete Tags**: If the bold tags are not correctly paired (an opening `**` without a closing `**`), it may result in incorrect extraction or missing text.\n\n6. **Text Across Multiple Lines**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser must be able to handle multi-line bold text.\n\n7. **Variations in Line Breaks**: Different operating systems use different characters for line breaks (e.g., `\\n`, `\\r\\n`), and this could affect how the text is parsed.\n\n8. **Links and Images**: Links and images might also be formatted to be bold, and their syntax could interfere with simple pattern matching.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parser must be robust enough to handle the complexity of Markdown formatting and consider the context to accurately extract the bold text without including any unwanted characters or formatting marks."
