Common difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process include:\n\n1. Different image syntax: Markdown allows embedding images with a syntax like `![alt text](image_url)`. It's essential to handle both inline and reference image styles.\n\n2. Variations in image URLs: The image URL could be a relative path, an absolute path, or a full URL. It may also include query parameters or anchors.\n\n3. Nested content: An image link could be nested within other elements, such as a list or a blockquote, which might make the regex used for extraction more complicated.\n\n4. Alternative text: Handling the alt text is not strictly necessary for extracting the image file name, but it can appear within the `![ ]` brackets and should be correctly ignored when extracting the file name.\n\n5. Link references: In Markdown, you can define a reference for URLs and use that reference throughout the document. This means that the actual URL of the image may not be immediately after the `![]` but could instead be a reference to a URL defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. File extensions: We need to consider various image file extensions such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., and ensure that these are included in the parsing logic.\n\n7. Escaped characters: Sometimes, characters in Markdown are escaped with a backslash, `\\`, which might affect how URLs are parsed.\n\n8. Non-image links: It's important to distinguish between image links and non-image links (which may have a similar syntax) to avoid false positives.\n\nTo overcome these potential obstacles, we'd need to appropriately design our parsing logic or regex to account for these variations and ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
