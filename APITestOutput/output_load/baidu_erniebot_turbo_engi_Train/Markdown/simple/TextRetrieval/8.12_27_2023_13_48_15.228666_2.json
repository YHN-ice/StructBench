Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. **Markdown Syntax Variations**: The syntax for embedding images in Markdown can vary, with the most common being `![Alt text](URL)` where \"URL\" is the location of the image. However, variations may include additional attributes such as title, dimensions, or even inline HTML.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be either relative to the location of the Markdown file or absolute URLs. We need to handle both scenarios when extracting file names.\n\n3. **Markdown Flavors**: Different implementations of Markdown may have slight variations in syntax, which could affect how images are embedded and thus how they should be parsed.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes images are embedded using raw HTML tags within a Markdown file. This can complicate the parsing as we have to look for `<img>` tags in addition to Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Reference-Style Links**: Image links can be in reference style, where the URL is not inline with the image tag but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, characters within the Markdown syntax might be escaped, which would need to be accounted for when parsing.\n\n7. **Textual Noise**: Additional text or characters that are not part of the Markdown syntax for images could be present and need to be filtered out.\n\n8. **Image Titles and Alt Text**: Alt text and titles for images, which are part of the Markdown syntax, should not be mistaken for parts of the file name.\n\n9. **File Name Extraction**: Once the URL or path to an image is identified, it might still require additional processing to extract just the file name, especially if it's a URL with query parameters or fragments.\n\n10. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: If multiple images are placed on a single line, each one needs to be identified and processed separately.\n\n11. **Markdown Inside Code Blocks**: Images within code blocks or inline code should not be treated as actual image references but rather as code examples.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful consideration while implementing the parsing logic to ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
