For the most part, images are included using the syntax `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. However, there may be variations or extensions that include images differently.\n\n2. **Image Reference Links:** Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not included inline with the image syntax but is instead referenced at another point in the document. This means that to extract the file name, you would have to resolve this reference.\n\n3. **Images Included as HTML:** Sometimes Markdown files include raw HTML for more complex formatting, and images can be included this way using `<img>` tags.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths:** Images can be included with absolute URLs, which point to an external resource, or relative paths which point to a file within the same directory structure as the Markdown file. Only relative paths should be considered for extracting file names.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs:** Sometimes the URLs can be percent-encoded (especially when they contain spaces or other special characters), which can add complexity to extracting the plain file name.\n\n6. **Unusual File Extensions:** While we might expect certain image file extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., there could be less common extensions or even no extension at all if the image is dynamically generated by a script.\n\n7. **Other Non-image Files:** Ensuring that only image files are extracted requires either checking the file extension or the context in which the link appears to confirm it is indeed an image.\n\n8. **Escape Characters:** Markdown syntax allows for escape characters to prevent certain characters from being interpreted as Markdown, which could affect parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n9. **Incorrect Syntax:** If the Markdown file contains errors or non-standard syntax, these could lead to misinterpretation of image file names.\n\nThese potential difficulties would need to be accounted for when designing a Markdown parser or writing a script to extract image file names from a Markdown document."
