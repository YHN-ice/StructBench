Commonly, Markdown uses double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__) to denote bold text. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Formatting**: The use of asterisks or underscores for bold text might not be consistent throughout the Markdown file. Some users might mix these or not properly close the formatting delimiters.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can have nested formatting, like italic or strikethrough inside it, which can complicate the extraction process. Handling nested formatting requires additional parsing logic.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes users escape the formatting characters (like \\**) to display them as literals rather than formatting the text. Distinguishing between actual formatting and escaped characters is necessary.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are also used for other purposes, like bulleted lists, italic text (single asterisk or underscore), and sometimes in code blocks or inline code snippets where they shouldn't be interpreted as formatting.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and a simplistic parser might fail to recognize the multiline formatting if it only searches line by line.\n\n6. **Link Descriptions**: Asterisks or underscores within link descriptions should not be mistaken for bold formatting.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, the parser must account for these potential issues and implement logic to handle each case properly. Now we can proceed to view the input file and begin extracting the bold text."
