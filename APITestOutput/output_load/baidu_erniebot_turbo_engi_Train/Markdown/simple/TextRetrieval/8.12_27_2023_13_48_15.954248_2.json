It's necessary to identify which part of the syntax represents the actual file name.\n\n3. **Alt text confusion**: The alt text, which appears in square brackets `[]`, could have characters that make it difficult to distinguish from the actual file name or URL.\n\n4. **Link versus image**: Markdown also uses similar syntax for links and images. The difference is an exclamation mark `!` before the first square bracket for images. Care must be taken not to confuse these two.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain HTML tags, so it's possible that an image is included using an `<img>` tag instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Nested content**: Sometimes there might be nested parentheses or brackets which can complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. **Escaped characters**: Characters in Markdown such as brackets and parentheses might be escaped with backslashes, which could affect the parsing logic.\n\nConsidering these potential issues, when proceeding to extract image file names from a Markdown file, one must carefully parse the content, understanding and distinguishing between the various ways images can be included within the file."
