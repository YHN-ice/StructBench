The parser must handle all these syntaxes correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold text in Markdown might contain other elements such as links `[**bold link**](url)`, italics, or even code spans. The parser should ideally extract only the bold text while handling or ignoring the nested elements appropriately.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** If asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash in the file (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), they should not be treated as bold syntax. The parser needs to recognize escaped characters properly.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting:** Sometimes Markdown may have incorrect formatting (like unbalanced asterisks `**bold*`) which technically should not render as bold but may still be intended to be bold by the author. Deciding how to handle such cases could be challenging.\n\n5. **Inline Bold Texts:** Bold text might appear inline with other text, and extracting it without capturing surrounding characters can be tricky.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks (indented with four spaces or surrounded by triple backticks ```) and inline code (surrounded by single backticks) should not be parsed for Markdown formatting, including bold.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be designed to accurately recognize and extract bold text while dealing with these complexities. Now I'm ready to see the input file and start extracting the bold texts as requested."
