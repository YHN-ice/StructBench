Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Markdown Syntax Variations**: There are multiple ways to embed images in Markdown, such as using the standard `![alt text](image-path)` syntax or using HTML tags like `<img src=\"image-path\">`. The parser must handle all such variations.\n\n2. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows for images to be included using reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax, but instead referenced at another place in the document.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths in Markdown can be either relative to the document or absolute URLs to external resources. While extracting filenames, the parser should differentiate between these and handle them appropriately.\n\n4. **Multiple Images on One Line**: Sometimes, a markdown file may include multiple images on a single line. The parser needs to identify and extract each one separately.\n\n5. **Non-image Links**: In Markdown, the syntax for embedding images is similar to that for linking text. The parser must distinguish between the two.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: The Markdown syntax might include escape characters that could affect how text is parsed (e.g., an exclamation mark could be escaped to prevent it from being treated as an image).\n\n7. **Nested Markup**: Images may be nested inside other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which could complicate the parsing logic.\n\n8. **False Positives**: Text that looks like image syntax but isn't (e.g., commented-out image links, or image-like patterns within code blocks) should not be extracted as images.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing algorithm or regular expression pattern that takes into consideration all of these factors will be necessary to accurately identify and extract only the included image files from the Markdown content."
