We need to extract only the bold portion without the nested elements.\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores might be escaped within the text, which means they are not used for bold formatting. For example, `\\**not bold\\**` should not be considered as bold.\n4. **False Positives**: Partial syntax or incorrect usage should not be confused with bold formatting. For instance, `**bold*` is incorrect and should not be considered bold.\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text could span multiple lines, which needs to be handled correctly.\n6. **Overlapping Formatting**: There may be instances where bold formatting overlaps with other formatting (like italics), creating complex cases, such as `***bold and italic***`.\n\nThe parser will need to account for these potential issues and accurately return all the texts that are correctly formatted as bold within the Markdown file."
