I'll need to recognize and handle both types.\n\n2. **Variety of Image File Extensions**: Image files come with various extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. I should be ready to identify and extract various image file types.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute URLs**: Images might be linked using relative paths or absolute URLs. While extracting filenames, I must differentiate between a web URL and an actual file name within the Markdown content.\n\n4. **Alternate Text and Titles**: The syntax for embedding images often includes alternate text and optional titles, which I need to ignore while extracting just the file names.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters or Markdown Characters in File Names**: The file names might contain escaped characters or characters that are meaningful in Markdown (e.g., underscores or asterisks), which could affect parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n6. **Images Embedded in HTML**: Sometimes images are embedded using raw HTML tags inside Markdown documents. This requires parsing HTML within Markdown to find image sources.\n\n7. **Links Without Images**: There might be links in the Markdown which are not images. It's important not to confuse them with image links.\n\n8. **Formatting Errors**: The Markdown might have formatting errors where the image syntax is incorrect, making it harder to identify image links reliably.\n\nWith these potential issues in mind, I'm ready to process the input and extract the image filenames. Please provide the Markdown content so we can begin."
