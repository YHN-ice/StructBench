When parsing a Markdown file to extract image file names, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Variety of Image Syntax**: Markdown supports different ways to include images, the most common being `![Alt text](URL)` and reference-style links. A parser should handle both inline and reference image syntaxes.\n\n2. **Complex URLs**: Image URLs might contain parentheses, query parameters, or anchors which can complicate the parsing. The parser must correctly identify the end of the URL.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, characters like parentheses or brackets might be escaped within the Markdown, which would require special handling to correctly parse the URLs.\n\n4. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images may be nested within other elements like links or lists, which could potentially confuse a simple parsing algorithm.\n\n5. **Reference Definitions Spread Across Lines**: In the case of reference-style image links, the definition of the URL might be on a separate line from the image reference itself.\n\n6. **Alt Text Complexity**: The alt text for images might contain characters that could be mistaken for Markdown syntax, such as square or round brackets.\n\n7. **Non-image Files**: Ensuring that the extracted files are indeed images and not links to non-image files requires checking the file extension or content type if available.\n\n8. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked with relative paths that might require resolution based on the location of the Markdown file, or they may be absolute URLs which are complete as-is.\n\n9. **Markdown Variants**: Different Markdown processors might have slight variations in how they handle image embedding, so the parser should ideally be flexible enough to handle these variants.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a robust Markdown parser would need to have a well-thought-out regular expression or a parsing strategy that can handle these edge cases and accurately extract image file names from a variety of Markdown content."
