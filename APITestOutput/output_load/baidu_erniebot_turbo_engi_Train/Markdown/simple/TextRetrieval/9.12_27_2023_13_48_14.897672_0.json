The most common ones are double asterisks `**bold**` or double underscores `__bold__`. We must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting markers such as italics, links, or strikethroughs. Parsing needs to be context-aware to handle such cases correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash to display them as literals instead of using them for formatting. For example, `\\**not bold**` should not be treated as bold text.\n\n4. **Line Breaks within Bold Text**: If there are line breaks in the middle of bold text, they need to be handled properly to ensure the whole text is extracted as one piece.\n\n5. **Incorrect Markdown Formatting**: Some texts might appear to be bold due to incorrect Markdown formatting (like missing one asterisk in a pair). Deciding whether to consider these as bold could be subjective.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text inside code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented with four spaces) or inline code (surrounded by single backticks `) should not be treated as formatted text even if it contains bold markers.\n\n7. **Link Texts**: The description part of the link syntax could contain bold text. We need to parse it correctly while ignoring the link itself.\n\nOnce we start parsing the actual input file, we might encounter these or other unexpected formatting issues that need to be addressed in order to extract all the bold texts accurately."
