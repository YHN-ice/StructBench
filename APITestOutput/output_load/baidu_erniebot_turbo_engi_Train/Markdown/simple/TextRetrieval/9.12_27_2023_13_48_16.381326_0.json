I would need to ensure that nested formatting doesn't affect the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Asterisks or underscores within the text might be escaped, meaning they're part of the text and not Markdown formatting. These should not be interpreted as bold markers.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: There could be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\n5. **Cross-Paragraph Bold**: Sometimes bold markers might start in one paragraph and end in another by mistake, which could complicate parsing.\n\n6. **False Positives**: There may be instances where asterisks or underscores are used in contexts other than bolding (like bullet points or horizontal rules), which should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle multiline scenarios.\n\n8. **Compatibility Issues**: The parser must consider potential variations in Markdown flavors since some implementations might have slight differences.\n\n9. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is very large, the parser must efficiently handle the text without significant performance degradation.\n\n10. **Ambiguity in Specification**: Since Markdown doesn't have a strict specification, different tools might interpret the syntax slightly differently, introducing ambiguity in parsing.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful consideration of the Markdown syntax and possibly using regular expressions or a parsing library that can handle various edge cases.
