I need to account for both possibilities.\n\n2. **Relative and absolute URLs**: Image URLs could be either relative (pointing to a location within the same repository or file system) or absolute (pointing to a location on the web). I should identify the file names regardless of the URL type.\n\n3. **Reference-style links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but instead is referenced at another place in the document. I'll need to parse these references too if they exist.\n\n4. **Variations in URL formats**: The URL might include query parameters or fragments which are not part of the file name.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: Some URLs may include encoded characters that need to be decoded to get the actual file name.\n\n6. **Image files inside code blocks**: Sometimes image links could be placed inside code blocks for demonstration purposes. These shouldn't typically be considered as included images because they're not meant to be displayed as part of the Markdown content.\n\n7. **Markdown extensions and flavors**: Different Markdown processors may support additional syntax or have minor differences in how they handle image embedding, which could affect parsing.\n\n8. **File extensions**: To properly identify image files, I'll need to recognize common image file extensions like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.\n\n9. **Mistakes in Markdown**: There could be errors in the Markdown file, such as missing parentheses or brackets, which could make it harder to correctly parse image references.\n\n10. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax might be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted, which could affect how the text is parsed.\n\nUnderstanding these difficulties will help in writing a robust parser that can correctly identify and extract all included image files from the Markdown content provided."
