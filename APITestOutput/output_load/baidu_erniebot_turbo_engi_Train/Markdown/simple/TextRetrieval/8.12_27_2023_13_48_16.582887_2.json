The most common is `![Alt text](URL)` or `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`. However, variations or errors in the syntax could lead to difficulties in correctly identifying image links.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image file paths can be either relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs. Extracting only file names might require additional logic to handle different path types.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also include raw HTML. Images could be embedded using HTML `img` tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also supports reference-style links and images, where the URL is provided elsewhere in the document, which requires keeping track of references throughout the document.\n\n5. **Links within Code Blocks**: Links to images might be included within code blocks or inline code segments, which shouldn't be treated as actual images to extract.\n\n6. **Non-Image File URLs**: Not all URLs will point to image files. The parser must discern between image file URLs and other types of URLs.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Image syntax might include escaped characters that need to be handled correctly, such as an escaped parenthesis or brackets.\n\n8. **Variations in File Extensions**: Image files can have various extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser must recognize all possible valid image file extensions.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes, adding complexity to the parsing process.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful consideration when writing or using a Markdown parser to ensure accurate extraction of image file names from a document."
