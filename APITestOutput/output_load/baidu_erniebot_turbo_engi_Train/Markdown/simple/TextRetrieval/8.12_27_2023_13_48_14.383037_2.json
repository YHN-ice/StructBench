An image link will have an exclamation mark (`!`) before the square brackets.\n\n3. **File Paths**: Images can be linked with relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs. Extracting file names requires distinguishing these cases and handling each appropriately.\n\n4. **Title and Alt Text**: The alt text or title of an image can sometimes contain file-like strings or parentheses, which could lead to false positives if not correctly parsed.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Markdown allows for escape characters to include literal characters which would otherwise serve as Markdown syntax. This could affect the parsing of image file names.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown**: Sometimes Markdown is nested within other elements, like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which might add complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Different flavors of Markdown might include non-standard extensions that provide additional ways to embed images.\n\nGiven these potential issues, care must be taken to ensure the parser can handle all these cases and accurately extract only the intended image file names."
