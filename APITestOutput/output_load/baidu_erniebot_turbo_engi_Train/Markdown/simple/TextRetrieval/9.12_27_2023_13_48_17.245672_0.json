There are a few potential challenges that might arise:\n\n1. **Different Bold Syntaxes**: Markdown can use different syntaxes to denote bold text, typically `**text**` or `__text__`. The parser must be able to handle both.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements inside it, like links `[link](url)`, code `code`, or even other bold or italic markers. The parser must be able to extract the bold text without being confused by nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: If the Markdown contains escaped bold syntax (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), the parser must not mistakenly extract it as bold text.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: In some cases, there might be incomplete markers for bold text (e.g., `**text`). The parser needs to decide whether to consider this as bold or not based on the context or rules defined.\n\n5. **Inline vs Block**: Bold text can be inline with other text or on its own line. The parser needs to handle both scenarios.\n\n6. **Whitespace and Newline Handling**: There might be whitespace or newline characters around the bold markers that need to be handled appropriately.\n\n7. **Multiple Bold Sections on a Single Line**: There may be multiple bold sections within a single line, and the parser needs to extract each of them separately.\n\n8. **Overlapping Italics and Bold**: Since asterisks are also used for italic text (single asterisk or underscore), the parser must distinguish between overlapping usage (e.g., `***bold and italic***` should only return `bold and italic` as bold).\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll apply the necessary logic to extract the bold texts while addressing these potential challenges as needed."
