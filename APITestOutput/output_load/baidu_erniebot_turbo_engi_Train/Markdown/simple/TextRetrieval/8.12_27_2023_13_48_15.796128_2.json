For instance, the most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`. But there might be variations, such as:\n   - Without alt text: `![](URL)`\n   - Without title text: `![Alt text](URL)`\n   - Reference-style images: `![Alt text][id]` followed by `[id]: URL \"Title\"`\n   - Inline HTML with `<img>` tags.\n\n2. **Image URLs vs File Names**: Images in Markdown can link to web URLs or to local files. We'll need to distinguish between the two and only extract the local file names.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths could be relative to the Markdown file or absolute paths on the file system. In this case, we should only extract the file name part of the path.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: Some image URLs might be URL-encoded (percent encoding), which could make it harder to extract clean file names.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: If special characters in Markdown are escaped (such as `\\![Alt text](URL)`), these images might be intended not to be displayed as images. Identification of such cases might be necessary.\n\n6. **Embedded Images**: Images encoded in Base64 or other data formats embedded directly in the Markdown could potentially be mistaken for image files.\n\n7. **External Resources with Similar Syntax**: Sometimes, links to external resources such as videos might resemble image syntax but aren't actual image files.\n\n8. **Linked Images**: Sometimes, images are linked to a larger version of themselves or to some other URL. The parser needs to be able to differentiate between the image URL and the link URL.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, the parser will need to be carefully designed to account for various Markdown image syntaxes and edge cases while ensuring that only the names of included image files are extracted."
