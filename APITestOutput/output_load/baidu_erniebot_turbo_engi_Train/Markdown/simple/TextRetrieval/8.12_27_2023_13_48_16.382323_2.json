The standard syntax is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but there could be variations or shortcuts used in different Markdown processors.\n\n2. **Reference Style Images**: Images can also be included using reference-style links, where the URL and title are defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Sometimes images might be embedded using inline HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax. A parser would need to recognize `<img>` tags and their attributes.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image sources can be relative or absolute paths. Identifying the filenames may require different handling for these cases.\n\n5. **Link Definitions Inside Code Blocks or Quotes**: Link definitions for images that appear inside code blocks or quotes should not be processed as images.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax might contain escaped characters that need to be properly interpreted or ignored when extracting image file names.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Sometimes images might be nested within other elements, like lists or tables, which could complicate the parsing rules.\n\n8. **Invalid or Broken Image Syntax**: The Markdown file might contain errors or non-standard syntax, which can lead to misinterpretation of image file names.\n\n9. **Different File Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser should be flexible enough to recognize them all.\n\n10. **File Names with Spaces or Special Characters**: Some filenames might contain spaces or special characters that are encoded differently in URLs, and handling them correctly can be challenging.\n\nWithout seeing the input file, it's important to design the parser with these potential issues in mind to ensure it can robustly handle a wide variety of Markdown content and accurately extract all image file names."
