The parser must be able to handle all variations.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: There might be escaped asterisks or underscores that should not be treated as Markdown syntax. For instance, `\\**not bold**` should not be considered bold.\n\n3. **Nested Elements**: Bold text could have nested elements like italic, strikethrough, or inline code. The parser needs to decide whether it should extract the bold text as it is or remove the nested formatting.\n\n4. **Incorrect Syntax**: If the Markdown syntax is not correctly applied (e.g., missing a closing asterisk), it can lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n5. **Links or Images**: There may be links or images with alternative text that uses bold syntax. The parser must distinguish between actual bold text and bold syntax used in link/image descriptions.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks or inline code should not be processed as Markdown formatting, including bold.\n\n7. **Mixed Formatting**: Some Markdown processors allow for mixed formatting, such as bold and italic together. This can complicate extraction when the syntax overlaps.\n\n8. **Line Breaks**: Line breaks within bold text could affect the parsing depending on how the Markdown processor handles them.\n\nTo accurately answer your question, I would need to parse the actual Markdown content while considering these potential difficulties. Please provide the input file, and I will do my best to extract all bold texts as per your request."
