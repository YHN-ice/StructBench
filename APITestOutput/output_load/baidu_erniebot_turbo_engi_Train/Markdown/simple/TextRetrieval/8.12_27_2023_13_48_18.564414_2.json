The standard format is `![Alt text](URL)`, but it's possible to encounter variations or misuse of syntax that could complicate extraction.\n\n2. **Image references vs. inline images**: Markdown allows for images to be included directly with their URL or to be referenced at the bottom of the file. This means there may be two different patterns to search for.\n\n3. **Relative and absolute paths**: Images can be linked with relative paths (like `./image.png`) or absolute paths (like `http://example.com/image.png`). The parser must handle both types of paths correctly.\n\n4. **Images within links**: Sometimes an image is nested inside a hyperlink. This could potentially confuse the parser if it's not accounting for nested Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **Non-image URLs**: Not every URL in a Markdown file is an image URL. The parser needs to differentiate between image URLs and other types of links.\n\n6. **Escaped characters**: Some characters might be escaped inside the Markdown file, which could affect how URLs are parsed.\n\n7. **Text that looks like an image tag**: Sometimes, a user might include text that superficially looks like an image tag but isn't, such as in code blocks or quoted text.\n\n8. **File extensions**: We might need to consider only common image file extensions (such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) to avoid extracting non-image files that happen to follow a similar pattern.\n\n9. **Alternative text**: Image markdown could include alternative text which needs to be ignored while extracting the filename.\n\n10. **Handling errors**: The parser should gracefully handle cases where the Markdown is malformed.\n\nEach of these potential difficulties would need to be considered when extracting image filenames from the given Markdown input."
