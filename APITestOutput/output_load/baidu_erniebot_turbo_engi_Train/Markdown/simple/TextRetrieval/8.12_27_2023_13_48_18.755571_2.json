I have to be prepared for the most common syntaxes.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Sometimes, images in Markdown files are embedded using raw HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax. I would need to be able to parse HTML as well.\n\n3. **Linked Images**: Images might not be directly embedded but linked to. I need to differentiate between links to image files and other types of links.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be referenced via relative paths which might require context to resolve, or absolute paths which could be remote URLs or local.\n\n5. **Reference-style Links**: Markdown allows for the use of reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but rather placed elsewhere in the document.\n\n6. **Image Titles and Alt Text**: These are often included with image syntax, which adds complexity to parsing.\n\n7. **Formatting Consistency**: The consistency in formatting could be an issue if there are spaces, line breaks, or other characters that are not standard within the image syntax.\n\n8. **Non-image Files**: There might be links to non-image files that appear similar to image links (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`) that I should not extract.\n\n9. **Comments**: Markdown comments or HTML comments might contain image-like syntax that should not be treated as actual images to extract.\n\nAddressing these potential issues will require careful parsing and consideration of the Markdown file's structure and content."
