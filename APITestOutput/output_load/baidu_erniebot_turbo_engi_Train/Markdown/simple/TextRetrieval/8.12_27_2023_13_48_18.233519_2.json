The parser must handle both inline and reference image link styles.\n\n2. **URLs vs. File Paths:** The parser must discriminate between external image URLs (which may not be actual files included in the Markdown) and relative or absolute file paths that point to image files.\n\n3. **Image File Extensions:** It needs to recognize various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and possibly ignore non-image file extensions.\n\n4. **False Positives:** The parser should not be tricked by image-like syntax inside code blocks or inline code spans, where image syntax should be treated as plain text.\n\n5. **Link Titles**: Some images might include titles in quotes after the URL, which the parser should ignore while extracting the file names.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters:** The parser should handle escaped characters that could be part of the syntax or the file name itself.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown:** If there's markdown within alt text or other parts of the image syntax, the parser must still correctly identify the image files.\n\n8. **Invalid Markdown:** The parser might need to handle malformed Markdown in a graceful way, deciding whether to attempt recovery of partial information or to skip it entirely.\n\n9. **Multiple Images on One Line:** There might be multiple images within a single line, and the parser should extract all these image names separately.\n\n10. **Alt Text Complexity:** Alt text can sometimes be complex containing brackets or other characters that could confuse a simple parsing logic.\n\nAddressing these potential issues will require a robust parsing strategy that can discern and accurately extract image filenames from a variety of Markdown contexts and syntactic structures."
