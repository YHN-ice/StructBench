Markdown typically uses either double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` before and after a piece of text to make it bold.\n\nHere are some potential difficulties and obstacles in extracting all bold texts:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Syntax**: If the markdown file inconsistently uses the syntax for bold (e.g., mixing asterisks and underscores or using different numbers of them incorrectly), it might be difficult to accurately extract all bold texts.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, strikethroughs, or links. It can be challenging to separate the bold text from other formatting without losing context or inaccurately parsing the content.\n\n3. **Escaping Characters**: Asterisks and underscores can also be used in a non-formatting way in markdown, for example, `*\\*not bold\\**`, where the asterisks are escaped and the text is not actually bold.\n\n4. **Code Blocks**: If the bold markers are within code blocks (indicated by backticks), they should not be interpreted as formatting but rather as literal characters.\n\n5. **Links and Images**: The text inside of links or alt text for images might use bold syntax, which could be mistaken for regular bold text.\n\n6. **Incomplete Syntax**: If the file contains incomplete bold syntax, such as a missing closing asterisk or underscore, it could lead to incorrect parsing where non-bold text might be extracted as bold.\n\nTo accurately parse and extract bold text from a markdown file, we would need to carefully consider these potential issues and ensure that the parser is robust enough to handle them appropriately."
