In Markdown, bold text is typically indicated with double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` before and after the text. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Bold text should be surrounded by `**` or `__`, but there might be variations or mistakes in the formatting, such as uneven numbers of asterisks or underscores, spaces between markers and text, or mixing asterisks with underscores.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: The bold text might include other Markdown formatting elements like italics, which could be indicated with single asterisks `*` or single underscores `_`. This nested formatting adds complexity to the parsing process.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash `\\`, which means they should be treated as literal characters and not formatting markers. Differentiating between actual bold formatting and escaped characters would be necessary.\n\n4. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or indentation) and inline code (indicated by single backticks `) should not be treated as formatted text. Thus, detecting and ignoring bold syntax within these elements is crucial.\n\n5. **Links and Images**: Bold syntax within the alt text of links and images need to be handled correctly.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Markdown allows for line breaks within paragraphs, which might affect how bold text is detected if it spans multiple lines.\n\n7. **Special Cases**: There may be special cases where the Markdown syntax for bold is used in a context that doesn't actually indicate bold text. This requires additional logic to identify and handle these cases correctly.\n\nTo accurately extract bold text, a parser must handle all of these scenarios properly to avoid false positives or negatives. If any of these issues are present in the input file, they could complicate the extraction process."
