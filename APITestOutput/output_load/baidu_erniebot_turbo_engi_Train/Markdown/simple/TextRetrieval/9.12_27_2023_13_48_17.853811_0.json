            "content": "Sure, when parsing a Markdown file to extract bold texts, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Different Syntax for Bold:** Markdown supports multiple ways to bold text. The most common ways are to surround the text with double asterisks `**text**` or double underscores `__text__`. It's important to account for both methods.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text in Markdown can contain other formatting inside it, such as italic (`*text*` or `_text_`), strikethrough (`~~text~~`), or even inline code blocks (`` `code` ``). The parser would need to distinguish between nested formatting and the actual text that is intended to be bold.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Users can escape Markdown syntax characters using a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). The parser must recognize escaped characters and not treat them as formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers:** Sometimes, the bold markers might not be properly paired or closed (e.g., `**bold` or `bold**`). Deciding how to handle these cases can be challenging.\n\n5. **Line Breaks:** Text formatting can be disrupted by line breaks. Depending on the Markdown flavor, a line break might end the formatting or might be ignored.\n\n6. **Adjacent Formatting:** Bold text might be immediately followed or preceded by other formatting markers without any whitespace separation (e.g., `**bold****italic**`). The parser must correctly identify the boundaries of each formatting segment.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser needs to have a robust pattern-matching algorithm that can correctly identify valid bold formatting while accounting for all the aforementioned complexities."
