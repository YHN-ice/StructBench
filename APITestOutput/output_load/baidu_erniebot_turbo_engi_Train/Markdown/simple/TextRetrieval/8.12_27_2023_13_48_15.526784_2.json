Each of these methods has a distinct syntax, and a parser must handle all of them.\n\n2. **Link Confusion**: Distinguishing between image links and regular hyperlinks may be tricky since they have similar syntaxes. For images, the text is typically preceded by an exclamation mark (`!`), but care must be taken not to confuse them with hyperlinks, which do not have this marker.\n\n3. **File Name Extraction**: The parser needs to correctly extract just the file name from the complete image path or URL provided in the Markdown.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: If the Markdown contains escaped characters that are part of the image syntax, these have to be correctly interpreted during parsing.\n\n5. **Image File Extensions**: Recognizing all possible image file extensions is necessary to accurately extract image file names. Common extensions include `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, and `.svg`.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Sometimes, images may be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or block quotes, which adds complexity to the parsing process.\n\n7. **Alt Text Variation**: The alt text for images can vary significantly and may include special characters or even Markdown formatting itself, which needs to be handled properly without affecting the file name extraction.\n\n8. **Incorrect Markdown**: Dealing with incorrectly formatted Markdown (e.g., missing closing brackets or parentheses) can also pose a challenge to parsing accurately.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a Markdown file parser should implement a robust algorithm or set of regular expressions that can handle the various scenarios and extract image file names accurately."
