For example:\n   \n   ```html\n   <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"Optional title\" />\n   ```\n   \n   These would need to be accounted for separately from standard Markdown image syntax.\n3. **Reference-style Links:** Markdown also supports reference-style links, which might separate the URL of the image from the place where it's referenced.\n4. **Non-standard Characters in Filenames:** Filenames may contain spaces, special characters, or Unicode characters that might not be captured by a simple regular expression.\n5. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Image paths can be relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs, including external links to images hosted online, which technically aren't \"included\" files.\n6. **False Positives:** There could be instances where the image syntax is part of a code block or inline code, meaning it's not an actual image but rather an example of how to insert an image.\n7. **Text Following the Image Link:** Sometimes, there could be additional text on the same line after an image link which might interfere with correctly identifying the end of the image file path.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, a comprehensive solution would involve using regular expressions or a Markdown parsing library and handling each of these cases accordingly."
