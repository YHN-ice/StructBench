The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may have other formatting nested inside it, such as italic, strikethrough, or inline code. The parser needs to distinguish between the bold markers and other formatting markers.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores that are part of the text rather than formatting may be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold**`). The parser must recognize these and not treat them as bold formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be instances where the bold formatting is not correctly applied, such as missing one of the asterisks `*bold*` or mismatched syntax `**bold__`. The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Links and Images**: Markdown links and images may contain asterisks or underscores. The parser should not interpret these as bold formatting.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text in Markdown is typically inline, but there can be cases where the bold syntax spans multiple lines.\n\n7. **Literal Blocks**: Text within code blocks or indented by four spaces is typically treated as literal text, and any Markdown formatting within should not be interpreted. The parser must ignore such blocks.\n\n8. **Text Delimiters**: Bold text can be delimited by spaces or other punctuation, and the parser needs to account for different delimiters.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser must robustly handle these cases and any other peculiarities of Markdown formatting."
