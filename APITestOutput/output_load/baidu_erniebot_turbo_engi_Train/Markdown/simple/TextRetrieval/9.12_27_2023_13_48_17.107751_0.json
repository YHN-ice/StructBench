A parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Bold within Other Elements**: Bold text might be nested within other elements like lists, blockquotes, or headings. The parser needs to correctly identify bold text within these contexts.\n\n3. **Escaped Bold Markers**: Users might escape bold markers using a backslash to prevent them from being parsed as bold, like `**not bold\\**`. The parser should recognize these cases and not extract them as bold text.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Bold syntax within inline code blocks (surrounded by backticks `) should not be interpreted as bold text.\n\n5. **Fenced Code Blocks**: Similar to inline code blocks, text within fenced code blocks (surrounded by triple backticks ```) should not be treated as bold.\n\n6. **Links or Images with Bold Text**: Markdown links or images may also contain bold syntax. The parser should differentiate between the actual link/image syntax and the bold markers.\n\n7. **Partial Overlaps**: There might be overlapping styles like `**bold and _italic_**` where part of the text is both bold and italic. The parser needs to extract only the bold parts correctly.\n\n8. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text could span multiple lines, which might complicate the parsing if the parser is designed to read line by line.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, a robust Markdown file parser would need to be carefully designed to handle various edge cases and ensure accurate extraction of bold text."
