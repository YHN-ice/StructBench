A parser must handle all such cases.\n\n2. **Nested emphasis**: Bold text can be nested within other formatting elements like italics, links, or strikethroughs. E.g., `**bold _and italic_**`. The parser should be able to extract the bold text while considering the context.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: The asterisk or underscore characters might be escaped within the text, which means they are not intended to format the text as bold. E.g., `\\**not bold**`. The parser should ignore these.\n\n4. **Inline code blocks**: Text within inline code blocks (surrounded by backticks `) should not be formatted, even if it contains bold syntax. E.g., `` `**not bold**` ``.\n\n5. **Code blocks and fences**: Similar to inline code blocks, multiline code blocks (indented by four spaces or surrounded by triple backticks) should not contain formatted text.\n\n6. **Link labels**: Bold syntax inside the link label part should not be treated as bold text when extracting. E.g., `[**link**](url)`.\n\n7. **Line breaks and paragraphs**: Bold text can span across multiple lines or be part of a single paragraph. The parser needs to handle line continuity.\n\n8. **Inconsistent formatting**: Sometimes, the asterisks or underscores might not be properly matched or used inconsistently, leading to malformed Markdown that may still render correctly in some parsers.\n\n9. **List items and blockquotes**: Bold text can be part of list items or blockquotes, which might affect the way it's parsed depending on the implementation.\n\n10. **Literal asterisks or underscores in text**: Asterisks or underscores might be part of the actual content and not meant for formatting, e.g., in mathematical contexts or when discussing the symbols themselves.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be designed with robust handling for various Markdown edge cases to accurately extract all bold texts. When you provide the input file, I'll proceed with extracting the bold texts accordingly."
