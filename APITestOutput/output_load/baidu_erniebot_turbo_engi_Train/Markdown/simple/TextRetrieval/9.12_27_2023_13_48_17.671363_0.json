Different Markdown syntaxes for bold: Markdown supports multiple ways to denote bold text, such as using double asterisks `**bold text**` or double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser needs to recognize all the possible syntaxes.\n\n2. Nested bold within other elements: Bold text can be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, headings, etc. The parser should be able to extract bold text from within these structures.\n\n3. Inline code blocks and fenced code blocks: Text within code blocks should not be interpreted as bold, even if it contains `**` or `__`. The parser must distinguish between code blocks and regular text.\n\n4. Escaped characters: Users can escape the Markdown syntax to prevent formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to respect escaped characters and not interpret them as formatting commands.\n\n5. Overlapping formatting: Bold syntax could overlap with italics or other formatting types, for example, `**bold _and italic_**`. The parser must handle these cases correctly and only extract the bold part.\n\n6. Incomplete or incorrect syntax: Users might make mistakes in their Markdown formatting (e.g., `**bold text`). The parser should decide how to handle these cases - whether to be strict and ignore them or try to interpret the user's intention.\n\n7. Multi-line bold text: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser should be able to detect and handle it correctly.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to scan the content while considering these potential challenges to extract all bold texts correctly."
