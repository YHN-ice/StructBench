Ensuring all types of URLs are captured without missing or misinterpreting parts can be tricky.\n\n3. **Distractors**: There might be non-image links or other syntax elements that resemble image markdown syntax, which could lead to false positives.\n\n4. **Escaped characters**: In some cases, characters like `!` or `[]` might be escaped in the document, which can affect how the content is parsed.\n\n5. **File path variations**: The file paths for images can vary significantly. They can be local (relative) paths or complete URLs to external resources. Distinguishing between these and extracting just the file names requires careful parsing.\n\n6. **Markdown variations and extensions**: Different flavors of Markdown might introduce unique ways to include images or extend the basic syntax, which could necessitate a more robust or customizable parsing approach.\n\n7. **Title and alt text confusion**: Sometimes the title or alt text of an image link (which is optional) might contain brackets or parentheses, which can interfere with simple parsing methods.\n\nTo handle these potential difficulties, a parser would need to be thorough with its pattern matching and consider all possible variations and edge cases when looking for image links and extracting their filenames."
