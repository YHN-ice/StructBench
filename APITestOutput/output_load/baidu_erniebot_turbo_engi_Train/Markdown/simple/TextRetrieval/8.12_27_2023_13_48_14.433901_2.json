Identifying and correctly parsing both Markdown and HTML image syntax could be challenging.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in a Markdown file can be referenced using absolute URLs (e.g., `http://example.com/image.jpg`) or relative paths (e.g., `images/image.jpg`). Distinguishing between the two and extracting only the file names requires careful parsing.\n\n3. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes, links can be confused with images if not parsed correctly, as their syntax is similar (e.g., `[link text](URL)` for links versus `![alt text](image_url)` for images).\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows for reference-style images, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but is instead placed elsewhere in the document. These might be harder to detect without scanning the entire document.\n\n5. **Nested Content**: Images may be nested within other elements, such as lists or blockquotes, complicating the parsing process.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes image syntax might include escaped characters that need to be handled properly to extract the correct file name.\n\n7. **False Positives**: There might be false positives where certain text follows a pattern similar to that of an image but is not an actual image reference.\n\n8. **File Extensions**: There are multiple valid image file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.), and the parser should recognize all common ones.\n\n9. **Markdown Extensions/Variants**: Different Markdown processors and extensions might have additional or altered syntax for embedding images that need to be considered.\n\nTo correctly extract the file names, the parser must be able to handle all these cases and any other edge cases that might appear in the Markdown content."
