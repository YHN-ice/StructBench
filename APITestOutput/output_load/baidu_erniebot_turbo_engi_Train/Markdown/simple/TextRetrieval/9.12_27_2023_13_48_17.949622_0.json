The most common are double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`) surrounding the text. We must ensure that we recognize all possible syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting nested inside, such as italic, strikethrough, or inline code. We'll need to handle these cases correctly without including any additional formatting markers.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users may escape the bold syntax markers (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means the text is not meant to be bold. We must detect and ignore escaped markers.\n\n4. **False Positives**: There could be pairs of asterisks or underscores that are not intended for bold formatting (e.g., in URLs or in code blocks). We need to differentiate between actual formatting and non-formatting uses of these characters.\n\n5. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes a user might accidentally leave incomplete markers like a single asterisk or underscore which could be confused with the bold syntax.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Markdown usually allows text to be bolded across multiple lines, which could complicate extraction as it requires handling line breaks within bold sections.\n\n7. **Link Labels**: In Markdown, square brackets are used for links and could be mistakenly identified as bold if not correctly parsed.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the approach must be robust enough to handle various cases of bold syntax, escape characters, and other markdown elements interspersed with the bold text."
