The parser must be able to recognize both syntaxes.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements like italic, code, or links. Extracting only the bold part may require parsing out the nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape the bold syntax to prevent it from being parsed, such as `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser must distinguish between actual bold text and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Partial Matches**: Text like `**bold*not bold**` is a common mistake that could confuse the parser. It must correctly identify complete, correctly-formed bold syntax.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser must handle line breaks within the bold syntax correctly.\n\n6. **Contextual Bold**: In some cases, bold syntax might be used in a context where it shouldn't be interpreted as bold (e.g., within code blocks or inline code).\n\n7. **False Positives**: The parser must avoid false positives, such as interpreting non-Markdown uses of asterisks or underscores as bold (e.g., mathematical expressions or separators).\n\n8. **Platform-Specific Extensions**: Some platforms extend the Markdown syntax with their own rules for bold. The parser will need to handle these extensions if they are used in the input file.\n\nTo successfully extract bold texts, the parser will need to parse the Markdown file while considering the above complexities and output the raw text without any surrounding formatting characters."
