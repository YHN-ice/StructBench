Ensuring all variations are accounted for can be challenging.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text may contain other Markdown elements like links `[link](url)`, italics `*italic*`, or code `backticks`. Parsing nested elements correctly without losing the bold formatting is essential.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores can be escaped with backslashes to prevent them from being parsed as formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. Identifying and correctly handling escaped characters is necessary to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: There may be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed, like `**bold text`. Deciding how to handle these incomplete formatting markers is important for accurate parsing.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Markdown allows for line breaks within bold text. However, parsing tools might have issues if they don't account for line breaks within formatting delimiters.\n\n6. **Contextual Formatting**: Text that appears to be formatted as bold might not be, depending on the context. For example, asterisks inside code blocks or inline code should not be parsed as bold.\n\n7. **Performance Considerations**: For large Markdown files with lots of formatting, the parser must be efficient to perform well without consuming excessive resources.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a careful approach to accurately parse and extract all bold texts from any given Markdown file."
