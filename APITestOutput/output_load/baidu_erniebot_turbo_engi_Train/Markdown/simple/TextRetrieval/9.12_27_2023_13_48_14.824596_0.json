The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` and double underscores `__bold text__`. We'll need to ensure we recognize both formats.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text could contain other formatting inside it, such as italic, links, or code spans. We'll need to decide whether to include or exclude this nested content.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes the asterisks or underscores might be escaped to show them as literal characters, like `\\**not bold\\**`. This should not be treated as bold text.\n\n4. **Incomplete syntax**: If the syntax is not correctly closed, like `**bold`, it usually isn't considered as bold by Markdown parsers. We need to decide how strict we are with syntax completeness.\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: Sometimes, the bold text might span multiple lines, though not all Markdown flavors support this.\n\n6. **Lists, headings, or other block elements**: Bold text might be part of a larger block element like lists or headings. We have to ensure these don't interfere with recognizing the bold text.\n\n7. **Edge cases with punctuation**: Sometimes bold syntax can be immediately followed by punctuation, which can be tricky for regex-based parsers to handle correctly.\n\n8. **Link labels**: In Markdown, links can have labels that are formatted with bold. We should consider if those should be included or not.\n\nFor each of these challenges, we would need a strategy to either handle them correctly or to specify that certain cases are not supported by our parser."
