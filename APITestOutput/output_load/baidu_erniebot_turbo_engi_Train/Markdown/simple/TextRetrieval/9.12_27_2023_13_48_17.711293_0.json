When parsing a Markdown file to extract bold text, a few potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise include:\n\n1. **Different Syntax for Bold**: Markdown has multiple ways to denote bold text. The two most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` and double underscores `__bold text__`. We need to ensure we capture both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text in Markdown can contain other Markdown elements like links `[text](url)`, italicized text `*italic*` or `**_italic_**`, inline code `` `code` ``, or even other bold elements `**bold with **nested** bold**`. Extracting just the bold text while handling these nested elements can be complex.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape the bold syntax to prevent Markdown rendering with a backslash `\\`. For example, `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*` should not be considered bold text.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Paired Delimiters**: There may be incorrectly paired delimiters that are not intended to render as bold, like `**bold text*` or `**bold**text**`.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which could be tricky to match with simple parsers that only look at single lines at a time.\n\n6. **Partial Overlap with Other Elements**: Sometimes, bold syntax could be partially overlapped with other markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or headers, which might affect the correct extraction of the bold text.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) and inline code (surrounded by backticks `) should not be parsed as Markdown formatting. Hence, any bold syntax within code blocks should not be treated as bold text.\n\nTo handle these, we'd need a robust Markdown parser that can correctly interpret the Markdown specification and extract the bold text while considering the context and possible edge cases mentioned above."
