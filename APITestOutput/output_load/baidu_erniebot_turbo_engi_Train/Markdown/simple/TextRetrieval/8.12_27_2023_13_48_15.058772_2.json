The most common syntax is `![Alt text](URL)` but variations could include reference-style images or images with additional attributes like title or size.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Images could be linked using relative paths (like `./images/picture.jpg`) or absolute URLs (such as `https://example.com/image.png`). The parser needs to distinguish between these and extract the file names accordingly.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files include raw HTML for more complex formatting. If images are embedded using HTML `<img>` tags, the parser must also be able to recognize and extract these sources.\n\n4. **Link confusion**: Markdown syntax for links is similar to that for images; a link is `![Alt text](URL)` vs. an image `![Alt text](URL)`. An image is preceded by an exclamation mark. The parser must differentiate between the two.\n\n5. **Escaped characters**: If the exclamation mark or other characters in the image syntax are escaped, it is not an actual image tag but plain text.\n\n6. **Textual content**: Some Markdown files contain textual content that may resemble an image link (for instance, in code blocks or quoted text). The parser has to ignore these cases and only consider actual image links.\n\n7. **Broken syntax**: Sometimes, Markdown syntax may be incorrectly applied, leading to broken image links. The parser must decide whether to ignore these or attempt to recover the intended file name.\n\n8. **File name extraction**: Once the correct pattern is identified, the parser must accurately extract just the file name, which can include processing query parameters or fragments in URLs.\n\nAfter considering these challenges, we can proceed with parsing the provided Markdown file to extract image file names."
