We need to account for all possible syntaxes used for bold text.\n\n2. **Incorrect Formatting**: If the Markdown file has incorrectly formatted bold syntax, it may lead to incomplete or incorrect extraction of bold text. For example, if there's a missing asterisk in `**bold text*`.\n\n3. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or headers. This nesting could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Literal Asterisks**: There might be literal asterisks in the text that are not meant to indicate bold formatting, which could be confused with bold syntax.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes asterisks are escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting, like `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be considered as bold text.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Some Markdown processors allow for bold text to span multiple lines, which would require the parser to handle multiline patterns.\n\n7. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is very large, performance might become an issue when parsing the file.\n\n8. **Limitations of Tools**: Depending on the tools used to parse the Markdown file, there may be limitations in their ability to accurately identify or extract all instances of bold text.\n\nTo properly extract bold texts, I need to be able to accurately identify and handle these cases while ensuring that only the content meant to be in bold is extracted."
