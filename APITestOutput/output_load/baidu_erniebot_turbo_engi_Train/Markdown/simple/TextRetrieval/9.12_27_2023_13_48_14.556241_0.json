Commonly, `**text**` and `__text__` are used to denote bold, but there might be differences in edge cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might be nested within other elements, like links (`[link](url)`), images, or even other bold or italic text. This can make it tricky to extract just the bold text without pulling in unwanted elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the Markdown might include escaped characters like `**text\\*\\***`, which should be interpreted differently than regular bold syntax.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: There might be instances where the bold markers are incomplete or malformed, such as `**text*` or `**text`, which could lead to incorrect parsing if not handled properly.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (enclosed in triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) and inline code (enclosed in single backticks `) should not be interpreted as bold, even if it contains `**`.\n\n6. **Other Formatting**: Markdown may include other formatting such as headers, lists, blockquotes, which might contain bold syntax. Parsing should be context-aware to handle these variations properly.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which requires handling line breaks within the bold markers correctly.\n\n8. **Whitespace Handling**: Markdown can be flexible with whitespace, so parsers must handle cases where there's extra space around the bold markers correctly.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the parser must be robust enough to handle all these cases to extract only the intended bold text accurately."
