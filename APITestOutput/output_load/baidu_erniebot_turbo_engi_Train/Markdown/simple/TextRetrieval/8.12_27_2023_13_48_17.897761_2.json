When parsing a Markdown file to extract image file names, several challenges may arise:\n\n1. **Variety of Image Syntax**: Markdown allows images to be included using different syntax styles. The most common one is the inline image syntax (`![Alt text](URL)`), but there may also be reference-style images where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative to the document or absolute URLs. Extracting the filename might require different handling for each case.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Images can have various file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`). The parser needs to be aware of these to accurately identify image files.\n\n4. **Alt Text with Embedded Brackets**: The alternative text for images can sometimes include square brackets (`[]`), which might interfere with parsing if not handled properly.\n\n5. **Link vs. Image**: Markdown syntax for links is similar to images, with the main difference being an exclamation mark (`!`) at the start for images. In complex documents, distinguishing between the two can be tricky.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows escaping of certain characters like `!` or `[ ]`, so the parser must distinguish between actual image syntax and escaped characters that are not meant to define an image.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images can be nested inside other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes, which might complicate extracting the image file names.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on the Same Line**: There could be multiple images on a single line, requiring the parser to handle multiple matches in one line of text.\n\n9. **Incorrect Markdown Syntax**: Sometimes, the Markdown file might contain errors or non-standard syntax that could confuse the parser.\n\n10. **Textual Content**: Text content in the Markdown file might coincidentally contain sequences that resemble image syntax but are not meant as images, such as in code blocks or comments.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must have robust pattern recognition capabilities and consider Markdown's syntax rules when identifying image files. Now, please present the input Markdown file so that I may proceed with extracting the image filenames."
