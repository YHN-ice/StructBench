The standard syntax for this is `![Alt text](URL/to/image)`. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax:** There may be variations in the Markdown syntax for embedding images, such as the use of different brackets or parentheses, which could make it harder to identify image links.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images:** Markdown also allows for reference-style image links, where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document. This would require identifying and matching reference links.\n\n3. **Image URLs vs File Paths:** The included 'images' could be URLs to external resources or file paths to local images. We would need to identify which ones are actual file names.\n\n4. **Alt Text Complexity:** The alt text for an image could potentially include characters that confuse the parsing (like parentheses or brackets).\n\n5. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes characters like `!` or `[` might be escaped within the Markdown file, which could lead to false negatives when searching for images.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown:** Images could be nested within other Markdown elements, such as links or lists, which could make the parsing more complex.\n\n7. **Non-standard Extensions:** Some Markdown files might use non-standard extensions or HTML for including images, which would not be covered by the standard Markdown image syntax.\n\n8. **False Positives:** There might be text that looks like an image link but isn't (for example, in a code block or quoted), which we would not want to count as an actual image.\n\nThese are just some potential issues; there may be others depending on the specific content and structure of the Markdown file we'll be parsing."
