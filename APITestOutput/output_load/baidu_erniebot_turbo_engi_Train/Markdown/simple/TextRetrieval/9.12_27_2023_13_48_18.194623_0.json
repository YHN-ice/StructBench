Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Multiple syntax options for bold:** Markdown can use multiple syntax options to denote bold text, typically `**text**` or `__text__`. The parser should recognize both patterns.\n\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text in Markdown can contain other formatting, like italic (`*text*` or `_text_`), strikethrough (`~~text~~`), or inline code blocks (`` `code` ``). The parser must correctly handle these without confusing the nested syntax for the bold markers.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Bold markers can be escaped to display as literal asterisks or underscores, e.g., `\\*\\*text\\*\\*` should not be parsed as bold. The parser needs to differentiate between escaped and unescaped characters.\n\n4. **False positives in code blocks or inline code:** Bold syntax within code blocks (indented with four spaces, fenced with `` ``` ``, or inline code using backticks) should not be treated as bold text, as Markdown formatting is usually not processed inside code blocks.\n\n5. **Inconsistent formatting:** Sometimes users don't follow strict Markdown syntax, like missing one asterisk in a pair. The parser should ideally handle such cases gracefully or report them as errors.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text:** Markdown supports bold text that spans multiple lines. The parser might need to handle newlines within bold syntax.\n\n7. **Link descriptions:** The description of links in Markdown `[link description](URL)` could also include bold markers, which should be parsed correctly.\n\n8. **Performance:** If the Markdown file is large, the parser must be efficient enough to process the bold text without significant performance issues.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll apply the appropriate logic to extract all bold texts while considering these potential difficulties and obstacles."
