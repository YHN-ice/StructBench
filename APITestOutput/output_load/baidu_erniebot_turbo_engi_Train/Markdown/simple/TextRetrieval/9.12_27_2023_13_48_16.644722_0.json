For example, `**this is _italic_ and bold**`.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: There might be escaped characters that could disrupt the parsing process. For example, `\\**not bold\\**`.\n\n4. **False positives**: Text with asterisks or underscores not intended for bold formatting could be mistakenly detected. For example, `** not bold because of the space**`.\n\n5. **Inconsistent formatting**: Users might not follow Markdown syntax perfectly, leading to broken formatting that is hard to interpret programmatically.\n\n6. **Cross-paragraph bolding**: Bold text that starts in one paragraph and ends in another might be difficult to detect.\n\n7. **Inline code blocks**: Bold syntax within inline code blocks should not be considered as bold text, such as `` `This is not **bold**` ``.\n\nEach of these potential obstacles requires careful handling to ensure accurate extraction of bold text from the Markdown file."
