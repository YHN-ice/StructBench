The syntax for bold text could vary (e.g., `**bold**`, `__bold__`, etc.).\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other elements, such as links, italics, or even within other bold text, which can complicate the parsing process.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the bold markers (`*`, `_`) might be escaped with a backslash to display them as literals rather than formatting, which should not be confused with actual formatting.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Paired Markers**: Users may have made errors in their Markdown, such as unpaired or mismatched asterisks or underscores, which would need to be handled or ignored.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks and inline code is not formatted as bold, even if it contains double asterisks or underscores, so these should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n6. **Inline HTML**: Markdown allows for inline HTML, so bold tags (`<b>` and `<strong>`) should be considered if present.\n\n7. **Lists and Blockquotes**: Bold text might appear within lists or blockquotes, and the parser must recognize and extract them correctly despite the additional syntax.\n\n8. **Multiline Bold Text**: Some implementations of Markdown allow for bold text to span multiple lines. The parser needs to be able to handle multiline content appropriately.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, the parser must be robust enough to handle these potential issues and provide accurate results."
