We need to correctly identify this pattern, keeping in mind that there can be variations and that not all URLs might point to image files.\n\n2. **Variations in Syntax**: Some Markdown files might use reference-style links for images, where the URL is not inline but rather defined elsewhere in the document. Example:\n   ```\n   ![Alt text][id]\n   ...\n   [id]: URL \"Title\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Image File Extensions**: We need to identify what constitutes an image file by recognizing common image file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.). There might be URLs that do not end with an image extension but still point to an image file (dynamic images served by scripts or APIs).\n\n4. **False Positives**: URLs containing the image extension might not actually be images (e.g., a link to a downloadable image file rather than the image itself).\n\n5. **Encoded URLs or Parameters**: Some image URLs might be URL-encoded or contain query parameters which could complicate the extraction of the file name.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows for escaping characters which might result in escaped image syntax that is not intended to display an image.\n\n7. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The images could be linked using absolute URLs (http://...) or relative URLs (/path/to/image.jpg). We would need to handle both cases.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There could be multiple images listed on one line, meaning we would need to parse each one separately.\n\n9. **Consecutive Images Without Space**: If there are no spaces between consecutive images, it might be challenging to separate the image URLs.\n\n10. **Images within Other Elements**: Images could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which might affect how they are parsed.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll need to parse it while keeping these potential issues in mind to correctly extract all included image file names."
