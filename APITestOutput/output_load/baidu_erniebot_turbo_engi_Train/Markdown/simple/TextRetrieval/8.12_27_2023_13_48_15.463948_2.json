However, there are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Different Markdown Image Syntaxes**: Markdown supports different ways to include images. The most common format is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations might exist, such as reference-style links.\n\n2. **Image URLs vs. File Names**: Sometimes images are included with full URLs rather than just file names. In such cases, we need to differentiate between external links and actual file names present in the repository.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative or absolute. We must handle both cases to extract the file names correctly.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: There are various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.). We must be prepared to recognize all common image file types.\n\n5. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files use raw HTML to include images. These won't follow the Markdown syntax and can be more challenging to identify.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows escaping characters that might be part of the syntax, which means some image-like text might not actually render as an image.\n\n7. **File Names with Spaces or Special Characters**: File names might have spaces or special characters that are encoded or written differently in the Markdown file.\n\n8. **Line Breaks**: Image references might be broken across multiple lines, especially if they include long URLs or titles.\n\nIt's important to note that as a language model AI, my capabilities are not exactly those of a Markdown file parser, so I can only provide answers based on the information you provide from the Markdown content. If you have the actual input file or its content, please share that for an accurate answer."
