Ensuring all variations are accounted for can be tricky.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can have nested formatting like links `[link](url)`, italics, or code spans. Extracting just the bold text while handling or ignoring nested formatting could be complex.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks or underscores might be used in the document for other purposes, such as bullet points or horizontal lines, and not for bold formatting. Differentiating these uses is necessary.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which means they shouldn't be treated as bold syntax.\n\n5. **Incomplete Pairs**: There might be instances where the markdown is not correctly formatted (e.g., `**bold` without a closing `**`), making it ambiguous whether the text should be treated as bold.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown doesn't officially support multiline bold text, but some parsers do allow it. If a Markdown file contains such patterns, deciding whether to treat them as bold could be challenging.\n\n7. **Code Blocks or Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (enclosed by triple backticks ``` or single backticks ` for inline code) should not be interpreted as formatted text. Distinguishing these from regular text is crucial.\n\nEach of these cases must be carefully considered while parsing and extracting bold text from the input Markdown file to ensure accuracy."
