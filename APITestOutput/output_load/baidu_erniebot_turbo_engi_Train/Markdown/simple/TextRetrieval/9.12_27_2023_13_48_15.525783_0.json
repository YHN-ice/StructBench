We need to handle all possible variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other elements like links `[**bold text**](URL)` or italics `*italic **bold** text*`. Properly identifying and extracting just the bold portion requires parsing the context around the bold markers.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape the bold syntax characters so that they don't get interpreted as formatting (e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`). We need to differentiate between actual bold syntax and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, users make mistakes by having unbalanced markers (e.g., `**bold text`). This might require a decision on whether to consider these as bold or not.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, so the parser must be able to handle multiline cases.\n\n6. **Code Blocks**: Text within code blocks (enclosed in backticks ` or triple backticks ```) should not be interpreted as formatted text, including bold.\n\n7. **Performance Considerations**: If the Markdown file is large, there might be performance considerations when parsing the file to extract information.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we may need to take a careful approach to correctly identify all the bold texts within the given Markdown input while accounting for these various factors."
