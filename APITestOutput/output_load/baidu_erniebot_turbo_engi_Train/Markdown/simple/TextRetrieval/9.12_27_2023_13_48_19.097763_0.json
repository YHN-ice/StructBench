Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Multiple formatting styles**: Markdown allows for bold text to be indicated using double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__). The parser must recognize both styles.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, links, or code blocks. We need to ensure that the bold formatting is correctly identified even within these contexts.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks and underscores used for other purposes (not for bold formatting) might be escaped with a backslash (\\\\), which should not be treated as a bold indicator.\n\n4. **Partial formatting mismatches**: There may be cases where the bold syntax is not properly matched, such as an opening asterisk without a corresponding closing asterisk. The parser needs to handle these cases correctly.\n\n5. **Line breaks**: If the bold text is split across multiple lines, the parser has to interpret it correctly, even if Markdown specifications typically don't support this.\n\n6. **False positives**: Texts that appear to be bold due to the presence of asterisks or underscores but are not actually formatted as such in the rendered Markdown (e.g., due to incorrect syntax) should not be extracted.\n\nThe parser must be designed to handle all these cases correctly in order to extract the bold texts accurately."
