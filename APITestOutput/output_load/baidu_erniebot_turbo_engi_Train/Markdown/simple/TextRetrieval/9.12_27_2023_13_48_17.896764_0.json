It's necessary to identify all methods used in the input file.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might have nested elements such as links `[text](url)`, italics, inline code, or even other bold elements. We'll need to ensure that only the bold portion is extracted, without any nested markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores might be escaped within the text, meaning they shouldn't be interpreted as marking bold text. For example, `\\**not bold\\**`.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: There might be instances where the bold markers are incomplete or mismatched, which could complicate identifying bold text correctly.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) and inline code (surrounded by backticks `) should not be interpreted as bold, even if double asterisks or underscores are present.\n\n6. **Different Line Breaks**: Bold text may span across multiple lines, which needs to be handled carefully to ensure full extraction.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are also used for other formatting purposes like lists or horizontal lines. We must differentiate between these uses and when they're meant to denote bold text.\n\n8. **HTML Tags**: Markdown may also contain HTML tags, including `<strong>` or `<b>`, which similarly indicate bold text.\n\n9. **Parsing Efficiency**: Depending on the size of the input file and the complexity of its content, the efficiency of parsing might become an issue.\n\n10. **Contextual Understanding**: Finally, ensuring that the correct context is interpreted is key since markdown is often about conveying meaning as much as formatting.\n\nAfter acknowledging these potential difficulties, we can proceed with extracting the bold texts once the input file is provided."
