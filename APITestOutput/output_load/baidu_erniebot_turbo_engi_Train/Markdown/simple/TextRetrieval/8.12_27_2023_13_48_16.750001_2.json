The parser needs to handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images may be nested within other elements like links or lists, which could complicate the parsing process. Handling nested structures requires a more complex parsing algorithm.\n\n3. **Different File Paths**: Image paths could be absolute URLs, relative paths, or even data URIs. The parser should be able to differentiate between these and extract only the file names or URLs.\n\n4. **Alt Text and Titles**: Images in Markdown can also include alt text and titles (`![alt text](image-path \"title\")`). These should not be confused with the file paths.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax might contain escaped characters (like `\\!` or `\\]`) that should not be interpreted as Markdown elements. The parser should correctly handle these characters.\n\n6. **Links without Images**: Not every link in Markdown is an image link. The parser must distinguish between image links and regular hyperlinks to avoid false positives.\n\n7. **Irregular Formatting**: Some Markdown files might have irregular formatting or errors that don't follow the standard Markdown conventions. The parser may need to handle these gracefully.\n\n8. **Performance Concerns**: If the Markdown file is very large with many images, the parser should be efficient enough to extract all images without significant performance issues.\n\n9. **File Name Extraction**: Once the image paths are identified, extracting just the file names (if required) from absolute or relative paths could be another step that may need special attention.\n\nThese obstacles will require careful consideration when designing or implementing a Markdown file parser to ensure accurate extraction of image file names. Now, if you provide the input file, I can attempt to parse it and extract the included image file names."
