However, there are several challenges we might face:\n\n1. **Variations in Image Syntax**: Markdown allows images to be included with `![Alt text](URL)` where `URL` can be a local file path or a web URL. Some Markdown variants may allow additional syntax or attributes.\n\n2. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, images are embedded using plain HTML tags (like `<img src=\"...\">`) within the Markdown file. This can complicate parsing as we need to handle both Markdown and HTML syntax.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also supports reference-style images where the URL is not inline with the alt text, making it harder to parse as we need to match references to their corresponding URLs elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: URLs might be encoded or include special characters that could complicate the extraction process.\n\n5. **Link Confusion**: Identifying whether a link is an image link or a webpage link if the image syntax isn't properly used, such as missing the exclamation mark before the brackets.\n\n6. **Comments and Non-standard Usage**: Image links could be commented out or used in non-standard ways that aren't intended for image display, which could lead to false positives in extraction.\n\n7. **Textual Noise**: Descriptive text or other non-URL content within the parentheses following the exclamation mark and brackets could lead to incorrect file names being extracted.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to parse it carefully to address these potential issues and extract the image file names correctly."
