Handling all these variations requires a comprehensive approach.\n\n2. **Multiline Definitions**: Sometimes the definition of a reference-style link can be split across multiple lines which means that the parser must be able to handle multiline patterns.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Some file names might include escape characters to include literal characters that would otherwise be interpreted as Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **URLs vs. File Paths**: Images in Markdown can be linked via URLs or local file paths. The parser should differentiate between URLs and extract only file names if that's what's required.\n\n5. **Alt Text Confusion**: The alt text for images might contain brackets or parentheses which could confuse a simple parser not accounting for nested or mismatched brackets.\n\n6. **Comments and Disabled Links**: Markdown does not have a standard comment syntax, but HTML comments might be used. Also, some image links might be disabled (commented out) and should not be considered.\n\n7. **Complex File Paths**: File names might not be simple and can include directories, subdirectories, or even URL parameters if the image is hosted externally.\n\nTo accurately extract image files, the parser must correctly handle all these potential issues. Once I see the input file, I can determine which of these obstacles are present and approach them accordingly."
