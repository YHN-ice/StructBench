Some parsers might not recognize both syntaxes, so it's important to account for both.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might be nested within other elements like links `[**text**](url)` or emphasis elements like `***bold and italic***`. It is necessary to handle these cases correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: In Markdown, asterisks or underscores can be escaped with a backslash to display them as literals rather than formatting characters, like `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser must differentiate between formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: Sometimes, the Markdown might be incorrectly formatted, with mismatched or unbalanced delimiters, like `**bold*` or `**bold***`. Deciding how to handle these cases can affect the output.\n\n5. **Code Blocks**: Text inside code blocks should not be parsed for formatting, so the parser needs to distinguish between code blocks (indented with spaces or fenced by backticks) and regular text.\n\n6. **Inline Code**: Inline code marked by single backticks may also include asterisks or underscores which shouldn't be parsed as bold.\n\n7. **Literal Asterisks or Underscores**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are used literally in the text for purposes other than bold formatting. The parser will need to identify and ignore these instances.\n\n8. **Complex Markdown Elements**: Other Markdown elements like lists, headers, blockquotes, etc., might include bold text within them. The parser must manage these without disrupting the overall structure.\n\nBy considering these potential obstacles, I will ensure that my parsing logic accounts for these edge cases when extracting bold text from a given Markdown input."
