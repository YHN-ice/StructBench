A parser must handle both.\n\n2. **Escaped characters**: The Markdown may contain escaped asterisks or underscores that should not be treated as formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold**`.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**: Bold text can have other formatting inside it, such as italic or code spans, which might complicate extraction (e.g., `**bold _italic_ text**`).\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting markers**: There may be instances of unmatched or incorrectly used asterisks/underscores which are not intended to render text as bold (e.g., `**bold text` without the closing `**`).\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines, and the parser should correctly identify and extract such instances.\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (indented with 4 spaces or fenced with triple backticks) and inline code (surrounded by backticks) should not be parsed for Markdown formatting.\n\n7. **Links and images**: The parser must distinguish between actual bold text and asterisks/underscores that might appear in links, image alt texts, or URLs.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is very large, the parser should efficiently extract bold texts without a significant performance hit.\n\n9. **Other Markdown extensions**: Some Markdown flavors provide extensions to the basic syntax, which could affect how bold text is detected and parsed.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust parsing algorithm or library that understands the full Markdown specification would be needed. Now, please provide the input file so I can attempt to extract the bold texts for you."
