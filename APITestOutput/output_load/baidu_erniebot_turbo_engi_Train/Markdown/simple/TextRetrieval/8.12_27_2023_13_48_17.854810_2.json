Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Variations in Image Syntax**: Markdown supports multiple ways to embed images, which typically follow the pattern `![Alt text](URL)`. However, there may be variations such as:\n   - Different alt text styles, or absence of it.\n   - Images referenced via reference-style links instead of inline links.\n   - Images included as HTML `<img>` tags for additional styling.\n\n2. **Complex URLs**: The URL portion of the image syntax might contain complex paths, query parameters, or fragment identifiers which might complicate the extraction of clean file names.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths could be relative to the document or could be absolute URLs pointing to an external resource. If absolute URLs are used, identifying the actual file name might require parsing the URL.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: Some URLs might be URL-encoded, which can obfuscate the file name.\n\n5. **Text Similar to Image Syntax**: Some text in the document might resemble image syntax but isn't intended as an image, such as code examples showing how to embed an image in Markdown.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be nested inside other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which can complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown parsers support non-standard extensions that modify or enhance the basic image syntax.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There could be multiple images on a single line, which the parser needs to handle correctly.\n\nThe parser would need to handle all these potential cases to accurately extract image file names from a given Markdown file."
