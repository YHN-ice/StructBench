Thus, the parser must recognize all possible patterns.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italics, links, or strikethroughs. The parser must be able to handle nested structures without losing the bold formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, the Markdown might include escaped bold syntax (like `\\**not bold\\**`). The parser needs to distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False positives**: There may be sequences of asterisks or underscores that are not meant for formatting, such as in code blocks or inline code snippets. The parser should ignore these.\n\n5. **Inconsistent use of spaces**: Some Markdown renderers require spacing between the bold markers and the enclosed text (like `** bold **`), while others do not. The parser must handle these variations.\n\n6. **Partial formatting**: In some cases, the bold markers might not be correctly paired (such as `**bold` without a closing `**`). Depending on the rules, the parser may need to decide whether to consider these as bold or not.\n\n7. **Line breaks**: Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle line breaks appropriately within the bolded section.\n\n8. **Contextual formatting**: Depending on the flavor of Markdown, some formatting may only apply in certain contexts (like within a list but not in a blockquote).\n\n9. **Performance issues**: If the input file is very large, performance optimization might be necessary to ensure timely parsing.\n\nAddressing these issues requires a robust parsing strategy that can accurately identify the start and end of bold text segments while handling edge cases and different markdown flavors."
