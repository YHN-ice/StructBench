The parser must recognize all valid syntax for bolding.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements within it, such as links `[**bold link**](url)`. The parser needs to correctly extract the bold text while handling nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to display them as literal characters rather than formatting marks, like `**bold \\*text\\***`. The parser must distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: The Markdown file might contain incorrectly formatted text that is intended to be bold but isn't due to syntax errors, such as `**bold*` with mismatched asterisks.\n\n5. **Incomplete Pairs**: There could be dangling asterisk or underscore pairs that do not correctly close, which might lead to parsing errors or incorrect extractions.\n\n6. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions or additional syntax for bolding text; however, these might not be universally recognized.\n\n7. **Contextual Parsing**: The parser must handle cases where asterisks or underscores appear in the text but are not used for formatting, such as in code blocks, where they should be treated as literal characters.\n\n8. **Line Breaks**: Markdown allows for line breaks within bold formatting, which might complicate extraction if the parser is not handling multiline patterns well.\n\n9. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is very large with lots of bold text, performance could become an issue, depending on the efficiency of the parser's implementation.\n\nTo resolve these issues, the parser must be robust and capable of understanding the Markdown specification thoroughly, handling edge cases and variations in the formatting syntax while providing correct extractions of bold text segments."
