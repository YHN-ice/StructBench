It will be important to extract the actual file name from this URL.\n\n4. **Link references**: Markdown allows for link references where the URL is not included directly with the image syntax but referenced at a different part of the document.\n\n5. **False positives**: Text that looks like image syntax but isn't meant to be an image (for example, an image link commented out or inside a code block).\n\n6. **Non-standard extensions**: Some Markdown files might include non-standard syntax extensions that could complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax could be escaped to avoid being treated as formatting, which could affect the extraction process.\n\n8. **Encoding issues**: File names may include special characters that are encoded in the Markdown file, which would need to be decoded for proper extraction.\n\nEach of these could potentially make it more difficult to accurately extract all included image files from a Markdown document. To overcome these obstacles, a Markdown parser must be flexible and robust enough to handle different scenarios and edge cases."
