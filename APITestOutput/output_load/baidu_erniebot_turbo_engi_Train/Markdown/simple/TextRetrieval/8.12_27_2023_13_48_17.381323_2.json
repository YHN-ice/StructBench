It's important for the parser to handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute URLs**: Image links can be either relative (pointing to a file within the same repository or directory structure) or absolute (pointing to an external resource). The parser must correctly identify the file name from both types of URLs.\n\n3. **Link Text and Titles**: Markdown image syntax can include additional information, such as link titles after the URL (`![alt text](image-url \"Title\")`), which should not be confused with the actual image file name.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: Some image URLs could be URL-encoded (e.g., spaces replaced by `%20`), or contain query parameters, and the parser should be able to decode these and extract just the file name.\n\n5. **Different File Extensions**: Image files can have various extensions, like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. The parser should recognize all common image file types.\n\n6. **Markdown Variants**: There are different flavors of Markdown, such as GitHub Flavored Markdown, MultiMarkdown, etc., which might have slight differences in how images are included.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown syntax may include escaped characters that might affect parsing, like a backslash before a character that would otherwise have been interpreted as syntax (e.g., `\\!` which should not start an image).\n\n8. **Nested Markdown Elements**: An image link might be nested within other Markdown elements, such as lists, blockquotes, or tables, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n9. **False Positives**: Sometimes there might be text that looks like an image link but isn't (e.g., an exclamation mark followed by brackets that aren't followed by parentheses).
