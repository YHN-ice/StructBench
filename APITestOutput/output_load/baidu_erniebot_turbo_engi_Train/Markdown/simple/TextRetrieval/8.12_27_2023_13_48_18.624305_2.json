Identifying which images are actual files as opposed to URLs might be a challenge.\n\n3. **Nested Links or Text**: Sometimes images can be nested inside links or surrounded by text, which can complicate the parsing process.\n\n4. **Different File Extensions**: Images can have different file extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. The parser needs to recognize all possible image file types.\n\n5. **Image Titles and Alt Text**: Images in Markdown can also have titles or alt text which can add additional text around the image URL, potentially causing confusion when extracting the URL.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: There could be escape characters in the Markdown that could affect how the image syntax is interpreted.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown files might use non-standard extensions or flavors of Markdown which could affect how images are referenced.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: File names might include spaces or special characters that are URL-encoded in the Markdown file.\n\n9. **Link Definitions without Images**: There might be link definitions that look like image references but aren't actually used for images.\n\n10. **Comments and HTML Tags**: Markdown can contain HTML comments or tags that might include image-like syntax but aren't meant to render as images.\n\nEach of these potential issues could complicate the process of correctly identifying and extracting all image file names from the Markdown file."
