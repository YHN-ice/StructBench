Here are some potential issues:\n\n1. **Different image syntax**: Markdown has multiple ways to embed images, such as `![alt text](image-url)` and HTML `<img>` tags. A parser must handle different syntaxes properly.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked with absolute URLs (http://example.com/image.jpg) or with relative paths (images/picture.jpg). The parser has to differentiate and possibly normalize these paths.\n\n3. **Link reference definitions**: Markdown allows for link references which could be used for images as well. This means the image URL might not be directly next to the image title but rather defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Non-image links**: It's important to differentiate between image links and other types of links to ensure only images are extracted.\n\n5. **Escaped characters**: There may be escaped characters that make parsing difficult, such as a literal exclamation point `\\!` not indicating an image.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown elements**: Sometimes images are nested within other elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, adding complexity to the parsing process.\n\n7. **Variants in alt text**: The alt text field might contain special characters or markdown itself which needs to be handled correctly.\n\n8. **Ignoring Code Blocks**: Code blocks may contain text that resembles markdown for images, but these should not be treated as actual images in the document.\n\nTo handle these issues, the parser needs to be robust and take into account the context in which potential image syntax appears."
