The parser needs to handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text can be nested within other Markdown elements, such as inside a list, a blockquote, or even combined with italic by using triple asterisks `***bold and italic***`. The parser must correctly identify bold text within these contexts.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores can be escaped with a backslash to display them literally, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should not interpret escaped characters as Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: Users may make errors in their Markdown formatting, such as uneven asterisks `**bold*` or missing closing tags `**bold`. The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (indicated by triple backticks ``` or indenting) and inline code (indicated by single backticks `) should not be interpreted as formatted text. The parser must distinguish between code and regular Markdown text.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Bold syntax might be part of a link `[**link text**](URL)` or an image `![**alt text**](URL)`. The parser should be able to extract the bold text correctly without including the link or image syntax.\n\n7. **Line Breaks and Paragraphs**: Markdown interprets line breaks in various ways depending on the context. The parser needs to handle line breaks within bold text correctly without breaking the formatting.\n\n8. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is large with many instances of bold text, the parser's performance could be an issue, and it would need to parse the file efficiently.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser should be robust enough to handle various edge cases and provide accurate extractions of bold text from the Markdown file."
