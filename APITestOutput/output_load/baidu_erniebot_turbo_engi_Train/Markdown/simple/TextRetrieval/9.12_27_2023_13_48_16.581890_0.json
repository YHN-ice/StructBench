We need to ensure we check for both formats.\n\n2. **Inline formatting:** Bold text can be part of a larger string that includes other formatting like italics, links, or inline code. We have to carefully extract only the bold portions without including other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Users might use backslashes to escape formatting characters. For example, \"\\**Not Bold\\**\" should not be considered bold text. We must identify and ignore escaped characters.\n\n4. **Nested formatting:** Bold text can have other formatting inside it, like italics or code spans. We need to extract the bold text while ignoring nested formatting.\n\n5. **False positives from code blocks or inline code:** Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks) or inline code (enclosed in single backticks) should not be considered for bold extraction, even if they contain sequences of asterisks or underscores.\n\n6. **Incomplete formatting markers:** Stray asterisks or underscores that do not correctly pair up to create bold formatting should be ignored.\n\n7. **Lists or headers that include bold text:** We have to make sure lists or headers that include bold text are handled properly.\n\nOnce provided with the input file, our task is to apply logic that accounts for these potential difficulties to accurately extract the bold text."
