The most common syntax is `![alt text](image_url)`, but there can be variations or extensions, such as reference-style links.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links in Markdown might be relative or absolute. A parser should extract the file name correctly in either case, but it's important to consider the context if the aim is to locate the files on disk.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain HTML tags, including image tags like `<img src=\"image_url\" alt=\"alt text\">`. A parser needs to handle these cases as well.\n\n4. **Links within Code Blocks**: If an image link is within a code block, it shouldn't typically be treated as an actual image embed. Recognizing code blocks and distinguishing them from regular text is necessary.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows characters to be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as special formatting. For instance, a backslash before an exclamation point or brackets might mean the user doesn't intend to embed an image.\n\n6. **Incorrect Formatting**: Sometimes, the Markdown may be incorrectly formatted, which could lead to false positives or negatives when trying to parse out image files.\n\n7. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support non-standard extensions that might affect how images are embedded.\n\nThe parser needs to handle these scenarios appropriately to extract image file names accurately."
