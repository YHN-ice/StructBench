The two most common methods are inline-style (`![Alt text](URL)`) and reference-style (`![Alt text][id]` where `id` is defined elsewhere in the document). We'll need to be able to handle both.\n\n2. Variations in Image Syntax: Some Markdown parsers support extensions or slight deviations from the standard syntax, such as adding image dimensions or titles. These variations could affect the parsing process.\n\n3. Relative vs. Absolute URLs: Images can be included with either relative paths or absolute URLs. When extracting image file names, it's important to correctly handle both types.\n\n4. Alt Text Confusion: The alt text of an image might contain brackets or other characters that could confuse a naive parsing algorithm.\n\n5. Nested Content: An image link could be nested inside other Markdown elements, making the parsing more complex.\n\n6. Escaped Characters: Markdown syntax may include escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly to avoid false positives or negatives when identifying image links.\n\n7. Non-image Links: It's important not to confuse image links with regular hyperlinks, which can have a similar format but serve a different purpose.\n\n8. Multiple Images on a Single Line: A line in Markdown could contain multiple images, so the parser will need to be able to handle multiple matches in a single string.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust parsing strategy that ideally involves regular expressions or a dedicated Markdown parsing library that can understand and isolate the image syntax accurately."
