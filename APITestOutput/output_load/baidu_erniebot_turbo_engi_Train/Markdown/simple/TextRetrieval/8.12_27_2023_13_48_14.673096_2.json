The most common is `![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")`, but variations may occur, such as omitting the alt text, title, or using reference-style links.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths:** Image sources can be either relative paths, absolute paths, or full URLs. Each type requires a different method of extraction and handling.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML tags:** Some Markdown files might embed images using raw HTML `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax. This requires a different parsing strategy.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs and spaces in filenames:** URLs might be percent-encoded, and spaces in filenames might be replaced with `%20` or other characters, which need to be decoded for proper filename extraction.\n\n5. **Link references separate from the image syntax:** In reference-style linking, the URL for an image is not in the same place as the image markup, which may require additional parsing to connect the reference to the actual image file.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown elements:** An image link might be nested inside other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n7. **Non-image links:** The parser must differentiate between image links and non-image links (such as links to web pages or other types of files) to ensure only images are extracted.\n\n8. **Escape characters:** Markdown may use escape characters to denote literal characters which otherwise have syntactical significance, like `!`, `[`, `]`, `(`, or `)`, which may affect parsing.\n\n9. **False positives:** Text that looks like an image link but isn't intended as one (e.g., an example of the syntax in a code block or inline code) could lead to incorrect extraction.\n\n10. **File accessibility and verification:** Just because an image file is referenced in the Markdown does not guarantee that it is accessible or exists at the specified location.\n\nTo extract the correct filenames accurately, the parser must handle these potential issues effectively."
