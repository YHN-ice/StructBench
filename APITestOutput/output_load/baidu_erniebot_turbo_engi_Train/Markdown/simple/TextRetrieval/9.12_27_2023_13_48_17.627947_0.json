The parser must account for both methods.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, strikethrough, or even within links or code spans. The parser must be able to recognize bold text within these contexts.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax for bold may be escaped to display the asterisks or underscores literally, as in `**` or `__`. These should not be mistaken for actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Lines of text might contain pairs of asterisks or underscores that are not meant to denote bold text but could be incorrectly interpreted as such by a simple parser.\n\n5. **Incomplete Pairs**: There might be instances where the opening or closing syntax for bold is missing, creating incomplete pairs. Deciding how to handle these cases (as bold, not bold, or an error) can be challenging.\n\n6. **Incorrectly Formatted Text**: Text that is intended to be bold might not follow the correct syntax (like mismatched asterisks and underscores) and a strict parser might miss these cases.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle line breaks appropriately.\n\n8. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks and inline code should not be parsed as markdown formatting. The parser needs to distinguish between code segments and regular text properly.\n\nThe parser will need to navigate these challenges to accurately extract only the texts that are intended to be formatted as bold within the Markdown file."
