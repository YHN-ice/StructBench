We have to make sure to recognize all these patterns.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text in Markdown can contain other formatting, like italics `**bold *and italic* text**`, code spans `**bold `code` text**`, or links `**bold [link](url)**`. It's necessary to extract the bold text while correctly handling any nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash in the text, which means they shouldn't be treated as formatting characters, e.g., `\\**not bold**`.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting**: Sometimes, the Markdown might not be correctly formatted (e.g., missing a closing asterisk), which could lead to confusion about what is intended to be bold.\n\n5. **Line Breaks within Bold Text**: Line breaks might occur within bold text, which needs to be handled properly to avoid breaking the extraction.\n\n6. **Contextual Interpretation**: Asterisks and underscores can also be used for list items or emphasis, so their interpretation as bold markers might depend on context.\n\n7. **Performance and Scalability**: If the Markdown file is very large, the extraction process needs to be efficient.\n\nTo solve these issues, we might need to implement a robust parsing strategy that can handle all forms of bold syntax, nested formatting, and edge cases. This might involve writing regular expressions that accurately match bold patterns, or even processing the file with a state machine or parser library designed for Markdown."
