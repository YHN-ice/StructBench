Parsing would need to account for both types.\n\n3. **Images Linked Multiple Times**: The same image file might be referenced multiple times in the document. The parser would need to identify unique file names to avoid duplicates in the output.\n\n4. **Non-image Files**: URLs or paths might point to non-image files, so the parser should ideally verify the file extension (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) to confirm it's an image.\n\n5. **Text that Looks Like an Image Link**: There may be text within the Markdown that isn't an actual image link but has a similar structure. The parser needs to differentiate between actual image links and false positives.\n\n6. **Complex Paths**: Image paths might include directories, subdirectories, or even URL query parameters that could complicate extraction of the plain file name.\n\n7. **Image Titles or Hover Text**: Some Markdown image syntax includes titles or hover text after the URL (e.g., `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`), which should not be confused with the image path or name.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters or Whitespace**: File names may include spaces or characters escaped with backslashes that need to be handled correctly.\n\nConsidering these potential challenges, the parsing logic should be robust enough to accurately identify and extract only the intended image file names from the Markdown content."
