We must ensure that our parser can recognize all the valid ways to denote bold text.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might have other formatting nested inside, such as `[**link in bold**](http://example.com)`. We need to be able to extract the bold text while ignoring or properly handling the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: If an asterisk or underscore is preceded by a backslash, it is typically meant to be displayed as a literal character rather than as formatting. The parser must be able to differentiate between actual formatting markers and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Inline code blocks**: Text inside inline code blocks (denoted with backticks `` `like this` ``) should not be parsed for formatting. Bold syntax within inline code blocks should be ignored.\n\n5. **Code blocks and fenced code**: Text within code blocks (indented by four spaces or fenced by triple backticks) should not be considered for bold text extraction.\n\n6. **False positives**: Strings like `**` or `__` within text that do not actually indicate bold formatting (perhaps due to typos or incorrect Markdown usage) could lead to incorrect extractions.\n\n7. **Incorrect nesting**: Users might incorrectly nest the Markdown syntax, such as `**Bold __italic bold__**`. Extracting the bold text while handling such cases can be tricky.\n\n8. **Line breaks**: In Markdown, text formatting can continue across line breaks, so the parser must be able to handle multiline bold text.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be robust enough to handle a variety of cases and edge situations in order to correctly extract all bold texts from a Markdown document."
