You need to account for all possible syntaxes.\n\n2. **Image References**: Markdown also allows for image references, where the URL is not directly in the image tag but is referenced at the bottom of the document.\n\n3. **Alt Text Variability**: The alt text for images might contain brackets or other characters that could complicate the parsing, especially if the parser is using simple string matching.\n\n4. **Nested Content**: If images are included within nested structures like lists or blockquotes, it can be more challenging to extract them correctly without also capturing unwanted surrounding text.\n\n5. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The file paths for images can be relative or absolute. The parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n6. **Linked Images**: Images might be wrapped in links, which means the parser needs to distinguish between the link URL and the image URL.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions that allow for more complex image handling (like specifying classes, ids, or other attributes). These might not follow the typical Markdown syntax rules.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, characters in Markdown may be escaped, which could affect how URLs for images are parsed.\n\n9. **False Positives**: There could be instances where text looks like an image syntax but isn't meant to be an image (e.g., examples of Markdown syntax in a tutorial).\n\nTo correctly parse Markdown files for images, the parser must be robust enough to handle these various cases and smart enough to avoid false positives."
