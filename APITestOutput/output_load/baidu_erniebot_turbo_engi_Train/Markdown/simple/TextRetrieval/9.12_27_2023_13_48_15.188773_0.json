The parser needs to handle all the variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italics, strike-through, or links, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: Some bold texts might include escape characters that should be handled correctly (e.g., `\\**not bold**`).\n\n4. **False Positives**: There might be pairs of asterisks or underscores in the text that are not meant to denote bold formatting but are part of code blocks, URLs, or other content where they don't denote bold formatting.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, although this is less common in standard Markdown usage.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: The use of spaces between the asterisks/underscores and the text (e.g., `** bold **` vs `**bold**`) might cause inconsistencies that need to be handled by the parser.\n\n7. **Partially Formatted Text**: Sometimes, only part of a word or sentence might be formatted as bold, which could be tricky to correctly identify and extract.\n\n8. **Incorrectly Closed Tags**: In some cases, the syntax might not be properly closed (e.g., `**bold text`), which could lead to incorrect extraction or ignoring such instances.\n\nHandling these scenarios would ensure robust parsing and accurate extraction of bold texts from the Markdown file."
