The most common is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but variations might exist, and some Markdown files might contain HTML `<img>` tags.\n\n2. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images can be in various formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG) and the parser must be capable of recognizing and extracting all these types.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using either relative or absolute paths. The parser must handle both types of paths correctly.\n\n4. **Image References**: Markdown supports reference-style links and images. The actual URL of the image might be located elsewhere in the document, not directly under the image title or alt text.\n\n5. **Embedded Data Images**: Sometimes images are included as Base64 encoded data directly in the Markdown. Identifying and handling these cases might be necessary.\n\n6. **Links Disguised as Images**: There could be links that are formatted to look like image syntax but are not actual images. This could throw off a simple parsing algorithm.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: If the Markdown file uses escaped characters within image syntax, it might complicate the parsing process.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which requires the parser to understand context.\n\n9. **Variations in Markdown Flavors**: There are several \"flavors\" of Markdown (e.g., GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark), each with slight variations in syntax rules. The parser should ideally accommodate these variations.\n\n10. **Textual Noise**: Sometimes there's unrelated text or Markdown syntax around the image links that could be mistaken for part of the image's path or filename.\n\nThese challenges require a robust parsing algorithm capable of correctly identifying and extracting image file names from a diverse array of Markdown formatting scenarios."
