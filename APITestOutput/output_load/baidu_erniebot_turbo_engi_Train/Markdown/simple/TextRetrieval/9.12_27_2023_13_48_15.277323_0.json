It's important to account for both methods.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting, like italic or strikethrough. A simple search for bold markers may not work if they are interrupted by other syntax characters.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores could be escaped within the text, which means they're not used for formatting but are rather literal characters that should be displayed.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks using backticks `` ` `` should not be mistaken for bold text, even if it contains `**` or `__`.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Similar to inline code blocks, these blocks of text should be ignored when parsing for bold text, as they are meant to display literal text.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text in Markdown can span multiple lines, so the parser should be able to handle multiline patterns.\n\n7. **Links and Images**: Links and images may contain `**` or `__` in their URLs or alt text, which should not be mistaken for bold formatting.\n\n8. **False Positives and Partial Matches**: We want to avoid partial matches where only one asterisk or underscore is used, or cases where the asterisks or underscores are part of another unrelated markdown element.\n\nWhen implementing a parser to address these difficulties, it would likely involve using regular expressions with lookarounds to correctly identify the bold markers while excluding false positives and taking into account the context provided by the other Markdown syntax elements."
