Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could be encountered:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: Markdown has various ways to indicate bold text, such as using double asterisks `**bold text**`, double underscores `__bold text__`, or a combination of both. A parser needs to handle all these variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags like italics, strikethroughs, or links. The parser must distinguish between outer and inner formatting to extract only the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores used in a different context might be escaped with backslashes to prevent them from being treated as formatting markers (`\\**not bold\\**`). The parser should ignore escaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **Literal Code Blocks**: Text within inline code (backticks `` ` ``) or fenced code blocks (triple backticks ``` ``` ```) should not be parsed as formatted text since these are meant to display literal text, including any asterisks or underscores.\n\n5. **Incorrect Formatting**: Users might make mistakes in the Markdown syntax, such as uneven pairs of asterisks or underscores, which could lead to incorrect parsing if the parser strictly follows the formatting rules.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Asterisks or underscores within the URLs of links or images might complicate parsing, as they should not be treated as formatting delimiters.\n\n7. **Text Across Multiple Lines**: Bold text that spans multiple lines might create challenges if the parser is designed to work on a per-line basis instead of dealing with the full context.\n\n8. **Performance Concerns**: For large Markdown files, the efficiency of the parsing algorithm could become a concern, impacting the performance of extraction.\n\nA robust Markdown parser will need to handle these scenarios correctly to ensure accurate extraction of bold texts. Now let's proceed to see the input file so I can provide you with the correct answer."
