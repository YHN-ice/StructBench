We need to identify which ones are considered as image files.\n\n3. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes links can be confused with images if not properly parsed, as they have similar syntax. For instance, `[link text](URL)` for links and `![alt text](image_url)` for images.\n\n4. **Different File Extensions**: There might be different image formats such as .jpg, .png, .gif, etc., and the parser needs to recognize all of them.\n\n5. **Inline HTML**: Sometimes images are embedded using inline HTML within a Markdown file. These could be missed if the parser only looks for Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Filenames may include characters that are escaped in Markdown which could complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Broken Syntax**: If the Markdown syntax is not followed correctly (like missing brackets or parentheses), it may be more difficult to identify image files.\n\nGiven these challenges, the parser should be prepared to handle various syntactical scenarios and edge cases to accurately extract all image file names."
