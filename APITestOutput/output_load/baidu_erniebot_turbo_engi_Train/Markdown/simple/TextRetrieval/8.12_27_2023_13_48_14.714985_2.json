However, there might be variations or incorrect usages that could complicate extraction.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute URLs**: Image references could be either relative or absolute paths. Extracting just the filename might require additional logic to handle different path structures.\n\n3. **Link References**: Images can also be referred to by link references in Markdown, which separates the URL from the image markdown. This can make it harder to extract the image filenames directly.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also include HTML tags. If an image is included with an `<img>` tag rather than Markdown syntax, it would need to be parsed differently.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Special characters in Markdown may be escaped, such as a backslash before a parenthesis or bracket, which can alter the expected syntax for image inclusion.\n\n6. **Images in Code Blocks or Quotes**: Images that appear within code blocks or blockquotes should not be treated as actual images to extract since they aren't rendered as part of the document's content.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There could be multiple images included on a single line, so the parser must be able to handle multiple extractions from a single line of text.\n\nNow, I'm ready to see the input file and start extracting the image filenames."
