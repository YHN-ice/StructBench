In Markdown, images are typically embedded using the following syntax:\n\n```\n![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")\n```\n\nHere are a few potential obstacles and considerations:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: Markdown syntax for images can vary slightly. There may be spaces after the exclamation mark, before the parentheses, or between other elements. The parser must account for these variations.\n\n2. **Reference Style Images**: Markdown also allows reference-style image links, where the URL and title are defined elsewhere in the document. The parser needs to identify and resolve these references.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Markdown supports inline HTML, so images could also be embedded using the `<img>` HTML tag. The parser should recognize and extract such image files.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: If the image syntax contains escaped characters, the parser must interpret them correctly.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Text that looks similar to image syntax but isn't (such as a code block containing an example of the syntax) should not be incorrectly identified as an image.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: An image link might be nested within other Markdown elements, such as a list item or a table, which could complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Image URLs vs Filenames**: Extracting the exact file name might require parsing the URL and extracting the last segment if it's a path. Also, determining whether an image is local or hosted remotely (and thus only providing a URL) may be necessary.\n\n8. **Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions with additional or slightly different syntax for embedding images. The parser should be aware of the specific dialect of Markdown being used.\n\nTo accurately extract all image file names, the parser would need to handle all the above scenarios appropriately."
