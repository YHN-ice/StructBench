The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can contain other elements like links `[link](url)`, code spans `` `code` ``, or even other bold or italic markers. Extracting just the bold text without the nested elements might be required, which can be complex.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be escaped with a backslash to show the literal characters instead of making the text bold, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to recognize and properly handle escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incomplete Markers**: In some cases, there might be unmatched or incomplete markers for bold text, such as `**bold` without a closing `**`. The parser needs to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Inline vs. Block Elements**: Bold text can appear within paragraphs (inline) or as part of other block elements like list items, blockquotes, etc. The parser must be able to extract bold text from within these various contexts.\n\n6. **Whitespace Sensitivity**: Markdown processors may have specific rules about whitespace around bold markers. For instance, `**bold**` is different from `** bold **` in some processors, which may or may not render the latter as bold.\n\n7. **Multiple Bold Segments in Single Line**: There might be multiple bold texts in a single line, such as `**bold1** some text **bold2**`. The parser should detect and extract each bold segment separately.\n\nGiven these possible challenges, the parser needs to be robust and flexible to effectively extract all bold texts from a Markdown document."
