Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Variety in Image Syntax:** Markdown allows for images to be included using different syntax styles, such as:\n    - Inline image links: `![alt text](image.jpg)`\n    - Reference-style image links: `![alt text][image_ref]` followed by `[image_ref]: image.jpg`\n    - HTML tags (in some Markdown flavors): `<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" />`\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths:** Image paths can be relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs pointing to an external resource. Handling both types might be necessary.\n\n3. **Complex Paths:** File names can sometimes include spaces, special characters, or they may be part of a complex directory structure that needs to be correctly parsed.\n\n4. **Alt Text Similarities to File Names:** The alternative text for images (`alt text`) may contain strings that resemble file names and could potentially be confused with actual file paths.\n\n5. **Distractors in Code Blocks or Comments:** Images could be referenced inside code blocks or comments which are not meant to be parsed as actual images to display.\n\n6. **Link Definitions Separated from Usage:** For reference-style links, the definition of the link target might be far removed from the usage, which makes it trickier to associate and extract correctly.\n\n7. **Different File Extensions:** There are different file extensions for images (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.), and the parser needs to recognize all possible valid image extensions.\n\n8. **Markdown Flavors:** Different implementations of Markdown may have slight variations in how images are embedded which could affect parsing logic.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, we would need a robust parsing approach that can handle all these situations correctly to extract image file names from a Markdown document."
