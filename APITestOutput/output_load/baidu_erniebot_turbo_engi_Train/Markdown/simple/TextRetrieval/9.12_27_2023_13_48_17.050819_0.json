The parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links `[**text**](URL)` or italics `*italic **bold** italic*`. The parser should correctly ignore the surrounding formatting and only extract the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores within a Markdown file might be escaped with a backslash to display them as literal characters, e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`. The parser must distinguish between escaped characters and actual formatting.\n\n4. **Incorrectly paired symbols**: There might be cases where the bold syntax is not correctly closed, such as `**bold text`. The parser must decide whether to be strict with the syntax or to allow for some flexibility.\n\n5. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (indented by spaces or fenced by triple back-ticks) or inline code (surrounded by single back-ticks) should not be treated as formatted text. The parser must ignore these sections when extracting bold text.\n\n6. **Line breaks**: Depending on how the Markdown file handles line breaks within bold text (e.g., having a newline in the middle of bold syntax), the parser might need to handle multi-line bold text correctly.\n\nTo successfully extract all bold texts, the parser needs to account for these potential issues and apply the appropriate logic to handle each case correctly."
