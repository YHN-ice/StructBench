I need to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested emphasis**: Bold text can be nested within other formatting like italics, which could be denoted by single asterisks or underscores (e.g., `**bold and *italic* text**`). I would have to ensure that the extraction process accounts for nested formatting and extracts only the bold part correctly.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Asterisks and underscores can be escaped with a backslash (`\\`) to display them as literal characters rather than formatting (e.g., `**bold \\*not italic\\***`). I would have to distinguish between escaped characters and actual formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete syntax**: There could be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed (e.g., `**bold text`). Depending on the Markdown parser's strictness, this might not render as bold, and I would need to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n5. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser would need to handle line breaks correctly within bold sections.\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks) or inline code (enclosed by backticks) should not be interpreted as bold, even if it contains bold syntax characters.\n\n7. **Links and images**: Bold syntax within links or image alt-text should be considered differently because the bold might be part of the descriptive text for a link or image.\n\n8. **HTML tags in Markdown**: Some Markdown files may include HTML tags for formatting. If `<strong>` tags are used for bold text, these would also need to be accounted for.\n\n9. **Ambiguous delimiters**: Delimiters used for bold text might appear in other contexts, like in mathematical expressions or as bullet points, which are not meant to be formatted as bold.\n\nOnce I analyze the input Markdown file, I will apply strategies to handle these potential issues appropriately to extract the bold texts."
