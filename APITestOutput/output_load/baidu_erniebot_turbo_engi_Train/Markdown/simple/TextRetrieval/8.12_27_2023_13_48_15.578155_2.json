Each one needs to be accounted for.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: The file paths or URLs of images can vary. They might be absolute URLs, relative paths, or could even contain query parameters or fragments in the case of URLs.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, images are embedded in Markdown using HTML tags. This requires parsing HTML within Markdown to find image sources.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Text that looks like an image link but isn't (e.g., inside code blocks or comments) should not be counted as image files.\n\n5. **Link Definitions**: In reference-style image linking, the URL for the image is not present where the image is referenced but elsewhere in the document, which requires keeping track of link definitions and their usages.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, image syntax may contain escape characters that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n7. **Non-image Files**: Links to non-image files or external pages might be present and need to be distinguished from image file links.\n\n8. **Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown parsers support extensions that add additional ways to include images, which could potentially require additional parsing rules.\n\n9. **Nested Structures**: Markdown can have nested structures such as lists or blockquotes, within which images can be defined.\n\n10. **Performance**: If the Markdown file is very large, there might be performance considerations when parsing the file.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to carefully handle these potential issues to extract all the included image file names accurately."
