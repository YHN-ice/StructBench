Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise:\n\n1. **Variation in Markdown image syntax**: The standard Markdown syntax for images is `![Alt text](URL)` where \"URL\" can be a path to a file or a URL. However, variations in the syntax might include additional attributes or alternative formatting that can complicate the extraction.\n\n2. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using raw HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax. Extracting these would require parsing HTML as well.\n\n3. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: The image file paths might be relative to the location of the Markdown file or may be absolute paths. Tools parsing the Markdown need to extract the filename in either case.\n\n4. **Link references**: Markdown allows for images to be included via reference-style links, where the URL is not inline but rather defined elsewhere in the document. Identifying and resolving these references to extract the image filename may be more complex.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs or paths**: URLs or file paths might include special characters that are URL-encoded, which would need to be decoded to retrieve the correct file names.\n\n6. **Non-image file links**: The parser must distinguish between links to images and links to other types of files or web pages.\n\n7. **Markdown extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions that allow for more complex image handling, such as resizing, which could affect the syntax.\n\n8. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax may be escaped with a backslash to indicate they should be treated as literal characters, which could affect how the parser identifies image syntax.\n\n9. **Complex folder structures**: The path to an image file might involve navigating through a complex folder structure, and the parser must handle this correctly to extract the filename.\n\n10. **Markdown comments**: Some Markdown renderers support comments, which could contain image syntax that should not result in image extraction since it's commented out.\n\nTo handle these potential issues, the parser needs to be robust and flexible enough to handle all common variations of Markdown image syntax and edge cases."
