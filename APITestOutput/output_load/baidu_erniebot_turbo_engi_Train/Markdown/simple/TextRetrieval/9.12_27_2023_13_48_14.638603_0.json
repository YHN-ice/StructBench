The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` and double underscores `__bold text__`. A parser must handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text might be nested inside other formatting like italics, strikethroughs, or within links, which can complicate the parsing.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Asterisks or underscores that are meant to be displayed literally might be escaped with a backslash, which should not be confused with formatting.\n\n4. **False positives:** There might be patterns that resemble bold syntax but aren't meant for formatting. For instance, asterisks could be used in a list or underscores in a URL.\n\n5. **Incomplete syntax:** Sometimes the syntax might not be properly closed, with missing asterisks or underscores at the end, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code:** Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks or indented by four spaces) and inline code (wrapped in single backticks) should not be parsed for markdown formatting.\n\n7. **Line breaks:** Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser would need to handle line continuations appropriately.\n\n8. **Hyperlink text:** Bold text within the hyperlink description can be an added complexity since it can involve additional brackets and parentheses.\n\n9. **Performance:** Depending on the size of the input file and the complexity of the Markdown content, performance might be a concern with potentially multiple passes needed to accurately parse the content.\n\n10. **Edge cases and inconsistencies:** Markdown doesn't have a strict specification and different implementations may have slight variations in how they interpret the syntax. This can lead to inconsistencies when trying to parse for bold text.\n\nConsidering these challenges, it might require a careful approach to ensure that all bold texts are extracted accurately. If you can provide the input file or examples of Markdown content, I could attempt to parse it and extract the bold texts accordingly."
