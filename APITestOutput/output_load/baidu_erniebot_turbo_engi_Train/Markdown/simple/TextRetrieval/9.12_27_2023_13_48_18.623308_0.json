For example, some use double asterisks `**bold text**`, while others might use underscores `__bold text__`. This requires either knowing the specific flavor of Markdown in use or designing the parser to handle multiple possibilities.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text in Markdown can have nested formatting, such as italic, strikethrough, or inline code. This means the parser needs to be careful when looking for the bold markers not to be confused by other formatting markers. For example:\n   ```\n   **This text is _italic_ and bold**\n   ```\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax for bold can be escaped to show the literal asterisks or underscores, rather than applying formatting. The parser needs to recognize escaped sequences and not treat them as formatting. For example:\n   ```\n   \\**Not bold text\\**\n   ```\n\n4. **False Positives**: Asterisks and underscores are used for other purposes than just bold formatting, such as bulleted lists or as wildcards in some programming contexts. The parser should be able to distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: In some Markdown flavors, line breaks can impact whether text is rendered as bold or not. The parser may need to consider line breaks and inline spaces when identifying bold text.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Bold syntax can overlap with the syntax for links and images, which could potentially confuse the parser. For example:\n   ```\n   **![Image Description](image-url)**\n   ```\n\n7. **Incomplete Markers**: There might be instances where the formatting is not correctly closed, such as `**bold text`, which could cause issues when trying to extract the bold text.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, the parser will need to be robust enough to handle different scenarios accurately when extracting bold text from a Markdown file."
