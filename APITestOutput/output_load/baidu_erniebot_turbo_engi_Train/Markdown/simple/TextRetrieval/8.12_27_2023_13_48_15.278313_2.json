However, users may not always follow the exact syntax, so the parser must be able to recognize variations.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked using both relative and absolute paths. The parser must be able to extract both types of paths correctly.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Sometimes, images are embedded using raw HTML tags (e.g., `<img src=\"filename.jpg\">`) within the Markdown file. The parser might need to handle such cases.\n\n4. **Link References**: Markdown allows for link references, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document. The parser must resolve these references to extract the correct filename.\n\n5. **Non-image Links**: The presence of non-image links (regular hyperlinks) could be confusing for the parser, which should differentiate between image files and other types of links.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: In some Markdown files, characters within the image syntax may be escaped (e.g., `!\\[Alt text\\]\\(URL \"Optional title\"\\)`). The parser must handle escape characters appropriately.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Not all image URLs may end with traditional image extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), especially if they are linked to image hosting services or have tracking parameters appended. The parser must recognize these as images.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on the Same Line**: If multiple images are placed on the same line, the parser must extract each image filename separately.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, and the parser must still extract the filenames correctly in such scenarios.\n\n10. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors or extensions might add additional ways to include images, which may not conform to standard Markdown syntax.\n\nRecognizing and addressing these obstacles will be critical for accurately extracting image filenames from a given Markdown document."
