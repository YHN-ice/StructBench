The parser needs to recognize all possible notations.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags, such as italic (`*` or `_`), strikethrough (`~~`), or hyperlinks. It's necessary to ensure that the bold parsing logic can handle nested scenarios without breaking.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores could be escaped with a backslash to show the literal character instead of applying formatting (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incorrectly formatted text**: There might be instances where the Markdown syntax is not correctly followed (e.g., mismatched or unbalanced markers like `**bold*` or `**bold**text`), which can cause parsing issues.\n\n5. **Flanking whitespace**: According to some Markdown parsers' specifications, bold syntax requires non-whitespace characters immediately inside the asterisks/underscores. This means `** bold **` would not render as bold, but `**bold**` would.\n\n6. **Code blocks and inline code**: Text within code blocks (fenced with ````` or indented with four spaces) and inline code (delimited by backticks `` ` ``) should not be parsed as formatted text.\n\n7. **Handling multiple instances**: The file may contain multiple instances of bold text, and the parser needs to extract each instance separately.\n\n8. **Contextual interpretation**: The parser might need to understand the context of certain markdown files where specific conventions apply, such as when a set of asterisks or underscores is used for purposes other than formatting.\n\nThe parser must be designed to handle these situations correctly to successfully extract all bold texts from a given Markdown file."
