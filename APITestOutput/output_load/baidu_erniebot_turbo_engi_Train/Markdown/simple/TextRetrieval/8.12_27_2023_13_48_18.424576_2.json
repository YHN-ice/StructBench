In Markdown, an image is typically included using the following syntax:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](URL_or_path_to_image \"Optional title\")\n```\n\nSome potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process include:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: Markdown supports a few variations in the image syntax, such as omitting the alt text or title, or using reference-style links. We need to account for these variations.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be either relative to the Markdown file or absolute URLs. We need to extract both types without confusion.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using inline HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: If the Markdown file contains escaped image syntax (e.g., `\\![Not an image](#)`), it should not be treated as an actual image.\n\n5. **Links that are not images**: We need to distinguish between regular links and image links. A regular link in Markdown looks similar to an image link but without the preceding exclamation mark.\n\n6. **Complex File Names**: The names of image files might contain spaces, special characters, or parentheses, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. **Nested Content**: There might be nested content or other Markdown elements on the same line as the image syntax, which could make regex-based extraction more challenging.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on One Line**: Sometimes, a Markdown file may include multiple images on a single line, which requires identifying and extracting each one separately.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we can apply a strategy to deal with these potential issues and correctly extract all included image file names."
