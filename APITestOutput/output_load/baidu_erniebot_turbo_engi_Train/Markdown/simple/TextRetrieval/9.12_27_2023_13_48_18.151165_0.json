Markdown typically uses either double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`) to enclose bold text. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise:\n\n1. **Variations in syntax**: Users might use different ways to denote bold text, such as double asterisks or double underscores, and even mixing both in a single document. A parser needs to handle all these cases.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags like italic, strikethrough, or even within links, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or underscores might be escaped using a backslash (`\\`) to avoid formatting, in which case they should not be interpreted as bold syntax.\n\n4. **Inline code or code blocks**: Text within inline code (enclosed by backticks) or code blocks should not be interpreted as formatted text, even if it contains double asterisks or underscores.\n\n5. **Incomplete or incorrect syntax**: Users might forget to close the bold syntax properly, or there could be typos which would lead to the parser not recognizing the bold text correctly.\n\n6. **Adjacent formatting tags**: There could be no space between bold syntax and other formatting tags or punctuation, which needs careful handling to avoid incorrect parsing.\n\n7. **Multiline bold text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser needs to correctly identify and extract it, keeping in mind that traditional Markdown does not support multiline formatting without specific line breaks.\n\nThe parser must be equipped to handle these situations to accurately extract all the bold texts from the given Markdown input. Once the input file is provided, we can proceed with identifying and extracting the bold texts accordingly."
