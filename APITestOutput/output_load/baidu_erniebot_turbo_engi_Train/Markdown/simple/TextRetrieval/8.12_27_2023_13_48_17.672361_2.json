The regular Markdown syntax for images is as follows:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](URL_or_path_to_image \"Optional title\")\n```\n\nHere are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: Markdown supports various ways to include images. Some might use different alt text or omit it; some might include titles, while others won't. Additionally, reference-style image links could be used instead of inline links.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be referenced by absolute URLs (such as `http://example.com/image.jpg`), relative file paths (`images/image.jpg`), or even encoded data URLs (base64 encoded images within the document). Identifying file names in relative paths would be straightforward, but it would not apply to absolute URLs or data URLs.\n\n3. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors extend the basic syntax to add more features. For example, GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) has its own syntax for certain elements which could potentially alter how images are included.\n\n4. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes links and images can be formatted similarly in Markdown (`[text](URL)` for links and `![text](URL)` for images). Ensuring that only images are extracted and not hyperlinks requires distinguishing between the two.\n\n5. **Image Titles**: Optional titles in image syntax could contain spaces and special characters, which must be correctly parsed to avoid including them in the file name.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, characters within the Markdown syntax may be escaped (e.g., `\\!` instead of `!`), which would require careful parsing to handle correctly.\n\n7. **Inline HTML**: Images could also be embedded using raw HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax. This would necessitate parsing HTML within the Markdown file to find the image sources.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we'll need to carefully parse it considering the above difficulties to accurately extract all image file names."
