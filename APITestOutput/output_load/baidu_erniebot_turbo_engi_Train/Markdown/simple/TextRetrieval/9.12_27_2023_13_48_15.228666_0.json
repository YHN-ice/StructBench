For example, some use double asterisks `**bold**` while others use double underscores `__bold__`. It's important to know which flavor of Markdown we're dealing with to parse it correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Markdown Elements:**\n   Bold text in Markdown can contain other markdown elements like links `[**bold link**](url)`, italicized text `**bold *italic***`, or even code spans ``**bold `code`**``. Extracting just the bold text without any nested markdown can be tricky.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:**\n   Asterisks and underscores that are meant to be displayed literally rather than as markup can be escaped with a backslash `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser needs to recognize and handle these escaped characters correctly.\n\n4. **Incomplete or Incorrect Syntax:**\n   If the markdown is incorrectly formatted (e.g., only one asterisk `*bold*` in a flavor that requires two for bolding or missing closing tags `**bold`), it may not be clear whether the text should be interpreted as bold.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Whitespace:**\n   Line breaks and whitespace may complicate the parsing, especially if they come between the asterisks/underscores and the text. The parser needs to correctly handle these cases.\n\n6. **Code Blocks:**\n   Text within code blocks should not be parsed as formatted text, but sometimes bold syntax may appear within a code block. The parser must distinguish between code blocks and regular text.\n   \nOnce we have the input file, we'll need to apply a parsing strategy that takes these potential issues into account to accurately extract all bold texts."
