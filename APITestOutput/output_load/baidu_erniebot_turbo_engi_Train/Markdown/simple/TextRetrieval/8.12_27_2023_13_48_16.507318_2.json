The parser must handle all such variations.\n\n2. **Image URLs vs local files:** The image source might be a URL or a local file path. The parser needs to distinguish between them if only local file names are desired.\n\n3. **Complex Markdown elements:** Images might be nested within other elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which adds complexity to the parsing logic.\n\n4. **Alt text confusion:** The alt text of an image might contain parentheses or brackets which could be mistaken for the image syntax markers.\n\n5. **Escaped characters:** Markdown allows escaping of special characters. An escaped image syntax character shouldn't be mistaken for an actual image syntax.\n\n6. **Link vs Image distinction:** In Markdown, links and images have similar syntax with only a small distinction (`!`). The parser needs to correctly distinguish between them.\n\n7. **File name extraction:** If the image source is a local file path, it may contain directory paths that need to be stripped out to get just the file name.\n\n8. **Multiple images on a single line:** Multiple images may be included on a single line, requiring the parser to handle this without mistakenly merging the information.\n\n9. **Invalid or broken image syntax:** The Markdown file could contain errors or non-standard syntax which the parser needs to handle gracefully.\n\nTo correctly extract just the image file names, a robust parsing strategy needs to address these potential issues."
