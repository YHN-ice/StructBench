Generally, in Markdown, images are included using the following syntax:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")\n```\n\n- `Alt text` is the alternative text attribute for the image.\n- `URL` is the path to the image file which could be a relative path, an absolute path, or a URL.\n- `Optional title` is an optional attribute where you can add a title for the image.\n\nHere are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise while trying to extract image filenames:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: While the basic syntax is usually consistent, there may be variations such as spaces between elements or the use of different quotation marks.\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be relative to the Markdown file or absolute paths pointing to an external location. This might complicate the process if we need to resolve the paths.\n3. **Image Links vs Embedded Images**: Markdown also allows linking to images rather than embedding them directly. We need to ensure we identify embedded images, not links.\n4. **Different Markdown Flavors**: There are various flavors of Markdown (like GitHub-Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.) with slight differences in syntax that could affect parsing.\n5. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using inline HTML tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n6. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax could include escaped characters that need to be handled appropriately.\n7. **Multiple Images in a Single Line**: There might be more than one image on a single line, which requires parsing each one individually.\n\nTo handle these challenges, we would need to establish a robust regex or parsing strategy that can accommodate these variations and correctly identify all the image filenames in the given Markdown file."
