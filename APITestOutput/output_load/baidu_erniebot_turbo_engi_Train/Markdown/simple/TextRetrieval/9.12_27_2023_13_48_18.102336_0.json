The parser must recognize all the syntax patterns used for bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Formats:**\n   - Bold text could also be nested within other formats such as italics, strikethrough, or even within links or code blocks. The parser needs to be able to discern only the bold text without being confused by other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:**\n   - Sometimes, asterisks or underscores that are meant to represent bold text might be escaped using a backslash to display them as literal characters instead. This means the parser should ignore escaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Paired Delimiters:**\n   - There might be instances where the formatting delimiters are not correctly paired, leading to confusion about whether the text was intended to be bold or not.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and White Space:**\n   - White space and line breaks can affect how bold markdown is parsed since some markdown parsers require that the bold formatting delimiters are on the same line as the text being formatted.\n\n6. **False Positives:**\n   - Sometimes, the bold syntax might appear in text blocks where it is not intended to format text, like in code blocks or inline code snippets where it should be treated as plain text.\n\nThe parser must handle these cases to extract the bold texts accurately."
