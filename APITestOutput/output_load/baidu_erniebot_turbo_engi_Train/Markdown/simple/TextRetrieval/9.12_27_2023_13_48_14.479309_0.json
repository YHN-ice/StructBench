We should be able to handle both of these common cases.\n\n2. **Inline vs. Standalone Bold**: Bold text could be found standalone in a line or inline with other text. We need to make sure to extract bold texts that are part of a larger sentence or paragraph.\n\n3. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Bold text might contain other Markdown elements, such as links or italics. We will need to determine if we're only interested in the text itself or if we should also preserve the nested Markdown formatting.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape asterisks or underscores to prevent them from being parsed as Markdown (e.g., by using a backslash: \\**not bold\\**). We need to recognize and properly handle escaped formatting characters.\n\n5. **False Positives**: There may be instances where double asterisks or underscores do not signify bold text (e.g., mathematical contexts or within code blocks), so we should avoid extracting these as false positives.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Segments on One Line**: A line could have more than one segment of bold text. We should be ready to capture all occurrences and not just the first one we encounter.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Text**: While less common, it's technically possible to have bold text that spans multiple lines. The parser needs to be able to handle multiline bold sections if they are present.\n\nBy keeping these potential issues in mind, we can attempt to parse the Markdown file more accurately and extract the bold texts as required."
