Different syntax might be used for including images, and the parser must handle all of them.\n\n2. **Path Variability**: Image paths can be absolute URLs, relative to the Markdown file, or even embedded as base64 encoded data. The parser must discern which of these are actual file paths that it can list.\n\n3. **Link Confusion**: The parser must distinguish between image links and regular hyperlinks, as their syntax can be quite similar in Markdown.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, file names or URLs can contain escape characters that the parser must correctly interpret.\n\n5. **Alt Text**: Markdown includes alternate text for images which is not part of the file name. The parser should ignore this text when extracting file names.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, and the parser needs to correctly navigate such structures.\n\n7. **Comments or Disabled Markdown**: Sometimes Markdown files contain comments or intentional misuse of syntax to prevent rendering (e.g., by escaping characters). The parser should ignore these false positives.\n\n8. **File Extensions**: The parser needs to consider a variety of image file extensions such as .jpg, .png, .gif, etc., when extracting image file names.\n\nAfter you provide the input file, I'll be able to proceed with parsing it and extracting the image file names according to these considerations."
