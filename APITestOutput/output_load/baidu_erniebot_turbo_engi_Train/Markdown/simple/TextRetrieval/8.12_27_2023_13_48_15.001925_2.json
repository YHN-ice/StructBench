The standard format is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but not all elements are always present. For example, alt text or title might be omitted.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image sources can be specified with either relative or absolute paths. Absolute paths might include URLs, which could be harder to distinguish from regular text or links.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain HTML tags, so images might be included using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n4. **Reference-style Links**: Images in Markdown can also be included using reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image tag but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes characters like `!` or `[` might be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as Markdown, which could lead to false negatives if not accounted for.\n\n6. **Nested Content**: Images could be nested within other elements, like lists or blockquotes, which might affect how the parser interprets the lines containing image syntax.\n\n7. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown parsers support non-standard extensions, which might include additional or alternative ways to embed images.\n\n8. **File Extensions**: It's important to recognize various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.) to correctly identify image files.\n\n9. **Links vs. Images**: Distinguishing between image syntax and link syntax is crucial since they are similar in Markdown (images are essentially links with an exclamation mark at the beginning).\n\n10. **Multiline Syntax**: In some cases, the image syntax might be broken up across multiple lines, especially when adhering to line length limits.\n\n11. **Document Complexity**: If the document is particularly large or complex, the parser's efficiency might become a concern.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues can help in creating a robust solution to accurately extract all image file names from a given Markdown file."
