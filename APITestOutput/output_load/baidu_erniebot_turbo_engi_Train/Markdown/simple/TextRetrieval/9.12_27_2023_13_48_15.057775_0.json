The parser must handle all variations.\n\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text might be nested inside other formatting elements like italics, links, or code blocks. For example, `**bold _and italic_**` or `[**link with bold text**](URL)`. The parser needs to correctly identify the bold text without being confused by surrounding elements.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Markdown allows escaping special characters by preceding them with a backslash `\\`, so `**` could be included in the text without making it bold by writing `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should not treat escaped bold syntax as actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete formatting:** There may be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed, like `**bold text`. Depending on the implementation, this might be considered as bold or not.\n\n5. **Code blocks:** Text within code blocks should not be formatted, so any bold syntax (`**text**`) inside code blocks (indented or fenced by ```) should be ignored.\n\n6. **Incorrectly paired delimiters:** If the delimiters are not correctly paired or if there are extra spaces, such as `** bold**` or `**bold **`, Markdown may not render the text as bold, and the parser would need to decide whether to consider these as bold or not.\n\n7. **Line breaks:** Bold text might be split across multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle line breaks appropriately within the bold syntax.\n\n8. **Lists and blockquotes:** Bold text might appear within lists or blockquotes. The parser should be able to handle these cases without confusing the list or blockquote syntax with bold formatting.\n\nEach of these issues could affect how the parser identifies and extracts bold text from a Markdown file. The parser will need to be designed with these potential challenges in mind to ensure accurate extraction of all bold texts."
