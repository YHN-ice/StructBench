The parser must handle both scenarios.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might have nested elements such as links `[**bold link**](URL)`, italicized text `**_bold and italic_**`, or even code blocks `**`code`**`. The parser should be able to extract the bold text while ignoring or properly handling the nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Escaped asterisks or underscores might not denote bold text, such as `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser must differentiate between escaped and unescaped characters.\n\n4. **Inline Bold**: Bold text can occur in the middle of a sentence or paragraph without being on its own line. The parser should detect these instances.\n\n5. **Incorrect Formatting**: Some Markdown files might have incorrect formatting that is intended to be bold but isn't rendered as such due to mistakes, like missing one asterisk in `**bold*`. The parser may need to decide whether to be strict with syntax or attempt to interpret the author's intent.\n\n6. **Whitespace Handling**: Extraneous whitespace inside the bold syntax could affect whether the text is parsed as bold (`** bold **` vs `**bold**`).\n\n7. **Overlapping Formatting**: In some cases, formatting can overlap, such as when one bold section ends and another begins (`**bold1****bold2**`). The parser needs to handle these without mistakenly combining them into one bold section.\n\n8. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Bold syntax within code blocks and inline code should not be considered bold text since Markdown formatting is typically ignored within code sections.\n\nTo properly extract all bold texts, the parser must account for these complexities and correctly interpret the Markdown syntax. Now, with these potential issues in mind, I can proceed to extract the bold texts once you provide the input file."
