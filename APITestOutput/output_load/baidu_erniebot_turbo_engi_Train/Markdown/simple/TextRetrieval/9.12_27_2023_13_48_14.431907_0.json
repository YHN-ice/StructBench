All these variations need to be accounted for.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italics, struck-through text, or inline code blocks. Distinguishing pure bold text from nested formatting can be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes the bold syntax characters might be escaped to show literal asterisks or underscores in the text, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be mistaken for actual bold text.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, especially in the case of multiline paragraphs or lists.\n\n5. **False Positives**: There might be asterisks or underscores used in the text for purposes other than bold formatting, like in mathematical expressions or as bullet points in lists.\n\n6. **Contextual Use**: The bold syntax might be used in code blocks or inline code where it does not signify bold text but is part of the code syntax itself.\n\n7. **Partial Matches**: Part of the text could be mistakenly identified as bold if the parser does not correctly identify the start and end of the bold syntax.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the Markdown is not consistently formatted, it might have unmatched or incorrectly nested formatting symbols, making it hard to parse correctly.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, the parser will need to handle all these cases correctly. If I'm provided with a sample Markdown input, I can demonstrate how to extract bold texts while considering these potential issues."
