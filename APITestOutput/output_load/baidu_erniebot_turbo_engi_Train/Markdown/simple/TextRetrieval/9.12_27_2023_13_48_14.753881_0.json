I need to be able to recognize both.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested inside other formatting elements like italic, links, or even other bold tags. I need to correctly identify only the bold text without including other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows for escaping formatting characters using a backslash, like `\\**not bold\\**`. These should not be treated as bold text.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks using backticks `` ` `` should not be considered, even if they contain what looks like bold syntax.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Similar to inline code blocks, code blocks that are indented or fenced with triple backticks should be ignored.\n\n6. **Partial Formatting**: Sometimes, the formatting may not be correctly applied due to missing or unmatched formatting symbols, e.g., `**bold`. These should not be treated as formatted text unless the Markdown renderer would do so.\n\n7. **HTML Tags**: Some Markdown renderers allow HTML tags, so bold could also be indicated by `<b>` or `<strong>`. These may need to be recognized depending on the context of the question.\n\n8. **Lists and Blockquotes**: Bold text might be within lists or blockquotes, and the parser needs to identify these correctly without including list or blockquote markers.\n\n9. **Line Breaks**: The parser should correctly handle bold text that spans multiple lines or has line breaks within it.\n\n10. **Ambiguity in Parsing**: Without a clear definition of what constitutes 'bold' in the context of this task (does it include nested formats or not?), there could be ambiguity in the expected results.\n\nAssuming we're looking for strictly the text that is marked as bold according to standard Markdown conventions (using `**` or `__`), I will need to carefully process the input file while considering these potential complexities."
