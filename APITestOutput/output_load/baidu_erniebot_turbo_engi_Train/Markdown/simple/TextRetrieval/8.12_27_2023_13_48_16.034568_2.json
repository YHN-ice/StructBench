We'll need to be prepared to handle all common variations.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using HTML tags (e.g., `<img src=\"image.jpg\" />`). These would need to be parsed separately from the typical Markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be included using either relative paths (e.g., `images/picture.jpg`) or absolute URLs (e.g., `https://example.com/image.jpg`). We should decide whether to list both types or only local files.\n\n4. **Links with Title Attributes**: Markdown allows for optional title attributes which can add complexity to the image syntax (e.g., `![alt text](image.jpg \"Title\")`).\n\n5. **False Positives**: There might be text that looks like an image link but isn't, such as code blocks or inline code that contains image-like syntax. We'll need to ensure these aren't mistakenly extracted.\n\n6. **Nested Markdown Elements**: In some cases, image links could be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes, and we need to make sure these are still detected correctly.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: In Markdown, characters can be escaped to prevent them from being parsed as special characters (e.g., `\\![Not an image](#)`). We need to account for these instances so we don't extract them as image filenames.\n\n8. **Image URLs with Query Strings or Fragments**: Image sources might contain query strings or fragments (e.g., `image.jpg?size=1024`, `image.jpg#section`). We should decide how to handle these parts in our extraction.\n\nWe'll need to tackle these challenges systematically to ensure accurate extraction of all image filenames from the provided Markdown file."
