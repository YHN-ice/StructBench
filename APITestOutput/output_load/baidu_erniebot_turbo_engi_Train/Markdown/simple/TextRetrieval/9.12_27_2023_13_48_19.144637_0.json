The parser must recognize all the syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Bold text may contain other Markdown elements like links `[link](url)`, inline code `` `code` ``, or even other bold or italic markers. The parser needs to handle such nested elements properly.\n\n3. **Escaped Bold Markers**: Sometimes, the bold markers might be escaped with a backslash to show the asterisks or underscores literally, e.g., `\\*\\*not bold\\*\\*`. The parser must distinguish between actual bold text and escaped markers.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Paired Markers**: There might be cases where the bold markers are not correctly paired, such as `**bold` or `bold**`. Deciding how to handle these cases can be challenging.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Text that looks like bold syntax but isn't intended to be bold (e.g., in code blocks, where `**` should be interpreted literally) should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to correctly identify and extract such multiline bold sections.\n\n7. **Handling Edge Cases**: Situations like bold text directly followed by punctuation without spaces (e.g., `**bold**.`) or bold markers within words (e.g., `wo**rd**`) could present additional challenges in accurately identifying bold text.\n\nFor a comprehensive extraction, the parser needs to address these potential issues effectively."
