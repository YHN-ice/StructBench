Handling nested formatting might require a more complex parsing strategy.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the markdown syntax characters with a backslash (`\\`) to display them as literals instead of having them render as formatting. This should be taken into account to avoid false positives.\n\n3. **False Positives**: There could be instances where double asterisks or underscores don't actually denote bold text but are used in different contexts (e.g., in code blocks or for other purposes).\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might use an inconsistent style for bolding text (mixing asterisks and underscores), or they might not close the bold formatting properly, leading to ambiguities in what is considered bold.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Markdown allows for bold text to span across multiple lines, so the parser must be able to handle multiline patterns.\n\n6. **Different Markdown Flavors**: There are different flavors of Markdown (like GitHub Flavored Markdown, CommonMark, etc.), and each might have slightly different rules for what constitutes bold text.\n\n7. **Other Delimiters**: Depending on the Markdown flavor, other delimiters (like triple asterisks or specific HTML tags) might also be used for bold formatting.\n\n8. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown document is very large, performance considerations might come into play when parsing the text.\n\n9. **Ambiguity with Headers**: In some Markdown flavors, lines starting with one or more hashes (#) are considered headers. If a header is not correctly spaced from the bold syntax, it may lead to confusion whether the content is a header or bold text.\n\nTo ensure the correct extraction of bold texts, the parser will need to handle these potential issues appropriately."
