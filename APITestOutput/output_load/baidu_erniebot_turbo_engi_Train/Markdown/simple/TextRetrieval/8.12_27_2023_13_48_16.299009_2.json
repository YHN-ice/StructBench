We need to ensure we correctly identify this pattern to extract image file names.\n\n2. **Variations in Image Path**: Images in Markdown files can be linked with absolute or relative paths, and can include various directories or subdirectories. Some might also have query parameters or fragments which should not be considered part of the file name.\n\n3. **Handling Different File Extensions**: Image files can have different extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). The parser needs to recognize and handle various image formats.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Occasionally, Markdown files may contain embedded HTML for more complex image embedding. This can include `<img>` tags with `src` attributes.\n\n5. **Multiple Images on One Line**: Sometimes, multiple images may be included on a single line, so the parser should handle this scenario without merging file names.\n\n6. **Links That Are Not Images**: Not all links (URLs in parentheses) are image links, so we need a way to distinguish between image links and other types of links.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: The Markdown syntax might include escaped characters that could be mistaken as part of the file name or path.\n\n8. **Incorrect Markdown Syntax**: If the Markdown syntax is not correctly followed (missing brackets, parentheses), it could lead to incorrect parsing of file names.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, we must carefully read through the given Markdown input to ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
