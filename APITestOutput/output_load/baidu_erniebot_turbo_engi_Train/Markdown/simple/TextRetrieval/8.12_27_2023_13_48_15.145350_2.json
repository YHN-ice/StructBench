However, there could be variations or errors in the syntax that can complicate extraction.\n\n2. **Inline vs Reference-style Images**: Markdown allows images to be included inline with the text or using reference-style links where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document. Both styles need to be accounted for.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image source paths can be either relative to the document or absolute URLs. The extraction process should be able to handle both.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files may include images using raw HTML `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax. This could be missed if only looking for Markdown image syntax.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: URLs for images might be URL-encoded, which can make it more difficult to extract and present in a human-readable format.\n\n6. **Linked Images**: Sometimes images are wrapped within a link, which adds another layer of syntax around the image syntax.\n\n7. **Incorrect Formatting**: Human errors in formatting could lead to images not rendering and being harder to detect, such as missing parentheses, brackets, or incorrect nesting.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, characters that are part of Markdown syntax might be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as such, potentially complicating the parsing.\n\n9. **Non-Image Links**: We need to differentiate between image links and other types of links (like links to web pages) to avoid false positives.\n\n10. **Image Titles and Alt Text**: The alt text or title for an image could contain parentheses or other characters that might be mistaken for part of the URL.\n\n11. **Textual Noise**: There might be non-image-related text or syntax elements interspersed between image links that need to be ignored.\n\n12. **File Extensions**: Images could have different file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser should recognize all common image formats.\n\nAddressing these difficulties requires careful consideration and robust pattern matching, possibly incorporating regular expressions and a thorough understanding of Markdown syntax and its common deviations."
