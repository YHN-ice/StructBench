In Markdown, images are typically included using the following syntax:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](URL \"Optional title\")\n```\n\nwhere `URL` is the path to the image file. Depending on how the Markdown document is structured, we may face several challenges:\n\n1. **Variations in Markdown Image Syntax**: The basic syntax could vary slightly; for example, some Markdown dialects may not use the \"Alt text\" or \"Optional title\", or they may allow additional attributes.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The URL to the image could be a relative path, an absolute path, or a URL to an external resource. We'll need to identify which ones are file names we can extract.\n\n3. **Reference-style Images**: Images might be included using reference-style links, where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n4. **Inline HTML**: Markdown allows for inline HTML, so images could be included with `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Text that resembles the image syntax but isn't actually an image (for example, an incorrect syntax or a commented-out line) should be ignored.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: The image syntax might include escaped characters that need to be properly interpreted.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There may be lines with more than one image included; we'll need to parse each one separately.\n\n8. **Non-standard Extensions**: Some Markdown parsers support non-standard extensions that modify how images are included.\n\nIdentifying and overcoming these obstacles will be key to accurately extracting all image file names from the provided Markdown document."
