Ensuring that the parser recognizes all variations is important.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths:** Image links might be given with absolute URLs or relative paths. The parser needs to differentiate between these and extract only the file names if required.\n\n3. **Embedded Links:** Sometimes images are embedded within links. The parser must be able to recognize and extract the image file names even when they are nested within link syntax.\n\n4. **Special Characters:** File names could contain special characters or spaces that might throw off a simple parsing logic.\n\n5. **Image References:** In Markdown, images can also be referenced elsewhere in the document, and the actual URL might be placed at the bottom of the document. This requires keeping track of references and matching them to their URLs.\n\n6. **Non-Image Files:** Ensuring that only image files are extracted and non-image files (like .md or .txt linked in a similar manner) are ignored.\n\n7. **Alt Text Complexity:** The alternative text for images (`![Alt text]`) can sometimes contain complex elements like other markdown or special characters that could confuse the parser.\n\n8. **False Positives:** There might be false positives where something looks like an image link but isn't, for example, code blocks or inline code snippets that contain text resembling Markdown image syntax.\n\n9. **Multiple Images on One Line:** There may be multiple images on a single line, so the parser must be able to handle this without missing any images.\n\n10. **Nested Markdown Elements:** Images might be nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes, which can complicate extraction.\n\nOnce we have the input file, these are some of the things we may need to lookout for to accurately extract and list all the image file names."
