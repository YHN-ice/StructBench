In Markdown, bold text can be indicated in a few different ways, typically using pairs of asterisks `**` or underscores `__` before and after the text.\n\nHere are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Different Syntax for Bold**: As mentioned, Markdown supports `**text**` or `__text__` for bold. The parser must handle both cases.\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might be within other elements like links (`[**bold text**](url)`) or nested with italics (`***bold and italic***`), which complicates extraction.\n3. **Escaped Characters**: The presence of escaped characters like `\\**not bold\\**` should be handled correctly as they do not constitute bold text.\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users may not consistently use Markdown syntax (e.g., `**bold __text**`), which might be challenging to parse correctly.\n5. **Partial Markers**: Lines with incomplete markers for bold like `**bold` or `bold**` that might be mistakes but could be confused by the parser as bold text.\n6. **Code Blocks or Inline Code**: Bold markers within code blocks (indented by four spaces, fenced by triple backticks ` ``` `) or inline code (surrounded by backticks ` `) should not be considered as bold text.\n\nThe parser must discern and handle these cases properly to ensure only proper bold text is extracted.
