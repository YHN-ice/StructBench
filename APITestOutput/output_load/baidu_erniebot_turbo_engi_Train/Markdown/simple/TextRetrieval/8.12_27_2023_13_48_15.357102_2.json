It's important to handle all the variations.\n\n2. **Link Confusion**: Sometimes links can be confused with images because they have a similar syntax. An image starts with an exclamation mark (`!`), unlike a link, which does not.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: There could be escaped characters or Markdown characters within file names or alt text that might complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be either relative or absolute. Relative paths may not include a domain or could start with a `.`, `..` or a `/`, while absolute paths might include a full URL, making the parsing logic more complex.\n\n5. **HTML embedded images**: Markdown allows embedding raw HTML, and thus images might be embedded using `<img>` tags instead of Markdown syntax.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: While most image files will have common extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., there could be many other valid image file extensions that need to be accounted for while extracting the file names.\n\n7. **Title Text and Attributes**: The title text or other attributes in the image Markdown or HTML tags could contain misleading information such as periods or parentheses that could be mistaken as part of the file name.\n\n8. **Comments or Strikethrough**: Markdown comments or strikethrough syntax might contain what looks like image syntax but is actually not rendered as an image.\n\n9. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be nested inside other elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which might make the regex or parsing logic more complex.\n\n10. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Images split across lines or with unconventional whitespace usage might be missed by simple regex patterns.\n\n11. **Markdown Variants**: Different flavors of Markdown might have slightly different rules regarding how images are embedded.\n\nFor accurate extraction, the parser needs to be robust against these potential issues and capable of distinguishing actual image syntax from false positives."
