Handling each type correctly is necessary to extract only the file names.\n\n3. **Alternate Text Interference**: The alternative text for images (`![alt text]`) might include brackets or parentheses that could be confused with the actual syntax for embedding images.\n\n4. **Nested Markdown Elements**: An image link could be within another Markdown element, like a list item, a blockquote, or nested within other text which could complicate parsing.\n\n5. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown flavors (like GitHub Flavored Markdown) have extensions for handling images that don't follow the original Markdown specification.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Escape characters might be used to display literal brackets or parentheses which should not be interpreted as part of the image syntax.\n\n7. **Links vs Images**: Distinguishing between image syntax and link syntax, since they are similar in Markdown (links are `[text](url)` while images are `![alt text](image-path)`).\n\n8. **Capturing only the image file name**: The path might include directories or other elements, and you're interested in just the file name.\n\n9. **File Extension Recognition**: Not all images will necessarily have standard image extensions (like .jpg or .png), so recognizing an image could involve more than just looking for a typical extension.\n\nPreparing for these potential difficulties can help ensure a more accurate and comprehensive approach to parsing and extracting image file names from a given Markdown file."
