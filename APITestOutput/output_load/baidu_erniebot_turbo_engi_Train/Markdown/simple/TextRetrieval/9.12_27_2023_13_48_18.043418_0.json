For instance, text can be made bold by wrapping it with `**` or `__`. The parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold syntax might be nested within other formatting elements, like links (`[]()`), italicized text (`*` or `_`), or strikethroughs (`~~`). The parser must recognize bold text within these contexts without being confused by the surrounding syntax.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users can escape the bold syntax characters (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`) to prevent them from being parsed as formatting. The parser needs to differentiate between escaped and unescaped formatting characters.\n\n4. **Text Spanning Multiple Lines**: In some Markdown processors, bold text can span multiple lines if the delimiters are properly placed at the end of one line and the start of the next. This requires the parser to recognize multiline patterns.\n\n5. **Incorrect Markdown Syntax**: Users may make mistakes in their Markdown syntax (e.g., `**bold*`, `***bold**`). Deciding how to handle incorrect syntax could affect the output.\n\n6. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (indented with four spaces, fenced with `` ``` ``, or inline with backticks) should not be parsed as formatted text. The parser must ignore bold syntax within code contexts.\n\n7. **Link Labels**: In Markdown, link reference labels might resemble bold syntax (e.g., `[**label**]: url`). The parser needs to distinguish between actual bold text and link label definitions.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to develop a strategy that addresses these potential issues to accurately extract all bold texts."
