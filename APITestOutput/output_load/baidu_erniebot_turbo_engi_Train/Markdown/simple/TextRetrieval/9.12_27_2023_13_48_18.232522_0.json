The most common are double asterisks `**bold text**` and double underscores `__bold text__`. The parser must recognize both.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis**: Bold text can be nested within other elements such as italic, strikethrough, or links. For example, **_italic and bold_**. The parser must be able to handle and correctly extract bold text within such cases.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash to avoid formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser should not consider these as bold.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: There might be edge cases where the bold syntax is broken by new lines, punctuation, or incorrect pairing of asterisks or underscores. The parser should be designed to handle these appropriately.\n\n5. **Incomplete Markers**: Bold markers might be incomplete or unbalanced, such as `**bold` without the closing `**`. The parser needs to decide how to handle these.\n\n6. **Code Blocks**: Text within code blocks should not be parsed for formatting. The parser needs to distinguish between code blocks (indented with four spaces or wrapped in `` ``` ``) and regular text.\n\n7. **False Positives**: There could be instances where asterisks or underscores are used in a context that is not meant for bold formatting (e.g., in mathematical expressions or bullet lists).\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, the parser must have a robust pattern matching strategy and context understanding to accurately extract only the intended bold-formatted text."
