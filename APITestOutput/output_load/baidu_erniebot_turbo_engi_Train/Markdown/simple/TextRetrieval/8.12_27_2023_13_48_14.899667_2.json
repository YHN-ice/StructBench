When parsing Markdown to extract all included image files, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Variety of Image Syntax**: Markdown supports multiple ways to include images. The most common is the `![Alt text](URL)` format, but there could be variations or shortcuts used by different Markdown flavors.\n\n2. **Reference-style Images**: Images in Markdown can also be added using reference-style links where the URL is provided elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Inline HTML**: Some Markdown files might include images using inline HTML tags (`<img src=\"URL\" alt=\"Alt text\" />`) which requires different parsing logic.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be linked with absolute URLs or with relative paths to the file system. The parser must differentiate between these to extract file names correctly.\n\n5. **Encoded URLs**: URLs might be percent-encoded, especially if they contain spaces or special characters, which would need to be decoded to get the correct file name.\n\n6. **Link vs. Image Confusion**: Links and images have a similar syntax in Markdown. An image is prefixed with an exclamation mark (`!`), but if this is missing, it could be mistaken for a regular link.\n\n7. **Nested Markdown**: Sometimes, image syntax could be nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes, which may complicate extraction.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: If the image syntax includes escaped characters (`\\`), the parser must handle these appropriately to avoid extracting incorrect information.\n\n9. **Comments and Metadata**: Some Markdown files include comments or metadata that may contain image-like syntax which should not be extracted as it's not part of the main content.\n\n10. **File Extensions**: It's necessary to consider that image files come with various extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`), and the parser needs to account for these variations when extracting file names.\n\nThese are just a few of the potential challenges one might face when parsing a Markdown file to extract image file names.
