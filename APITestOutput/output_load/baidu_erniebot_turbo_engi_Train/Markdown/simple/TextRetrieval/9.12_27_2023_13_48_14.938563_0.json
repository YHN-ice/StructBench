The parser must be able to recognize both formats.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might have other elements nested inside, such as links `[**bold and linked text**](URL)`, or italics `**_bold and italic text_**`. The parser needs to be able to extract the bold text while handling or ignoring nested elements as required.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the markdown syntax to prevent formatting, for example `**not bold\\*\\*`. A parser should recognize escaped characters and not treat them as formatting.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Paired Markers**: There could be errors in the Markdown file where the bold markers are not correctly paired, like `**bold text`. The parser has to decide how to handle these cases—ignore, partially extract, or mark as an error.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ``` or indented by four spaces) or inline code (encased in single backticks `) should not be processed for Markdown formatting. Bold markers within these should be treated as literal text.\n\n6. **Markdown Flavors**: Different platforms and parsers support different flavors of Markdown with subtle differences in how bold text is parsed and displayed. The parser must know which flavor it is dealing with.\n\n7. **Overlapping Formatting**: There may be cases of overlapping format markers, like `**bold __bold and italic__ bold**`, which could complicate parsing.\n\nThe parser needs to account for these potential issues to correctly identify and extract all bold texts from the given Markdown file."
