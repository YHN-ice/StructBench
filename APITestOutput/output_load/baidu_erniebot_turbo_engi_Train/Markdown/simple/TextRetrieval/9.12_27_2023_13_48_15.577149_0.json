For example, text can be made bold using a pair of double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__). Both `**bold text**` and `__bold text__` are considered valid. The parser must handle all possible syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold markup can contain other Markdown elements, such as links `[**bold link text**](URL)`. The parser must accurately extract the bold text while ignoring or properly handling nested elements.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the bold syntax to prevent it from being parsed, like \\**not bold\\** or \\__not bold\\__. The parser should not consider escaped sequences as bold.\n\n4. **Inline Bold**: Bold text might appear inline with other text, like so: \"This is **bold** text.\" The parser must correctly identify and extract just the bold portion of the line.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold syntax might span multiple lines, which could be tricky to handle if the parser is designed to work on a single line basis.\n\n6. **Incorrectly Paired Markers**: Users might use an incorrect number of markers, such as `***bold* text**` or `**bold text***`. The parser has to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n7. **Adjacent Bold Elements**: There could be adjacent bold elements with no space between them, like `**bold****text**`. The parser needs to separate these into distinct bold texts.\n\n8. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Text within code blocks (delimited by triple backticks ``` or indents) and inline code (delimited by single backticks `) should not be parsed as bold even if they contain bold syntax.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, the parsing algorithm needs to account for these challenges and apply the appropriate logic to handle them, ensuring that only correctly formatted bold text is extracted from the Markdown file."
