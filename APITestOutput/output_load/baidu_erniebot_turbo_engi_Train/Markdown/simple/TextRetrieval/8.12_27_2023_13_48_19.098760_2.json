I need to identify both types and extract the relevant file names, which might require different handling.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown supports inline HTML, so images may be embedded using `<img>` tags instead of the usual `![]()` syntax.\n\n4. **Reference-style Links**: Images might be included using reference-style links, where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: In some cases, the image syntax might include escaped characters that need to be correctly interpreted to identify the file name.\n\n6. **Non-image Links**: It's possible to encounter links to files that aren't images, which should not be mistaken for image files.\n\n7. **Multiple Images in One Line**: There might be lines with multiple images, and each image file needs to be identified separately.\n\n8. **Different File Extensions**: Image files can have various extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and all possible extensions should be recognized.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parsing logic must be robust enough to handle various cases and accurately extract all image file names from the Markdown content provided."
