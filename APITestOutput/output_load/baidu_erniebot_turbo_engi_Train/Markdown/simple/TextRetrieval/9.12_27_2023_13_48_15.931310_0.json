The parser needs to handle all possible syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested Bold Text**: Sometimes, bold text can be nested within other formatting like italics, or even within other bold text. For example, `**this is _very_ important**`. The parser must correctly identify the outermost bold without being confused by the nested formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Markdown allows for escaping formatting characters using a backslash `\\`, so `**bold\\**` would not actually be bold text. The parser needs to recognize and properly handle escaped characters.\n\n4. **Incorrectly Paired Delimiters**: There may be instances where the formatting delimiters are not correctly paired, such as `**bold text`. The parser must decide how to handle these cases, whether to ignore them or to attempt to make an educated guess about the author's intent.\n\n5. **Code Blocks**: Bold syntax within code blocks should not be interpreted as bold text, because it's meant to show code or commands exactly as written. For example, ```` ``` **Not Bold** ``` ```` should not be extracted as bold.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Markdown syntax for links and images may contain asterisks or underscores that could be misinterpreted as bold formatting.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: The parser needs to handle line breaks correctly, as some Markdown renderers may allow bold formatting to span multiple lines, while others may not.\n\nConsidering these challenges, the parser must be robust enough to differentiate between actual bold text and false positives caused by Markdown's flexible syntax rules. Now, please provide the input file so I may attempt to extract the bold texts."
