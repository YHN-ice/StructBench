In Markdown, bold text is typically indicated by surrounding the text with two asterisks `**` or two underscores `__` before and after the text. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. Variations in Syntax: Markdown has a couple of different ways to denote bold text (`**` and `__`). The parser must handle all variations.\n\n2. Nested Formatting: Bold syntax might be nested within other formatting tags like italics, strikethrough, or links, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. Escaped Characters: Asterisks or underscores used as literals rather than formatting marks (escaped with backslashes) should not be mistaken for bold syntax.\n\n4. Incomplete Markers: There may be instances where the markers are not properly paired (e.g., an opening `**` without a closing `**`), which might lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n5. Multiline Bold Text: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to correctly identify and extract such cases.\n\n6. Code Blocks: Text within code blocks or inline code (denoted by backticks `) should not be parsed as bold since Markdown syntax is not processed inside code blocks.\n\n7. Lists, Headers, Blockquotes: Bold syntax within other Markdown elements (like lists, headers, blockquotes) might need special handling to ensure accurate extraction.\n\nHandling these cases requires a robust Markdown parser that can accurately determine the context and apply Markdown rules correctly to extract bold text."
