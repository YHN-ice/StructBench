However, users might use variations or incorrect syntax which can make it trickier to accurately parse all image references.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Image sources can be either relative paths or absolute URLs. A parser must be prepared to handle both, and when providing just the filenames, the parser must be able to extract the filename from a full path or URL.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown files can also contain raw HTML. If an image is included with an HTML `<img>` tag instead of Markdown syntax, it needs to be detected and handled separately.\n\n4. **Reference-style images**: Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but rather defined elsewhere in the document. Identifying and resolving these references might be necessary.\n\n5. **Escaped characters**: Filenames or URLs might contain escaped characters that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n6. **Non-image links**: Ensuring that only image files are extracted, and not other file types or links that are not images.\n\n7. **Text in square brackets**: Text within square brackets is not always an image, it could be a link or just text. The parser needs to differentiate between these cases.\n\n8. **Images within lists or blockquotes**: Parsing logic should ensure that images are correctly extracted even when they are nested within other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes.\n\n9. **Capturing all alt text**: While alt text is not typically a filename, a parser should be able to capture it if necessary without confusion.\n\n10. **File extension checks**: It's important to identify and extract only image files, which would generally have extensions like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. Other file types should be ignored.\n\n11. **Handling duplicates**: There may be multiple references to the same image file that should either be listed once or accounted for each time they appear.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, the parser must be carefully designed to handle a variety of cases to ensure accurate extraction of all image filenames."
