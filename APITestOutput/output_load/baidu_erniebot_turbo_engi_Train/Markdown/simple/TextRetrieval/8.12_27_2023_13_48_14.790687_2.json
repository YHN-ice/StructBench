The typical Markdown image syntax looks like this:\n\n```markdown\n![alt text](image-file-path)\n```\n\nThe potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process could include:\n\n1. Variations in Markdown syntax: There are different flavors of Markdown, and the syntax might have slight variations. For example, some may use additional attributes or different ways to specify the image size or alignment.\n\n2. Inline images vs referenced images: Markdown allows for images to be included inline (with the path directly in the image syntax) or as references (where the path is defined elsewhere in the document). We will need to handle both cases.\n\n3. Image URLs vs file paths: Images can be included from local file paths or from URLs. If we're only looking for file names, we'll need to differentiate between URLs and local file paths.\n\n4. Alternative text and titles: The alternative text or titles for images might include parentheses or brackets, which could complicate the extraction of the file name if not handled correctly.\n\n5. Non-image files: Ensure that we're only extracting image files and not other file types that might also be included in the Markdown file (e.g., links to PDFs or other non-image files).\n\n6. Escaped characters: Markdown syntax allows for characters to be escaped to avoid them being processed as Markdown, which could affect how we parse the lines.\n\n7. Multiple images in a single line: There might be multiple images in a single line, so our approach should account for this possibility.\n\nTo accurately extract image file names, the parser must be able to address these potential issues."
