Different Markdown Syntax: Images can be included using different Markdown syntax, such as `![alt text](image-url)` or reference-style links. The parser must account for these variations.\n\n2. Relative vs Absolute Paths: Image paths can be absolute URLs or relative paths to files within a project. The parser should extract the file names irrespective of the path type.\n\n3. Image URLs with Parameters: Some image URLs might contain query parameters (e.g., `![alt text](image-url?size=50)`). The parser needs to extract the file name without the query parameters if present.\n\n4. Multiple Images on the Same Line: Markdown allows for multiple images to be placed on the same line. The parser must be able to identify and extract each image file name separately.\n\n5. Nested Markdown: Images could be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or blockquotes. The parser should be able to parse these correctly.\n\n6. Non-image Files: Sometimes, non-image files like documents or archives may use similar syntax. The parser needs to differentiate between image and non-image files, possibly based on common image file extensions such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.\n\n7. Incorrect Markdown Syntax: The Markdown file may contain errors or non-standard syntax, which could lead to false positives or negatives in file extraction.\n\n8. Alt Text Variations: Alt text can vary greatly and may include special characters or markdown formatting, which should not affect the image file name extraction.\n\nThe parser will need to navigate these issues to accurately identify and list the image file names used in the Markdown document."
