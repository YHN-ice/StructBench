Commonly, bold text in Markdown is represented using either a pair of double asterisks `**text**` or a pair of double underscores `__text__`. \n\nHere are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting inside it, like italics, code snippets, or even links, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or underscores used within text for non-formatting purposes might be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`), which should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Sometimes, the bold syntax may not be used consistently (e.g., one asterisk on one side and two on the other), which could lead to missed instances of bold text.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which means the parser would need to handle line breaks within bold text correctly.\n\n5. **Confusing Syntax**: Other Markdown elements like headings or list items can also use asterisks or underscores, so distinguishing bold text from these elements can be tricky.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Punctuation**: Sometimes, punctuation marks can be attached directly to the formatting markers, which can introduce ambiguity (e.g., is `**text**.` bold with a period or just `**text**`?).\n\n7. **Partial Overlaps with Other Formats**: Part of a word or sentence might be bold while the rest is not, leading to partial formatting cases which are harder to detect.\n\n8. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**: Bold markers within code blocks or inline code should not be treated as bold text, so the parser needs to be aware of the code syntax.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will apply the necessary logic to extract only the bold texts considering these potential issues."
