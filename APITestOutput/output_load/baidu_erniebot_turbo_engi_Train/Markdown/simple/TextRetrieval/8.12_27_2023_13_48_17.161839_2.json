The most common is `![Alt text](URL)` but there can be variations or shortcuts provided by specific Markdown flavors or extensions, which could make parsing more complex.\n\n2. **Reference-style links**: Markdown allows for reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the image syntax but rather defined elsewhere in the document. Identifying and linking these references correctly can be challenging.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Some Markdown files might include HTML tags directly, and images can be included using `<img>` tags with various attributes.\n\n4. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image file paths can be relative or absolute. Relative paths might not indicate the full location of the image file without additional context about the document's location.\n\n5. **Non-standard characters**: Filenames with spaces, special characters, or non-Latin characters could complicate extraction.\n\n6. **Linking to non-image files**: The presence of links that are not to image files but use similar syntax (like linking to a `.pdf` or `.html` file) might lead to false positives.\n\n7. **Nested content**: There might be nested content or other Markdown elements like lists or blockquotes within which image links are present, which could complicate parsing.\n\n8. **Escaped characters**: Characters that are part of Markdown syntax might be escaped to prevent them from being processed, so the parser needs to handle escaped characters correctly.\n\n9. **Comments**: Markdown does not officially support comments, but they can be included using HTML comment syntax (`<!-- -->`). If image links are within comments, they should not be considered as included images.\n\n10. **Broken syntax**: Sometimes Markdown syntax might be broken or incomplete, which could lead to images not being rendered and thus harder to detect by a parser.\n\nEach of these potential issues requires careful consideration when developing a robust Markdown file parser to ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
