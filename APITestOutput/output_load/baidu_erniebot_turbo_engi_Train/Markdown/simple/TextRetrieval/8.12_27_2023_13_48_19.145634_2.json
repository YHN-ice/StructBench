When parsing a Markdown file for image files, we might encounter several difficulties and obstacles such as:\n\n1. **Different Markdown image syntaxes**: Markdown supports images with a syntax that generally looks like `![Alt text](URL)`, but variations could exist, such as reference-style image links or images with additional attributes (like title).\n\n2. **Inline vs. reference images**: Some images may be included inline with the direct link, while others might use reference links where the URL is defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n3. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Images can have either relative paths (like `./images/pic.jpg`) or absolute paths (like `https://example.com/image.png`). We need to identify them regardless of the path type.\n\n4. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown can embed HTML, and images can be included using `<img>` tags rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n5. **File name vs. file path**: Some Markdown files might not include the full file name but rather a path, and it's necessary to parse out the actual file name.\n\n6. **Escaped characters**: Sometimes, image syntax could be escaped to prevent rendering (e.g., `\\![Not an image](/path/to/file)`), which shouldn't be counted as an image.\n\n7. **Non-image URL**: It's important not to confuse image URLs with other types of URLs that might lead to resources different than image files (like `.html` or `.pdf`).\n\n8. **False positives**: Text that may look like markdown image syntax but isn't intended to be an image, such as when used in code blocks or examples.\n\nTo extract all the included image files correctly, we'll need to account for these potential difficulties and ensure our method can handle the various ways images might be presented in the Markdown content. Could you please provide the input file or the relevant content to proceed with extracting the image file names?"
