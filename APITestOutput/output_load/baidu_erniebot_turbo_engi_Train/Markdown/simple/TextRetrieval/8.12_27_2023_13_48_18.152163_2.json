The parser needs to handle both styles.\n\n2. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images can come in various formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF). The parser should be able to recognize all common formats.\n\n3. **Invalid Image References**: Some image references might be incorrectly formatted. The parser should be resilient to such errors and skip them or handle them gracefully.\n\n4. **Images Hosted Externally**: Images in Markdown could be hosted externally (i.e., the image URL points to a web address). Determining the filename from the URL might require URL parsing logic.\n\n5. **Images with Same Name but Different Directories**: There could be images with the same name located in different directories. The parser should preserve the directory structure in the file names to avoid ambiguity.\n\n6. **Escaped Image Syntax**: Sometimes, the Markdown syntax for images could be escaped to show the literal characters rather than rendering an image. The parser should recognize and ignore these instances.\n\n7. **Complex Markdown Structures**: Images could be nested within other Markdown elements, like lists or tables, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\nPlease provide the input Markdown file so that I can proceed with extracting the image filenames."
