We need to account for both possibilities.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can sometimes contain other Markdown elements like links, italics, or even inline code. Parsing out just the bold text while ignoring nested elements could be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, the asterisks or underscores used for bold markup might be escaped with a backslash to display them literally, which means they shouldn't be treated as markup.\n\n4. **Partial Matches**: There could be cases where the asterisks or underscores are not evenly paired, leading to partial matches that aren't actually bold text.\n\n5. **Inline Text**: Bold markers could be within a line of text rather than on their own line, meaning that the parser must be able to identify bold text within a larger string.\n\n6. **Multiple Bold Sections**: If there are multiple bold sections in one line or in consecutive lines, the parser must extract each section separately.\n\n7. **Incorrect Syntax**: Users sometimes make mistakes in their markup. The parser might need to decide whether to be strict with Markdown syntax or allow slight deviations.\n\nThe process will involve identifying the appropriate patterns that denote bold text in Markdown and extracting the content between these markers, ensuring that we only capture the intended text and deal with any of the complexities mentioned above."
