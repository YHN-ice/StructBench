Commonly, `**text**` or `__text__` are used. Ensuring that the parser accounts for both could be a challenge.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text might be nested within other elements like links `[text](url)`, or italicized text `*text*` or `_text_`. Parsing out just the bold text while maintaining the integrity of the rest of the content would need careful handling.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape the bold syntax to display the asterisks or underscores literally, like `**text\\**` or `__text\\__`. The parser should recognize and not treat escaped characters as formatting.\n\n4. **Inline Code Blocks**: Text within inline code blocks using backticks `` `code` `` should not be parsed as bold even if it contains bold syntax.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Fenced Code Blocks**: Multi-line code blocks indented with four spaces, or fenced by triple backticks (```) or tildes (~~~), should be ignored when parsing for bold text.\n\n6. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes users forget to close the bold markers, resulting in something like `**text`. It needs to be decided whether this should be treated as bold or not.\n\n7. **Other Markdown Elements**: Lists, headers, blockquotes, and other Markdown elements might contain bold text. The parser will need to traverse these correctly to extract the bold parts.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Markdown Renderers**: Different Markdown renderers can interpret the same Markdown differently. Some may be stricter in syntax than others.\n\n9. **Performance Issues**: If the Markdown file is very large, performance might become an issue, and the parser would need to be optimized to handle large inputs efficiently.\n\nNow that we've considered potential issues, please provide the input file so that I can attempt to extract all bold texts for you."
