Typically, bold text is denoted by double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` on either side of the text, but there might be variations.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting Conflicts:** Bold formatting might be nested within other formatting, like italics, links, or code blocks. We have to ensure we only parse bold text and not get confused with other inline styling.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes, asterisks or underscores are escaped with a backslash to display them literally. We'll need to distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters that are not meant for formatting.\n\n4. **Incomplete Formatting:** There may be mistakes in the Markdown where the bold formatting is not properly closed with a second set of asterisks or underscores.\n\n5. **Multiple Bold Sections on One Line:** There could be multiple bold sections within a single line, and we need to make sure we capture all of them.\n\n6. **Whitespace Handling:** Some Markdown processors allow for whitespace between the asterisks/underscores and the text for bold formatting. We'll need to decide if we consider that as bold or not.\n\n7. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks (indented with spaces or surrounded by triple backticks) and inline code (surrounded by single backticks) should not be parsed for formatting. We'll need to ignore these sections when looking for bold text.\n\n8. **Links and Images:** The syntax for links and images also uses brackets and parentheses, which could be confused with formatting if not handled correctly.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will attempt to parse it considering the above challenges to extract all bold texts."
