The most common syntax for embedding images is `![Alt text](URL)` where \"Alt text\" is the alternative text for the image if it can't be displayed, and \"URL\" is the link to the image file. Given this, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Variations in Syntax**: There could be variations in the syntax, such as spaces between the brackets and parentheses, or the use of different quote types for URLs.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image URLs can be either relative to the location of the Markdown file or absolute paths including the domain name. Extracting just the file names when given an absolute path might require additional processing.\n\n3. **Different Image Hosts or Protocols**: Images might be hosted on different domains or accessible through different protocols (http, https), which could complicate the extraction of a clean file name.\n\n4. **Reference-style Images**: Markdown also allows for reference-style image links, where the URL is not inline but rather defined elsewhere in the document. Recognizing and resolving these references may pose a challenge.\n\n5. **Link within an Image**: Sometimes, images are clickable and wrapped within a link. This means there could be nested Markdown syntax to parse.\n\n6. **Encoded URLs**: Some image URLs might be URL-encoded, especially if they contain special characters, which would necessitate decoding to get the proper file name.\n\n7. **Non-Image Files**: There might be links to non-image files mistakenly taken as images if only the syntax is considered without verifying the file type.\n\n8. **Markdown Extensions or HTML Tags**: Some Markdown processors support extensions or even raw HTML tags that could be used to include images in non-standard ways.\n\n9. **Comments or Disabled Syntax**: Parts of the Markdown might be commented out or use disabled syntax that should not be considered when extracting images.\n\n10. **File Name Special Characters**: Special characters in file names (like spaces, parentheses, etc.) might complicate the extraction process and require careful consideration.\n\nEach of these potential issues requires careful consideration when designing a robust Markdown file parser to extract image file names accurately."
