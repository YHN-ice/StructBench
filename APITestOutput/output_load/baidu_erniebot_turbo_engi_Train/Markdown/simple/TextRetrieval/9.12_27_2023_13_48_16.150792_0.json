The most common syntax is double asterisks (`**bold text**`) or double underscores (`__bold text__`). Parsing must handle all variations.\n\n2. **Nested Elements**: Bold text can have nested elements like links, italics, or code spans. The parser must be able to distinguish between the bold markers and other Markdown syntax within the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Bold markers might be escaped with a backslash (`\\`), meaning they are not meant to be parsed as Markdown but as literal characters. The parser must handle escaped characters properly.\n\n4. **Inline vs. Block Elements**: Bold text can appear within paragraphs, lists, headers, and other block-level elements. The parser needs to recognize bold text within any context.\n\n5. **Incomplete Markers**: Sometimes, a document could have unmatched bold markers which are not intended to create bold text. The parser should ideally handle such cases gracefully, perhaps by ignoring them or flagging them as errors.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser must be able to handle line breaks within bold sections without breaking the syntax.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we'll need to account for these potential difficulties in order to accurately extract all the bold text."
