Both need to be identified correctly.\n\n4. **Text Similar to Image Syntax**: Sometimes there's text that looks like image syntax but isn't, such as code blocks or inline code that contains examples of Markdown.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The parser must handle syntax errors gracefully, such as missing parentheses, brackets, or alt text.\n\n6. **Embedded HTML**: Markdown may contain embedded HTML tags, including `<img>` tags, which should also be considered when extracting images.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: In Markdown, characters such as `!` or `[` can be escaped with a backslash to indicate they are not part of an image tag.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown**: Sometimes images are nested within other elements like lists or blockquotes, which may influence the extraction process.\n\nTo accurately extract all image file names, a parser would need to handle these cases correctly and robustly."
