The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but there could be variations or shorthand versions like `![Alt text](URL)` without a title or even reference-style links.\n\n2. **Inline HTML**: Markdown supports inline HTML, so an image could be included using an `<img>` tag rather than Markdown syntax.\n\n3. **Link Definitions**: Images in Markdown can be referenced using link definitions, which might be placed anywhere in the document. The parser must correctly associate the link reference with the URL.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: If the syntax for embedding an image is escaped (e.g., `!\\[Alt text](URL \"Title\")`), it should not be considered as an image.\n\n5. **Image URLs vs File Names**: The parser may need to differentiate between URLs pointing to online resources and actual file names for images that are supposed to be part of the document's assets.\n\n6. **Non-image URLs**: Not every link or URL in the Markdown document will point to an image file. The parser needs to ignore non-image links.\n\n7. **False Positives**: Text that coincidentally follows a pattern similar to Markdown image syntax but isn't intended to be an image (like code snippets, comments, or examples of Markdown usage) should not be counted as images.\n\n8. **Nested Markdown**: Images could be nested within other Markdown elements like lists, blockquotes, or tables, which could complicate parsing.\n\nBy anticipating these challenges, we will be better prepared to accurately extract image file names from the Markdown document you provide."
