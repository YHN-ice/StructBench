The most common one is `![Alt text](URL \"Title\")`, but variations might omit the alt text, title, or use reference-style links where the URL is not inline but defined elsewhere in the document.\n\n2. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, images or links can be escaped to prevent them from being rendered. For example, `\\![Not an image](/path/to/img.jpg)` should not be treated as an image.\n\n3. **Nested Markdown Elements**: Image links might be nested within other elements, like a list or a blockquote, and the parser needs to handle these cases correctly.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: The image source could be a relative path or an absolute URL. While this does not affect the extraction process, it could be relevant if further processing is required.\n\n5. **Non-standard Markdown Extensions**: Some Markdown processors support extensions that alter the standard syntax. This could introduce non-standard ways of embedding images.\n\n6. **Link References at Document End**: As mentioned earlier, some images may use reference-style links, which are defined at the end of the document. These must also be recognized and properly extracted.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be carefully designed to handle various cases and potential edge cases."
