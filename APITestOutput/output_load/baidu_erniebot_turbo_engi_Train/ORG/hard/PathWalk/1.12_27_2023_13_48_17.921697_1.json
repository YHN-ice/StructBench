Hierarchical Structure: ORG files are organized hierarchically with sections, subsections, subsubsections, etc. It's crucial to correctly navigate this structure to find the right content at the specified level.\n\n2. Consistent Formatting: The parser must rely on consistent formatting to determine the hierarchy level of headings. If the formatting is inconsistent or non-standard, it may be challenging to accurately identify the desired section.\n\n3. Nested Content: Subsections can contain complex content, including further nested subsections, lists, links, and various formatting elements. Extracting the exact content without losing context or important formatting details can be tricky.\n\n4. Text Encoding: The file encoding must be handled correctly to ensure that all characters are read and displayed properly.\n\n5. Error Handling: The parser should be prepared to handle errors gracefully, such as missing sections or unexpected file content.\n\n6. Ambiguous References: If the reference to the subsection or subsubsection is ambiguous or incorrectly numbered, it might be difficult to locate the exact content.\n\n7. File Size and Performance: If the ORG file is very large, performance considerations may come into play when parsing and extracting specific content.\n\n8.
