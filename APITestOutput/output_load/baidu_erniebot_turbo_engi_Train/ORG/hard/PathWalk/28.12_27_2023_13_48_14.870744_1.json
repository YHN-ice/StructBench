Hierarchical Structure: ORG files have a hierarchical structure with sections, subsections, and subsubsections, denoted by varying numbers of asterisks (*) in the headings. A parser must correctly identify the level of each heading to navigate to the correct part of the document.\n2. Non-Sequential Numbers: The numbering in the question (1st, 2nd, etc.) does not correlate directly with the number of asterisks used in ORG file headings as this is a human-friendly indexing. I will need to map this indexing to the correct heading levels within the ORG file.\n3. Inconsistent Formatting: If the ORG file is inconsistently formatted, such as missing asterisks or inconsistent indentation, it may be difficult to correctly identify the structure.\n4. Multiple Matches: There may be multiple subsections or subsubsections that seemingly fit the description \"1th subsubsection under 2th subsection under 2th section\". The parser must discern which one is being asked for based on accurate counting and hierarchy navigation.\n5. Content Identification: Once at the correct heading level, I must be able to extract not just the heading but also the associated content up until the next heading of the same or higher level.\n6. Ambiguities: The interpretation of \"1th\" instead of \"1st\" could introduce confusion, but it's assumed to be a typographical error and interpreted as \"first\".\n\nOnce I have access to the ORG file input, I could address these potential obstacles by implementing logic that correctly navigates and extracts the required information based on the hierarchical structure of the document."
