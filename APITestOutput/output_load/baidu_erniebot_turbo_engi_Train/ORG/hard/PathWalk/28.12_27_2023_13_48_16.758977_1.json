This requires interpreting the structure rather than relying on explicit numeric indicators.\n\n3. **Textual Variability**: The content within sections can vary significantly, including plain text, lists, links, code blocks, and more. Extracting the relevant content without missing any part of it could be challenging depending on how complex the content is.\n\n4. **File Size and Complexity**: If the ORG file is very large or complex, finding the correct section could be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n5. **Formatting Issues**: The format could contain additional elements or customizations such as tags, properties, and timestamps, which need to be correctly interpreted or filtered out according to the question's requirements.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the ORG file is not consistently formatted (e.g., inconsistent use of asterisks for headings), it would be harder to parse the document structure accurately.\n\n7. **Embedded Content**: If there is content embedded from other sources or includes dynamic elements like macros or scripts, it could complicate the extraction of plain text content.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the file has encoding issues or includes special characters that are not properly displayed, it might affect the parsing process.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles will help in preparing to parse the ORG file accurately and efficiently."
