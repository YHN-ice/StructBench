Identifying the correct level and position of the desired content requires proper parsing of headings and their levels, denoted by asterisks (*).\n\n2. **Consistent Labeling**: The sections, subsections, and subsubsections need to be consistently labeled for the parser to track the correct path. Any inconsistency in labeling could lead to confusion about which subsubsection is actually the \"2nd subsubsection under the 2nd subsection under the 2nd section.\"\n\n3. **Textual Content vs. Metadata**: An ORG file may contain metadata like TODOs, tags, properties, which may not be part of the actual content. Distinguishing between actual content and metadata is important when extracting the required text.\n\n4. **Embedded Content**: If there is content such as links, images, code blocks, or other embedded objects within the subsubsection, it needs to be handled according to its type and presented correctly in the output.\n\n5. **Formatting**: Preserving the original formatting such as lists, bold or italic text, and other formatting elements while presenting the content can be challenging but is crucial for correct representation.\n\n6. **Document State and Changes**: If there are dynamic parts of the document, such as timestamps or state changes (like TODO items being marked as DONE), this may affect the content retrieval if it changes the structure.\n\n7. **Multiple Documents or Large File Size**: If there are multiple ORG files or if the file is large, it could be challenging to manage and parse efficiently without a good strategy for handling data.\n\n8. **Nested Content**: There could be nested lists or tables within the subsubsection that need to be correctly identified and parsed.\n\n9. **External References**: The ORG file could contain references to external files or URLs which may not be relevant to the content but might be present in the text.\n\nIn order to address these potential obstacles, a parsing strategy needs to be well-structured and robust to accurately navigate through the ORG file's structure and extract the desired content faithfully."
