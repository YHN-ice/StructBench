Content Variability: The content within a section can include plain text, TODO lists, code blocks, tables, and more. The parser must handle all these elements correctly.\n\n4. Incomplete Structure: If the ORG file is not well-structured or if there are missing asterisks or inconsistent formatting, it could complicate the parsing task.\n\n5. File Size: A very large ORG file might require efficient parsing algorithms to quickly find and return the required section.\n\n6. Embedded Content: ORG files can include links, images, and other embedded content which might need special consideration when extracting text.\n\n7. Metadata: Sections can contain metadata like timestamps, tags, and properties.
