Nested Structure: ORG files have a hierarchical structure, which can sometimes get very nested. Identifying the correct level for sections, subsections, and sub-subsections requires careful parsing.\n\n2. Ambiguous Numbering: The numbering system (1th, 2th) is not standard. Normally, it would be \"1st\", \"2nd\", \"3rd\", etc. There might be confusion about what is meant by \"1th\", \"2th\", etc.\n\n3. Inconsistent Formatting: If the ORG file does not consistently use the same formatting for headings and subheadings (e.g., if it doesn't always use the correct number of asterisks to denote the hierarchy level), it may be difficult to accurately identify which content belongs to which section or subsection.\n\n4. Large File Size: If the ORG file is large, it might take some time to parse through the entire content to find the specific section requested.\n\n5. Embedded Content: ORG files can contain links, lists, tables, and other embedded elements that might complicate extracting plain text.\n\n6. Encoding and Special Characters: Depending on the file's encoding, there may be special characters or formatting that doesn't parse well into plain text.\n\n7. Variability in Content Presentation: The content under subsections might be presented in various ways such as prose, bullet points, or code blocks which could affect how the excerpt is extracted and presented.\n\nOnce we have access to the ORG file, we can work on finding the specific content requested and address these potential difficulties accordingly."
