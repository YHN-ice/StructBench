Identifying the correct level in the hierarchy can be challenging if not navigated correctly.\n\n2. **Ambiguity in Headings**: Sometimes ORG files may not follow a strict numbering system or headings might be ambiguous, which could make it tricky to determine what constitutes the \"1st subsection\" or \"1st subsubsection.\"\n\n3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the ORG file isn’t consistently formatted, it could be difficult to programmatically identify different sections, especially if the expected markers such as asterisks (*) for headings are missing or used inconsistently.\n\n4. **Embedded Content**: ORG files can contain links, lists, code blocks, or other content types embedded within sections. Extracting only the relevant text while preserving its structure could be complicated if the parser does not handle these content types correctly.\n\n5. **Large Size and Pagination**: If the ORG file is particularly large with many sections and subsections, it can be cumbersome to locate the correct part of the document efficiently.\n\n6. **Encoding and Character Set Issues**: If the file uses a non-standard encoding or contains special characters, it might cause issues with correctly parsing and displaying the content.\n\n7. **Access to the File**: As this is a text-based interaction without the ability to actually \"see\" files, I would need the content to be provided in the query text to answer questions about it.\n\nOnce I have access to the ORG file content, I would be able to parse through the text and structure to provide the content of the specified subsection."
