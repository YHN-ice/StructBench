Deciding how to handle this information could be a challenge.\n\n8. **File Size and Complexity**: Large files with many sections and subsections could pose performance issues or make it harder to locate specific content.\n\n9. **Error Handling**: The parser must be able to handle errors or inconsistencies in the file gracefully without crashing or providing incorrect information.\n\nIf I had access to the input file, these are some of the factors I would need to consider in order to provide an accurate answer to your request.
