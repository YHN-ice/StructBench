If the parser is expected to simulate this behavior, it must be capable of identifying and unfolding sections to access their content.\n\n10. **Special Blocks**: ORG files can include special blocks (quotes, examples, etc.), necessitating careful parsing to maintain the integrity of such blocks when extracting content.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, precise parsing rules need to be established, and the parser should be able to handle the hierarchical nature of the document along with any formatting intricacies."
