Properly identifying the 1st subsection within the 1st section requires correctly navigating this hierarchy.\n\n3. **Large file size**: If the ORG file is very large, it might be challenging to efficiently locate the desired subsection without parsing the entire file, which could be time-consuming.\n\n4. **Inconsistent numbering**: If the file uses custom or inconsistent numbering for sections and subsections, it may complicate identifying the \"1st\" of each without understanding the numbering scheme.\n\n5. **Embedded content**: There might be various types of content embedded within a section, such as code blocks, lists, or links. Ensuring that all related content is included while excluding unrelated content can be tricky.\n\n6. **External references**: The ORG file might reference external files or URLs that are not included in the text content, making it impossible to retrieve some context or information mentioned in the subsection.\n\n7. **File encoding**: If the file uses a non-standard or incompatible text encoding, reading and interpreting the contents might require additional steps to decode the file correctly.\n\nGiven an ORG file input, these issues would need to be addressed to accurately identify and extract the content of the specified subsection."
