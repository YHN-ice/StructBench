Nested Structure: ORG files have a hierarchical structure with sections, subsections, and subsubsections. Identifying the correct level in the hierarchy can be challenging.\n\n2. Similar Headings: There might be sections, subsections, or subsubsections with similar or identical headings which could lead to confusion.\n\n3. Inconsistent Numbering: Users might refer to sections by different numbering conventions (e.g., using \"1st\" instead of \"first\") or the numbering might be off due to preceding content not being taken into account.\n\n4. Ambiguity: The question may lack context or be ambiguous in terms of what is considered as part of the content (e.g., whether to include metadata, properties, or just the body text).\n\n5. Formatting: The ORG file might have special formatting that needs to be preserved in the output, such as lists, links, or code blocks.\n\n6. Errors in the ORG File: The ORG file itself might contain errors such as incomplete headings, incorrect indentations or missing content which could affect parsing.\n\n7. Multiple Files: If there are multiple ORG files or a very large ORG file, it may be difficult to quickly find the correct subsection without additional navigation or searching capabilities.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a good approach would involve systematically traversing the hierarchical structure of the ORG file, handling each heading and its associated content accurately, and taking note of any special formatting that must be preserved in the output."
