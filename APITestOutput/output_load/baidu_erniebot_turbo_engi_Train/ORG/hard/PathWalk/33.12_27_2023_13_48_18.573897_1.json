Text Formatting: ORG files support text formatting such as bold, italic, underlined, links, lists, etc., which might complicate extracting plain text.\n\n5. Large Files: If the ORG file is large, it might be challenging to process all the content quickly in order to find the specific subsubsection.\n\n6. Inconsistent Numbering: Users might refer to sections using different numbering systems or conventions, making it difficult to understand which \"2th section\" or \"1th subsection\" is being referred to.\n\n7. Incomplete Information: If there are missing headings or the file content is not well-organized, it might be difficult to parse accurately.\n\n8. Alternative Structures: ORG files can include other constructs like tables or code blocks that might be mistaken for regular content if not properly identified.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles can help us prepare strategies to deal with them when parsing the ORG file content."
