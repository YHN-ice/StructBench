The '2th' should be '2nd'. This could indicate a typo or unconventional numbering that needs to be accounted for.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the ORG file does not follow a consistent format, identifying the different sections and subsections could become difficult.\n\n5. **Large File Size**: If the ORG file is very large, it might be time-consuming to find the correct section, especially if this process cannot be automated.\n\n6. **Embedded Content**: Sections might contain links, code blocks, or embedded content that can complicate extraction of plain text.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, I would need to ensure that I parse the file accurately, respecting the hierarchical structure and utilizing any numbering or markers provided to identify sections, subsections, and subsubsections correctly.
