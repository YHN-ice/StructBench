Typically, asterisks (`*`) are used. The parser needs to correctly identify the pattern (e.g., `*bold text*`) and differentiate it from other uses of asterisks, such as bullet points or italic text.\n\n2. **Handling variations in syntax**: The markup for bold text might vary slightly. For example, there could be spaces after the opening asterisk or before the closing asterisk (`* bold text *`), which needs to be handled correctly.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting options, such as links, code blocks, or italic text. The parser must be able to extract the bold text without being thrown off by other formatting.\n\n4. **Escape characters**: Sometimes, asterisks are used in a non-formatting way, and are escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`). The parser should be able to recognize and ignore escaped formatting characters.\n\n5. **Line breaks and continuity**: Bold text might span multiple lines. The parser needs to maintain the continuity of the bold text when it crosses line boundaries.\n\n6. **Contextual processing**: The parser should know whether it's inside a block of bold text or not, taking into account that there could be multiple occurrences of bold text in the same paragraph or across different sections.\n\n7. **Error handling**: The parser needs to be robust enough to handle errors in the org file where the bold syntax isn't properly closed or is malformed.\n\n8. **Output formatting**: After identifying and extracting bold texts, they need to be presented in a clear and readable format, separated by a newline as specified. The parser should not introduce additional characters or formatting into the raw text output.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to carefully parse it considering these potential issues to extract all bold texts accurately."
