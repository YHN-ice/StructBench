To parse it correctly, a parser needs to understand the format and conventions used for linking or embedding images.\n\n2. **Link Variations**: Image files can be linked in various ways. They could be local files with a relative or absolute path, or they might be URLs to external resources. The parser must handle all these cases.\n\n3. **Different Link Syntaxes**: In ORG files, links can be plain text, or they might be within brackets with a descriptive part, e.g., `[[file:image.png][description]]`. The parser should be able to differentiate and extract the image filenames regardless of the link syntax.\n\n4. **Embedded Images vs. Linked Images**: Images might be embedded directly in the document as base64-encoded strings or linked as mentioned earlier. The parser should distinguish between these and extract the relevant information accordingly.\n\n5. **Non-Image File Links**: An ORG file might contain links to different file types, not just images. The parser needs to discern between image files (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and other file types.\n\n6. **Textual Noise**: There could be non-link text that resembles links or image filenames, possibly causing false positives if the parser is not careful.\n\n7. **Encoding and Characters**: Filenames might contain special characters or spaces, which could complicate the extraction process if not handled properly.\n\n8. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: It's possible to have multiple image links on a single line, which means the parser should not stop after finding the first one.\n\n9. **Invalid or Broken Links**: Some of the linked images might not exist or be accessible, which isn't directly a parsing issue but could lead to errors if the parser tries to verify the existence of each file.\n\nTo correctly extract all included image file names, the parsing algorithm would need to robustly address these issues."
