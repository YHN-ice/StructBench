Common difficulties and obstacles that might arise include:\n\n1. **Different Markup for Images**: ORG files can include images using various markup styles. If the file uses a non-standard way of embedding images, it might be more challenging to extract the file names.\n\n2. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images can be in various formats (e.g., jpg, png, gif). Ensuring all formats are captured requires knowing all possible image extensions that might be used.\n\n3. **Linked vs. Embedded Images**: Some images may be linked from external sources rather than embedded within the document. I would need to distinguish between the two and extract only those that are part of the document.\n\n4. **File Path Complexity**: Image file paths can be absolute, relative, or even contain spaces or special characters, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n5. **Image References Inside Other Elements**: Images could be included inside other markup elements like links or tables, which may require parsing these elements to find the image references.\n\n6. **Comments or Inactive Code**: The ORG file might contain commented-out sections or inactive code blocks that include image references which should not be considered as included images.\n\nTo address these issues, I would parse the ORG file's text content looking for patterns that match image inclusion, such as `[[file:image_name.extension]]` or links pointing to image files, and then list down the file names while taking care to handle the above challenges."
