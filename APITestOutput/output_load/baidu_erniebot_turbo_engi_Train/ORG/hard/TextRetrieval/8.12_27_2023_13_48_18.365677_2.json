The parser must differentiate these if only the displayed images are of interest.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: Not all image links may have a clear image file extension (like .jpg, .png, .gif), especially if the source is a URL, which might require content-type detection instead of simple pattern matching.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Links**: The ORG file could contain commented-out sections or inactive links that include image paths which should not be counted if we are only interested in active content.\n\n6. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images might be embedded directly in the ORG file using base64 encoding. The parser needs to identify and possibly decode such data if required to extract the file names.\n\n7. **Markup Complexity**: ORG files can contain complex markup, and links can be surrounded by additional markup which could complicate the parsing process.\n\n8. **Multiline Links**: If an ORG file breaks image links across multiple lines, the parser needs to handle line continuations to correctly extract the image link.\n\nOnce we have the input ORG file, we would need to carefully parse it to handle these potential obstacles to accurately extract all included image file names."
