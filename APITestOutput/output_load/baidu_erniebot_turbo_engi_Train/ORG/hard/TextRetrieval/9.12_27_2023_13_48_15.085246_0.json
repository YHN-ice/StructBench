Typically, bold text is demarcated by asterisks, like `*bold*`, but variations and whitespace issues could pose challenges.\n\n2. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which can complicate the parsing process as the parser needs to recognize multi-line bold text blocks.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be nested within other formatting elements like lists, headers, or italicized text. This requires the parser to handle nested structures appropriately.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as creating lists or section headings. The parser must distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n5. **Ambiguities**: Text that appears to be bold might not be intended as such if there are mismatches in asterisk pairs. Handling these ambiguities requires additional logic.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Markup**: Users may not always follow the exact markup rules, leading to inconsistencies like spaces between asterisks and the text that could make parsing difficult.\n\n7. **Escape Characters**: Characters like backslashes might be used to escape asterisks, meaning they should not be interpreted as markup, and the parser would need to account for this.\n\n8. **Mixed Content**: Bold text might include other elements like links, code snippets, or special characters that could complicate extraction.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser would need to have robust logic to handle different scenarios and edge cases accurately.
