Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process:\n\n1. **Variety of Image Formats:** Images can be in a variety of formats such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc. I need to be aware of all possible image formats that could be included.\n\n2. **Link Formatting:** ORG files may include links to images in different ways, such as using descriptive links `[[file:example.jpg][Description]]` or direct links `[[file:example.jpg]]`. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n3. **Relative vs Absolute Paths:** Images might be linked using relative paths or absolute paths. I must extract the filename regardless of the path type.\n\n4. **Embedded Images vs Linked Images:** Images can be directly embedded in the ORG file as base64 encoded strings, or they can be linked from external sources. I should look for linked images rather than embedded ones.\n\n5. **Non-image File Links:** There may be non-image file links present in the ORG file. The parser should discern between image file links and other file links.\n\n6. **Multiple Links on a Single Line:** There might be multiple image links on a single line, and each link should be extracted.\n\n7. **Invalid or Broken Links:** Some image links might be invalid or broken, and the parser should be prepared to handle or ignore these cases.\n\n8. **Textual Content:** The ORG file will contain a lot of textual content which is not relevant to the task of extracting image file names, so the parser needs to filter this out effectively.\n\nOnce I see the input ORG file, I will look for patterns that indicate an image file link and extract the filenames accordingly, while keeping in mind these potential difficulties and obstacles."
