We need to recognize all possible syntaxes used to include images.\n\n2. **Path Ambiguity**: Image files might be referenced with absolute or relative paths, and they might be located in different directories or even online with a URL. We must correctly parse these paths to identify the image files.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: We need to be aware of different image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) to accurately identify image files.\n\n4. **Embedded Links**: Images might not be directly included but could be embedded within links or other objects. It could require additional parsing logic to correctly extract the image filenames.\n\n5. **Comments or Non-image Links**: Some links or paths might be within commentary sections or could refer to non-image files. We need to distinguish these from actual image inclusions.\n\n6. **Markup Complexity**: An ORG file can contain complex markup that might interfere with simple text search methods. For example, an image filename might be part of a larger structure or macro that needs specific parsing logic.\n\nBy anticipating these challenges, I can apply a more robust parsing strategy that addresses these difficulties when analyzing the input file.
