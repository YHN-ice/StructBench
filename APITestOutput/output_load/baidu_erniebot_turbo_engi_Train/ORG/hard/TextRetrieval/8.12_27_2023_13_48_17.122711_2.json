The syntax for including images might vary, so I would need to be familiar with all the possible notations.\n\n2. **File Path Ambiguity**: Images could be referenced with absolute paths, relative paths, or even URLs. Distinguishing between local file paths and remote URLs, and extracting only the file names could be challenging.\n\n3. **Markup Overlap**: ORG files can contain markup for other elements like headlines, lists, tables, etc., which might closely resemble or even contain the markup for images. It's important to correctly parse the image markup without confusion with other elements.\n\n4. **Embedded Content**: Images might be embedded within other content, such as source code blocks or nested within other structural elements. This requires careful parsing to ensure that the context of the image inclusion is understood.\n\n5. **Comments or Inactive Markup**: Some images might be included in comments or in a way that they are not actively displayed (e.g., commented out). Deciding whether to consider these as part of the extracted image files would depend on the specific requirements.\n\n6. **Encoded or Encrypted Content**: In some cases, the paths of the images could be encoded or encrypted. While this is less common in ORG files, it could present an obstacle to straightforward extraction.\n\nTo proceed with the task, I would need to see the actual ORG file content to identify how images are included and address these potential difficulties accordingly."
