Identifying all the possible formats is necessary to ensure no images are missed.\n\n2. **Text Ambiguity**: The parser must distinguish between actual image file links and other text that might look similar to a file path but isn't one (e.g., code blocks, text within quotes).\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The image paths might be relative to the document or may be absolute paths. Handling both correctly is important to extract the file names accurately.\n\n4. **Embedded vs. External Images**: Images might be embedded directly within the ORG file in base64 encoding or linked as external files. The parser should be able to handle both cases.\n\n5. **File Name Validity**: Extracted file names must be valid and existing files. A link in the ORG file doesn't guarantee that the image file actually exists.\n\n6. **Markup Syntax Correctness**: The ORG file's syntax must be correctly followed for the parser to reliably find image files. If there are syntax errors near the image links, it can make it difficult to parse them properly.\n\n7. **Hidden or Commented Out Links**: Sometimes, links could be commented out or placed in sections that are not exported. Deciding whether to include such links can be a challenge.\n\n8. **Non-Image File Extensions**: Ensuring that only image file types are included (e.g., .jpg, .png) and excluding non-image files that may also be linked within the ORG file.\n\n9. **Versioning and Updates**: If the parser is based on a specific version of the ORG mode syntax, updates to ORG mode might introduce changes that could break the parser.\n\n10. **Performance**: If the ORG file is exceptionally large, performance considerations may come into play when designing the parser.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parser should have rules or patterns defined to specifically look for image file links, and it might need additional logic to confirm whether those links represent actual files by checking their existence or by validating their formats."
