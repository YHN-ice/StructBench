I need to correctly distinguish between image links and other links.\n\n6. **Embedded Data**: Rarely, images might be embedded directly in the file as data URIs instead of linked files. Recognizing and extracting these would be more complex.\n\n7. **Markup Misinterpretation**: There could be markup elements that resemble file paths or image references but are actually something else, such as code blocks or example blocks.\n\n8. **Textual References**: Filenames may be mentioned in the text without being actual links; distinguishing these instances is necessary.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, it's important that the rules for identifying image files within the ORG file are clear and that we account for different syntaxes and formats.
