Ensuring that all bold text is captured regardless of the markup used could be challenging.\n\n2. **Embedded Formatting:** Bold text might be embedded within other formatting elements, such as links, code snippets, or nested within other text styles like italic or underline. This could make it difficult to correctly identify and extract just the bold portions of the text.\n\n3. **Incomplete or Incorrect Formatting:** If the bold formatting is not applied correctly in the ORG file (e.g., missing closing asterisks or mismatched formatting symbols), it could be tricky to accurately identify what the user intended to be bold.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts:** Bold text that spans multiple lines may require careful parsing to ensure that all parts of the bold section are captured without including non-bold text.\n\n5. **Special Characters:** The presence of special characters or escape sequences within bold text could complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Contextual Understanding:** Without proper context, it might be difficult to determine if certain asterisks are meant for bold formatting or serve another purpose within the document (such as list items or sections).\n\n7. **File Size and Complexity:** A very large or complex ORG file could pose performance issues when parsing and extracting information.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust parsing strategy will need to be implemented that can handle various cases of bold formatting, embedded content, and special characters. Regular expressions and context-aware parsing may be necessary to achieve accurate results."
