Diverse Syntax for Images: ORG files can embed images using different syntaxes or markup patterns. Recognizing all the possible patterns for including images is necessary to ensure no image references are missed.\n\n2. Relative vs Absolute Paths: Image paths can be either relative to the location of the ORG file or absolute paths pointing to specific locations on the file system. It's important to identify which type of path is used and handle them adequately.\n\n3. File Extensions: Images can have various file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). Ensuring that the parser recognizes all relevant image file extensions is necessary for a complete extraction.\n\n4. Inline Images vs Linked Images: Images can be embedded directly within the ORG file or linked from external sources. The parser must be able to differentiate and extract filenames for both instances.\n\n5. Multiline Links: Sometimes, an image link may be broken up across multiple lines in the ORG file. Properly concatenating these lines to extract the full filename can be challenging.\n\n6. Hidden or Commented Image Links: Image references that are commented out or otherwise hidden within the ORG file's content should typically not be counted as included images.\n\n7. Encoding Issues: File names may have special characters or spaces that are encoded differently in the ORG file. Decoding these correctly is important to avoid missing or misnaming files.\n\nWithout seeing the input ORG file content, it's unclear which of these issues might be present, but these are common considerations when parsing files for specific content like image references."
