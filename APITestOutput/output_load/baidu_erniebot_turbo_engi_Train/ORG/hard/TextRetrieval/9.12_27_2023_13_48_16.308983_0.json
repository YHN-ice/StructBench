Different markup conventions: While the standard markup for bold text in Org-mode is wrapping text with asterisks like *bold text*, it's important to ensure that there are no variations or non-standard uses of the markup.\n\n2. Inline markup settings: If inline markup is disabled or customized in the Org file, it might affect how bold text is recognized.\n\n3. Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underlined, or code snippets. This could make it harder to parse just the bold text.\n\n4. Multi-line bold text: If the bold text spans multiple lines or includes line breaks, it might require a more sophisticated parsing approach to correctly extract the entire bold segment.\n\n5. Escaped characters: Asterisks used for purposes other than bold formatting, such as in lists or to escape special characters, could be mistaken for bold markup if not properly parsed.\n\n6. Links and footnotes: Bold text that includes links, footnotes, or other Org-mode elements will need special parsing rules to extract only the textual content without the markup.\n\n7. Non-text content: The file may contain non-text content such as tables, source code blocks, or other Org elements which could complicate the recognition of bold text.\n\nTo properly extract all bold texts, the parser must be able to differentiate between actual bold markup and other uses of asterisks or similar characters and handle all the intricacies of Org-mode formatting."
