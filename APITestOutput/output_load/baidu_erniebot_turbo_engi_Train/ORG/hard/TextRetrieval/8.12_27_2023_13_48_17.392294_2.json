It's necessary to parse these correctly without missing any references.\n\n4. **Non-image Files**: The parser must distinguish between image file references and non-image file references (like links to documents or other file types).\n\n5. **Formatting and Comments**: ORG files support comments and other formatting options that could obscure or comment out image references. These should be considered to avoid extracting non-relevant text.\n\n6. **Markup Characters**: Special markup characters that are part of ORG file formatting may surround image file names. The parser will have to strip these away to extract just the file names.\n\n7. **Broken Links**: Some image references might be broken or invalid. While this doesn't affect extraction per se, it might be worth noting which ones are actually valid files if verification is part of the task.\n\nOnce you provide the content of the ORG file, I can start parsing it and identify the lines that contain references to image files."
