However, users might introduce variations such as extra spaces (`* bold *`), or use different characters by mistake.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Text within ORG files can have multiple formatting options applied, such as being both bold and italic. This means the parser needs to correctly handle cases like `*/bold and italic/*` without incorrectly parsing the text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Asterisks used as literal characters rather than for formatting purposes could be escaped with a backslash (`\\*not bold\\*`). The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting markers and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Line Breaks and Multi-line Texts:** Bold text might span multiple lines, which requires the parser to maintain the state across line breaks when they are part of the formatted text.\n\n5. **Links or Special Syntax Inside Bold Text:** ORG files can contain links or other special syntax inside bold text, which might complicate the extraction (`*some text [[link][description]] more text*`).\n\n6. **Comments and Inactive Regions:** ORG files may contain commented-out sections or regions that should not be processed (denoted by `#` or `:`, respectively), so the parser must ignore any formatting within those regions.\n\n7. **File Size and Performance:** If the ORG file is particularly large, performance considerations may come into play, and efficient parsing algorithms will be required to handle the file in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parsing logic must be carefully designed to accurately identify and extract only the intended bold text segments while handling all the mentioned edge cases."
