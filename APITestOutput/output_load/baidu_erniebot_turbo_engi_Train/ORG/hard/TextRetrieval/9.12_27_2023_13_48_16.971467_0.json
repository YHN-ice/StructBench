The parser must be able to recognize all valid forms of bold syntax.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may be nested inside other formatting, such as lists, tables, or other styled text (italic, underline, etc.). The parser must differentiate between the levels of formatting and correctly extract only the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks or other markup characters may be escaped within the text, meaning they should not be interpreted as formatting. The parser needs to handle escaped characters properly.\n\n4. **Links and Footnotes**: Bold text might contain links or footnotes that have their syntax. The parser should be able to extract the bold text without including the syntax of links or footnotes.\n\n5. **Inline Code and Verbatim**: Text within inline code or verbatim blocks should not be treated as formatted text despite the presence of asterisks.\n\n6. **Document Structure**: If the ORG file contains document structure elements like headings or drawers, these may contain asterisks that are not indicative of bold text but rather denote structure.\n\n7. **Line Continuations**: In some cases, bold text may span multiple lines with line continuation characters. The parser must be able to concatenate these lines and recognize the complete bold text.\n\nThese are several potential obstacles that could complicate the process of extracting bold text from an ORG file accurately.
