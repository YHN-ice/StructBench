Identifying Image Syntax: Org-mode has a specific syntax to include images, so one must be familiar with how images are referenced within the file. Typically, they might be included as links.\n\n2. Variability in Link Formats: Images can be included in an ORG file in several ways (inline, as a link, etc.), and the parser needs to recognize all these formats.\n\n3. Relative vs. Absolute Paths: The image file paths could be relative or absolute, and the parser may need to handle these differently.\n\n4. File Path Complexity: File paths could have spaces, special characters, or be nested in directories, which can complicate the parsing process.\n\n5. Multiple Image Links on One Line: There could be multiple images referenced on a single line, so the parser must be able to extract multiple references from a single line of text.\n\n6. Images in Comments or Non-active Elements: Some images might be commented out or part of non-active elements within the ORG file. Deciding whether to include these could be challenging.\n\nNow, please provide the ORG file content so that I can attempt to extract the image file names for you."
