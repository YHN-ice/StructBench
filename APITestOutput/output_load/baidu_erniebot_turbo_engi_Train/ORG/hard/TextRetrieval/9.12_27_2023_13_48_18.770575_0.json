Typically, bold text is surrounded by asterisks like `*bold*`. The parser must correctly identify this pattern.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italic, underlined, or code blocks. The parser must ensure it doesn't capture false positives or misses bold text due to nesting.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: Asterisks might be used in the content for other purposes (like bullet points or to represent an action), and differentiating these uses from bold formatting is necessary.\n\n4. **Line Breaks**: Bold phrases might span multiple lines, and the parser must be able to handle and recognize when the bold formatting continues onto the subsequent line.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Users might escape asterisks to prevent them from being parsed as bold, and the parser needs to account for such escape characters.\n\n6. **Contextual Boldness**: Sometimes, the context determines whether asterisks should be interpreted as bold markers or not (e.g., in source code blocks, they should not).\n\n7. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Human error could result in inconsistent formatting, where a bold section is not properly closed off with another asterisk.\n\n8. **Performance and Efficiency**: If the ORG file is large, parsing it efficiently while maintaining accuracy might be challenging.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file or its contents so that I can assist you further in extracting all bold texts."
