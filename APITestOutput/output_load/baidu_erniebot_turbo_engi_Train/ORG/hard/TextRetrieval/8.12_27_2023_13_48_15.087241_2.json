Nonetheless, let's assume that you will provide the contents of the ORG file in a text format.

Recognizing all the possible formats (inline, linked, etc.) for image inclusion is essential.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: Images might be included with absolute or relative paths, and the paths could include various directory separators or URL encoding that might need interpretation.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: There are many possible image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser must recognize all the relevant ones.\n\n4. **Embedded vs. Linked Images**: Some images might be embedded directly within the ORG file using base64 or similar encoding, while others might be just linked. We need to differentiate and extract only the linked file names.\n\n5. **Textual Noise**: The ORG file could have non-image links or text that looks similar to image file links but isn't (false positives). The parser must correctly ignore these.\n\n6. **Formatting Variations**: The formatting of the ORG file might vary, with different ways to include images (like using markup for display options). The parser needs to handle these variations.\n\nIf you provide the text contents of the ORG file, I will do my best to manually identify and extract the image file names based on the text provided, keeping in mind these potential obstacles. Please paste the contents or describe the format, and I will assist you accordingly."
