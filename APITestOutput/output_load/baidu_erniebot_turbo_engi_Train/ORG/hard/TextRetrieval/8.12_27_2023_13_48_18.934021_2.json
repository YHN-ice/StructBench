For example, some images may be included using links (`[[file:image.jpg]]`), while others might be included as plain text (e.g., `file:image.jpg`). We will need to identify all variations used for embedding images.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be referenced with either relative or absolute paths. While extracting image file names, it's important to note the type of path used and handle each appropriately.\n\n3. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There could be lines with multiple images included, which means the parser needs to identify and extract each image file name separately.\n\n4. **Non-Image File Links**: The ORG file might contain links to non-image files or URLs, which should not be confused with image file names.\n\n5. **Embedded Image Data**: In some cases, image data might be embedded directly into the file (such as Base64 encoded images). This is less common in ORG files but would present a challenge in terms of extraction and distinction from actual file names.\n\n6. **Comments and Inactive Links**: The ORG file might contain comments or inactive links that should be ignored by the parser when extracting active image references.\n\n7. **Special Characters in File Names**: Image file names might contain spaces or special characters that are part of the file name but can be mistakenly treated as delimiters or formatting markers.\n\n8. **File Extension Handling**: The parser should recognize various image file extensions such as .jpg, .png, .gif, etc., and not just one specific type.\n\n9. **Formatting and Markup Inside the ORG File**: ORG files support text formatting and additional markup, which could interfere with the straightforward extraction of image file names if not handled correctly.\n\nNow, please provide the input ORG file for me to parse and extract all included image files."
