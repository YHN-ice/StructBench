Identifying all the possible syntaxes used for embedding images is necessary.\n\n2. **File Path Formats**: Image file paths could be absolute or relative, and they could be in different formats depending on the operating system.\n\n3. **Link Format**: Images can be linked directly or as a part of a descriptive link. Parsing both types requires different approaches.\n\n4. **Embedded Base64 Images**: In some cases, images might be embedded directly into the ORG file as Base64 encoded strings, which would require special handling.\n\n5. **Textual References to Images**: There might be textual references to images that are not actual file inclusions but rather descriptions or comments. These should not be mistaken for actual image files.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Identifying what constitutes an image file may require checking for common image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif).\n\n7. **External Links**: Some images might be hosted externally and included via URLs. Deciding whether to count these as \"included image files\" might depend on the specific requirements of the task.\n\n8. **Multiline Links**: In some cases, links may be broken across multiple lines, which complicates the parsing process.\n\n9. **Encoding Issues**: If the ORG file has encoding issues, it could affect the ability to properly parse and extract image filenames.\n\nOnce the ORG file content is provided, these are the challenges I will need to navigate in order to extract all included image files correctly."
