Parsing these correctly without losing the bold formatting could be challenging.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it could complicate the extraction as a simple line-by-line parsing might miss multiline formatted text.\n\n6. **File Encoding and Characters**: The file encoding and any special characters within the text might affect the parsing process, leading to incorrect extractions.\n\n7. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like sections or block quotes, and extracting these requires careful parsing to maintain context.\n\nWhen these challenges are taken into account, the parser would need to be designed with robust pattern recognition to accurately identify and extract bold text while handling different formatting scenarios within the ORG file."
