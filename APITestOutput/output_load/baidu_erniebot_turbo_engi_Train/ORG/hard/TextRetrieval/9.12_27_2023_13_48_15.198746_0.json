Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered when trying to extract bold texts from an ORG file:\n\n1. **Format Variations**: ORG files allow for multiple ways to denote bold text, such as surrounding the text with asterisks (*text*) or using specific markup conventions. The parser needs to be aware of all these variations.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting options such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. The parser must properly handle and isolate the bold text even within such nested structures.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: The bold text could contain special characters or escape sequences that need to be handled correctly to not disrupt the parsing process.\n\n4. **Links and Footnotes**: In ORG files, links and footnotes might contain bold text, and the parser should be capable of extracting the bold text without including link or footnote syntax inappropriately.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser must be able to recognize and extract bold text segments that are not confined to a single line.\n\n6. **False Positives**: Asterisks can also be used for lists or for other purposes in ORG files; the parser must distinguish between these uses and the actual bold formatting.\n\n7. **Contextual Understanding**: Some ORG files might use context-sensitive rules for formatting. The parser should ideally understand the context to avoid incorrect extractions.\n\nOnce we have the input ORG file, we would need to address these potential issues while extracting the bold text."
