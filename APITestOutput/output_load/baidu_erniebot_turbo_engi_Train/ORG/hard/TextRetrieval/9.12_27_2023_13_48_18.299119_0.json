Identifying the correct syntax for bold text: In ORG files, bold text is typically surrounded by asterisks. However, asterisks can also be used for other formatting or within content, so it's important to distinguish when they are used to denote bold text specifically.\n\n2. Dealing with variations and edge cases: There might be variations in how bold text is presented, such as additional whitespace or the use of additional asterisks. Handling these variations correctly is crucial for accurate extraction.\n\n3. Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements (like italic or underlined text), which can complicate the parsing process.\n\n4. Multiline bold text: Bold text could span across multiple lines, and the parser must be able to recognize and extract it even when it's not contained within a single line.\n\n5. Escaped characters: Asterisks used as literal characters might be escaped, meaning they don't indicate bold formatting. The parser needs to ignore escaped asterisks.\n\n6. Comments or code blocks: Bold markers within comments or code blocks should typically not be treated as bold text for the purposes of content formatting.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be designed with a robust set of rules to accurately interpret the markup and extract only the relevant bold text segments."
