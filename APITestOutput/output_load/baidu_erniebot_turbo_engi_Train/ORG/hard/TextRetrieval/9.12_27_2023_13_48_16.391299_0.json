Bold text is typically denoted by asterisks (e.g., `*bold*`), but there could be variations or additional markers that could affect parsing.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold text could be part of a larger block of text with various formatting options applied. This means that the bold text might not be on its own line or might be combined with other formatting like italics, underlines, etc.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Sometimes bold text might contain other formatted text, such as code blocks, links, or other emphasized text, which can complicate extraction.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for creating lists or headlines in ORG mode. The parser would need to differentiate between bold text and these other uses.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Org mode allows for escape characters to prevent formatting. If asterisks are escaped, they should not be interpreted as bold markers.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must be able to detect and handle multiline strings that are meant to be bold.\n\n7. **Document Structure**: Headlines, blocks, and other structural elements can contain bold text, and the parser must be able to navigate these structures to extract the bold correctly.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the parser would need to accurately recognize and extract the bold text while accounting for the context in which the bold formatting appears."
