Images could be linked inline, embedded as attachments, or even generated from source code blocks.\n\n2. **Link Formats**: The syntax for linking to images can vary. It might include plain links, descriptive links with square brackets, or links with additional attributes.\n\n3. **Path Specifications**: Image paths could be absolute, relative, or even include variables or special characters that need to be interpreted correctly.\n\n4. **Multiline Links**: Sometimes links to images might be split across multiple lines, which would require the parsing logic to handle line continuations.\n\n5. **Comments or Inactive Links**: Some links might be commented out or made inactive by the user, which should not be considered as included image files.\n\n6. **Link Clutter**: The document might contain non-image file links interspersed with the image file links, and the parser needs to distinguish between them.\n\n7. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images might be embedded directly in base64 encoding, which would require separate handling compared to linked image files.\n\n8. **Markup Confusion**: ORG files can contain a lot of different markup for different purposes (e.g., headings, lists, tables), and it's possible that some of this markup could be confused for image links if not handled properly.\n\nDealing with these potential issues involves having a robust parsing strategy that accounts for the flexible nature of ORG mode's syntax and structure."
