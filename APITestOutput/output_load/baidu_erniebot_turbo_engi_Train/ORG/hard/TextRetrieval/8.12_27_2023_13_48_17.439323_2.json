We'll need to identify the correct syntax used for image links and filter them out correctly.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The image file paths could be relative or absolute. If they're relative, we might need additional context to resolve the actual file location.\n\n3. **Embedded Images**: Images could potentially be embedded as base64 data within the file rather than linked as separate files. Such embedded images won't have traditional file names to extract.\n\n4. **Variety of Image Formats**: Images can come in many formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). We need to ensure we've accounted for all possible image file extensions that could appear in the ORG file.\n\n5. **Comments and Non-image File Links**: There could be non-image file links or commented-out sections that include image file names. We'll need to discern actual image file links from other content.\n\n6. **Duplicate Image Names**: There may be duplicate image names; handling whether to list duplicates or filter them out might be necessary based on the requirements.\n\n7. **Multiline Links**: Sometimes links could be split across multiple lines in ORG files, making pattern matching more challenging.\n\n8. **Syntax Variations**: ORG mode allows for a lot of customization, including custom link types which could alter the default syntax for image links.\n\nIdentifying and overcoming these obstacles will be essential for accurately extracting all included image files from an ORG file."
