Dealing with different types of paths (absolute vs. relative) or URLs (http vs. https) can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **File Formats:** The images could be in different formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) which would need to be accounted for in the extraction process.\n\n4. **Textual Noise:** There could be non-image links or other pieces of text that resemble image links but are not, which would need to be filtered out.\n\n5. **Multiline Links:** Sometimes, image links may be broken across multiple lines, which requires handling multiline patterns.\n\n6. **Markup Within Links:** There can be additional markup within the image links such as captions, attributes, or formatting, which needs to be parsed out to isolate the file names.\n\n7. **Hidden or Commented Images:** Some images might be included in commented sections or in a way that they are not meant to be parsed, so the parser must distinguish between visible and hidden/commented content.\n\nIn order to provide an accurate list of included image files, the parser will have to address these challenges effectively."
