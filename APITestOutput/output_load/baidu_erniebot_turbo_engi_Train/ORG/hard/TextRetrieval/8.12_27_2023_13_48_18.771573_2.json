Ensuring that the parser recognizes all possible formats is crucial.\n\n2. **Relative vs. absolute paths**: Images can be included using either relative or absolute paths. The parser must handle both correctly.\n\n3. **Link descriptions**: Sometimes links to images include a description part which may not be part of the actual file path.\n\n4. **File extensions**: There are various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and the parser must recognize all relevant extensions.\n\n5. **Embedded vs. linked images**: Images might be directly embedded in base64 or linked from an external source. The parser should differentiate between these.\n\n6. **Comments and inactive links**: The ORG file might contain commented-out links or inactive links that should not be counted as included images.\n\n7. **Multi-line links**: Sometimes the link to an image might be broken across multiple lines for readability, which the parser will need to handle.\n\n8. **Special characters in filenames**: Filenames may contain spaces, special characters, or unicode characters that need to be dealt with correctly.\n\n9. **In-text occurrences**: The syntax for an image might appear in a text block without it being an actual inclusion, like in examples or code blocks.\n\n10. **Contextual awareness**: The parser needs to understand the context to determine if a link is indeed an image inclusion or part of a different construct (like a footnote or a different kind of object).\n\nIf you can provide the input ORG file content, I'll be happy to proceed with extracting the image file names."
