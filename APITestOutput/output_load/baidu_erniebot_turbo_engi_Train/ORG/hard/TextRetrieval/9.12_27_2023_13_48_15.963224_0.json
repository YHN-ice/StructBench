The parser should be able to recognize all methods used to denote bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text can be inside other formatting markers, such as links, code blocks, or italicized text. The parser must handle nested formatting correctly and still extract the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or other formatting characters are escaped to show them as literals rather than formatting. The parser should differentiate between formatting markers and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser should be able to handle this and still extract the full text that is intended to be bold.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting**: In some cases, users may not follow the exact syntax for bolding (like missing a closing asterisk). The parser might need to be able to handle these cases gracefully.\n\n6. **Embedded Code or Special Blocks**: Bold markers within code blocks or other special blocks should not be treated as bold text as they do not have formatting within those blocks.\n\n7. **Performance Issues**: Depending on the size of the ORG file and the complexity of its content, performance could be an issue, and so the parser should be efficient.\n\nOnce the ORG file is provided, we will be able to see which of these potential issues are actually present and need to be addressed in order to extract the bold text correctly."
