ORG files are plain text files used for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system. They are typically used with Emacs' Org-mode, although there are other compatible software options available.\n\nPotential difficulties and obstacles that might occur during the process include:\n\n1. **Syntax Variations**: Bold text in ORG files is commonly denoted by surrounding the text with asterisks, like this: `*bold text*`. However, variations in syntax or additional markers might complicate extraction if they're not accounted for.\n\n2. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as defining headers or list items. It's essential to distinguish between these uses and actual bold text.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: If bold text contains other formatting within it, such as links or code, the parser will need to handle these nested elements appropriately to extract only the bold text.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text could span multiple lines. The parser must be able to recognize when the bold formatting starts and ends, even if there's a line break.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Users might escape asterisks with a backslash (\\) to use them literally in the text, which means not every asterisk denotes bold text.\n\n6. **Differentiating from Italics and Underline**: Org-mode uses slashes (/) for italics and underscores (_) for underline. These should not be confused with asterisks used for bold.\n\n7. **Encoding**: The file encoding must be correctly handled to ensure special characters inside bold text are read accurately.\n\n8. **File Inconsistencies**: Hand-edited ORG files may contain inconsistencies or errors in formatting that could confuse a parser.\n\nTo give an accurate answer, the parser must be designed to handle these potential issues. Now, I can proceed to parse the ORG file contents once you provide it."
