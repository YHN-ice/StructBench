However, there might be variations or additional spaces, like `* bold *`, which could affect parsing.\n\n2. **Embedded Formatting**: Bold text may have other formatting embedded within it, such as links, code, or italics. These additional formats may complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes characters like asterisks are escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`) to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting. We need to ensure that we don't accidentally extract these as bold.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, we need to account for line breaks in our parsing logic.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Asterisks might be used in the document for other purposes, such as bullet lists or as emphasis without intending to make the text bold. We need to distinguish these cases from actual bold text.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users may not always strictly adhere to the formatting rules, leading to inconsistencies that make parsing more difficult.\n\nOnce we've seen the input file, we will be able to determine which of these challenges are present and how to address them in order to extract the bold text correctly."
