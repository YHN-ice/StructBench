The parser must handle all such variations.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might have nested formatting, such as italic or underline within it. The parser needs to extract only the bold text and not be confused by other formatting.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: The parser needs to handle escape characters that are intended to prevent the markdown from being processed as formatting.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle this without breaking the extraction.\n\n6. **Contextual Meaning**: Sometimes, the asterisk might be used in a context that does not indicate bold formatting (e.g., in a list or as a multiplication symbol). The parser should differentiate between formatting and other uses.\n\n7. **Incomplete Markup**: The ORG file may contain incomplete or incorrect markup which could lead to incorrect or incomplete extraction of the bold text.\n\nThe parser must robustly handle all these potential difficulties to accurately extract and print each instance of bold text.
