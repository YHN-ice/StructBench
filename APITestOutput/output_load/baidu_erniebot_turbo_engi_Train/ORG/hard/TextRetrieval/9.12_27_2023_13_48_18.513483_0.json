Accounting for all syntax variations is crucial to ensure no bold text is missed.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italic, underline, or code blocks. Proper parsing should be able to distinguish the bold text even within nested formats.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, formatting characters can be escaped to display them literally rather than to apply formatting. It's important to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Links and References**: Bold text might be part of links or references, which could have additional syntax that must be correctly parsed to extract only the text content.\n\n5. **Partial Formatting**: There might be cases where only part of a word or phrase is bolded, so the parser needs to handle partial formatting without losing the context.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold texts could span multiple lines especially when using block syntax for bold text, and this needs to be handled correctly.\n\n7. **Comments and Metadata**: ORG files may contain comments and metadata that are not part of the content. These should not be confused with bold text.\n\n8. **File Structure**: ORG files often have a hierarchical structure with headings, lists, etc. It's important to parse the file in a way that respects this structure while extracting the bold texts.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties, I'm ready to parse the ORG file and extract all bold texts. Please provide the input file or its content to proceed with the task."
