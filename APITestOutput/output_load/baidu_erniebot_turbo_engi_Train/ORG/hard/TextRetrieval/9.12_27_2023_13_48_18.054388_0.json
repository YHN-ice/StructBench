In typical ORG files, text is made bold using asterisks, like this: *bold text*. Some potential difficulties and obstacles that might occur during the process include:\n\n1. Distinguishing between bold text and other uses of asterisks: Asterisks are used for various formatting purposes in ORG mode, such as headlines (which can start with one or more asterisks), list items, and italic text (when used with slashes). Care must be taken to ensure only bold text is extracted.\n\n2. Handling nested formatting: Text could have nested formatting, such as bold and italic (*bold /italic/ text*). The parser must correctly extract the bold text while ignoring or properly handling the nested formatting.\n\n3. Multi-line bold text: Bold text might span multiple lines, so the parser should be able to handle line breaks within bold sections.\n\n4. Inconsistent formatting: Users might make mistakes or use non-standard formatting, which can lead to inconsistencies. The parser should be robust enough to handle these cases where possible.\n\n5. Escaped asterisks: Asterisks that are meant to be a part of the text rather than formatting (escaped with a backslash, like \\*) should not be mistaken for bold markup.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I will be able to provide a more targeted approach to extract the bold texts."
