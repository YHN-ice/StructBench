I will need to correctly identify all forms of bold syntax to ensure no bold text is missed.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. Handling nested formatting correctly without missing or misinterpreting the bold text is crucial.\n\n3. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines. Ensuring that the extraction process captures the entire bold text, even when it's not contained within a single line, is necessary.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Special characters within the bold text could interfere with the parsing process. I would need to handle special characters correctly so that they do not break the parsing logic.\n\n5. **Ambiguities**: There might be ambiguities in the interpretation of the text that looks like formatting but isn't used as such. For example, asterisks could be used for bullet points or other purposes rather than for formatting.\n\n6. **Incomplete or Broken Formatting**: The file might have incomplete or broken formatting where the bold markers are not properly paired or used incorrectly.\n\n7. **Large Files and Performance**: If the ORG file is large, performance might be an issue when parsing the file. The extraction process should be efficient enough to handle large files.\n\nOnce I have the input file, I will be able to apply a parsing strategy that takes these potential issues into account to successfully extract all bold texts."
