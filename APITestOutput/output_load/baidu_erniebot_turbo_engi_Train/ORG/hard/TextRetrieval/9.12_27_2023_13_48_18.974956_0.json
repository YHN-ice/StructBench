Commonly, asterisks are used, but the exact syntax might vary.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting options like italic, underline, or struck-through text. This can make it more complex to extract just the bold text.\n\n3. **Special Characters:** The presence of special characters or escape sequences within the bold text might affect the parsing process.\n\n4. **Inline Formatting vs Block Formatting:** Bold might be applied inline (within a paragraph) or as a block (separate from other text). Handling these cases might require different approaches.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Syntax:** Sometimes the syntax can be ambiguous, like a single asterisk can denote a list item or bold text depending on the context.\n\n6. **Incorrect Syntax:** If the file has syntax errors (like missing closing asterisks), it can lead to incorrect extraction or missing bold text.\n\n7. **Large Files and Efficiency:** For very large ORG files, efficiency of the parsing algorithm could be a concern.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser needs to be robust and carefully designed to handle different scenarios correctly. Now let's see the input file to proceed with the task."
