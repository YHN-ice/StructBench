Extracting filenames from links is straightforward, but embedded images might not have explicit filenames.\n3. **Syntax Variations**: ORG files can include images with different link syntaxes or markup. For example, `[[file:img.png]]`, `#+CAPTION: This is an image\\n[[./images/img.jpg]]`, or using HTML tags like `<img src=\"image.png\">`.\n4. **Textual References**: There might be references to image filenames within the text that are not actual inclusions of the image file itself.\n5. **Path Handling**: The images might be included with relative or absolute paths.
