Special characters might be part of the formatting or actual content.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: In ORG files, asterisks used for other purposes than formatting (like in lists or as multiplication symbols) may be escaped, and distinguishing these from formatting markers is important.\n\n6. **Contextual Interpretation**: The meaning of asterisks can change based on context; for example, asterisks at the beginning of a line typically indicate a header rather than bold text.\n\n7. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be instances where the bold formatting is started but not properly terminated, leading to ambiguity in what should be considered as bold text.\n\n8. **ORG Mode Features**: ORG mode has many features, and different configurations or plugins might change how bold text is represented or exported, which may affect parsing.\n\nAddressing these difficulties would require a robust parsing strategy that can handle a variety of cases and accurately identify bold text within an ORG file."
