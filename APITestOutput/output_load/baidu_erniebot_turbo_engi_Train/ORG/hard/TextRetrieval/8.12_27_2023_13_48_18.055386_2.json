The parser must handle both.\n\n3. **Different file extensions**: There are multiple image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser needs to recognize all possible image extensions.\n\n4. **Text that looks like image links but isn't**: There might be text within the ORG file that resembles an image link but is not intended to be one (e.g., example text or a commented-out link).\n\n5. **Embedded images**: Images might be embedded inside other elements (like tables or lists), which could complicate the parsing logic.\n\n6. **File path correctness**: Extracted file paths need to be checked for correctness; a mistyped or broken file path could lead to confusion.\n\n7. **Image references across different lines**: An image reference might be broken up across lines if the ORG file has been line-wrapped, so multiline parsing may be needed.\n\n8. **Commented out links or inactive links**: Some image links might be commented out or set as inactive, which means they should not necessarily be included in the list of images.\n\nOnce we see the actual input ORG file, we can apply appropriate strategies to overcome these obstacles and extract the image files accurately."
