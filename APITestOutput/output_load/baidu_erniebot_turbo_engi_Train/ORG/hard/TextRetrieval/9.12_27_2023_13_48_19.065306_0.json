For example, if there is a single asterisk at the beginning of a line, it might be a section heading rather than bold text.\n\n6. **Ambiguous asterisks:** Asterisks could be used in different contexts, such as for bullet points or for other markup purposes, which means they don't always denote bold text.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the parser's logic needs to be robust enough to handle different scenarios and edge cases to ensure only the correct instances of bold text are extracted."
