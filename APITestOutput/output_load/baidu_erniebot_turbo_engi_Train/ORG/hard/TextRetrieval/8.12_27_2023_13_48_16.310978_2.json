Each type requires a different method to extract.\n\n3. **File Format Variations**: There could be various image formats (e.g., jpg, png, gif) included in the ORG file.\n\n4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Some images might be included with relative paths while others with absolute paths. This could affect how the file names are extracted and displayed.\n\n5. **Embedded vs Linked Images**: Images can either be embedded directly within the ORG file or linked from external sources. We need to distinguish between these cases.\n\n6. **Markup Complexity**: An ORG file can have complex markup that might obscure image links such as nested structures or commented lines.\n\n7. **Non-image File Extensions**: Ensuring that the extracted files are indeed image files and not other file types with similar naming patterns.\n\n8. **Image File Naming**: There might be special characters or spaces in the image file names, which could complicate extraction.\n\n9. **Encoding Issues**: Character encoding within the ORG file could affect the ability to properly parse and display the image filenames.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we can address these potential obstacles accordingly and attempt to extract the image file names."
