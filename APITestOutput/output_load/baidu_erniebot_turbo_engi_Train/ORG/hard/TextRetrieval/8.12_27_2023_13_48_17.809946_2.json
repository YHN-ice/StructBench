Recognizing all these different forms requires understanding the syntax used for images.\n\n2. **Variety of image formats**: Images could be in various formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF), and the parser needs to identify all of these as image files.\n\n3. **File path variations**: Image links might include absolute paths, relative paths, or even URLs. The parser must handle each case correctly to extract the filename.\n\n4. **Embedded vs linked images**: Some images might be embedded directly into the ORG document, while others might just be linked. The parser should discern this and extract filenames accordingly.\n\n5. **Markup complexity**: ORG files can have complex structures with nested headings, lists, and different types of markup which might make it challenging to correctly identify where an image file is referenced.\n\n6. **Text that looks like image files**: There might be text within the document that looks like an image file link but isn't (e.g., examples, code blocks). The parser must avoid false positives.\n\n7. **Capturing duplicates**: If the same image is referenced multiple times, the parser should decide whether to list each occurrence or deduplicate the filenames.\n\nTo handle these potential issues, the parser needs to have a robust understanding of the ORG file syntax and a clear set of rules for identifying image file links. Once we have the input file, we can apply these considerations to accurately extract the image file names."
