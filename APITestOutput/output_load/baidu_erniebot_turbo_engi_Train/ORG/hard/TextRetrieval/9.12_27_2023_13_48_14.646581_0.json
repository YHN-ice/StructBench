Commonly, asterisks (*) are used, but the formatting can vary. For example, text could be surrounded by single asterisks (*text*), double asterisks (**text**), or other variations. Identifying all the correct patterns is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting markers such as italic, underline, or code blocks. The parser must be able to correctly identify bold text within these contexts without being confused by the surrounding markers.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks used for formatting might be escaped (e.g., \\*text\\*), which means they do not denote bold text. The parser should be programmed to recognize and handle escaped characters properly.\n\n4. **In-line Formatting**: There might be bold text inline with other text (e.g., this is **bold** text), rather than on a separate line. The parser needs to correctly extract the bold portion without including the surrounding text.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Asterisks might be used in the context of lists or other elements that do not indicate bold text. The parser must distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n6. **File Structure and Metadata**: An ORG file can contain structural and metadata elements, such as headings, lists, links, etc., which might complicate the extraction of plain text elements like bold text.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: The parser must be robust enough to handle malformed formatting or unexpected input gracefully, without crashing or producing incorrect output.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges helps to create a more effective ORG file parser that can accurately extract bold texts from the file content."
