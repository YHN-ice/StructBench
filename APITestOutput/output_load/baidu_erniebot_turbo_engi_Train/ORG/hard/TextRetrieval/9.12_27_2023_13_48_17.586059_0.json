Distinguishing between these uses is crucial.\n\n2. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text might span across multiple lines. A naive approach that only looks for bold markers within the same line might miss these instances.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might contain other formatting, like /italic/ or _underline_. We must ensure that only the bold formatting is accounted for and other formatting is ignored in the extraction process.\n\n4. **Escaped asterisks**: Asterisks used as part of the content rather than formatting must be correctly ignored. This means recognizing escape characters or syntax that denotes literal asterisks.\n\n5. **Incomplete markers**: There could be instances where the bold markers are not properly closed, leading to ambiguity about which text is meant to be bold.\n\n6. **Other uses of asterisks**: Asterisks may be used in lists or for other organizational purposes within the document, which should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\nOnce the input ORG file is provided, I can apply the necessary parsing logic to extract the bold text, keeping in mind these potential difficulties."
