The parser must correctly identify and extract the file names regardless of the path type.\n\n3. **Markup Noise**: Org files can contain a lot of additional markup for formatting, which might make it challenging to identify image file names if they are not clearly delineated.\n\n4. **Non-Standard File Extensions**: While common image file extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif` are easily recognizable, there could be less common or custom file extensions that still represent image files.\n\n5. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: If multiple images are included on a single line, the parser must be able to distinguish and extract each image file name separately.\n\n6. **Linked Thumbnails**: Sometimes thumbnails are linked to larger images; both the thumbnail and the full-size image file names should be extracted if present.\n\n7. **Comments or Inactive Links**: The org file may contain commented-out lines or inactive links that include image file names. Depending on the requirements, you may need to decide whether to include or exclude these.\n\n8. **Encoded URLs or Special Characters**: Image references might contain URL-encoded characters or special characters that need to be decoded or handled appropriately.\n\nOnce we have the input org file, we will need to apply pattern matching or a similar strategy to accurately extract all image file names while navigating these potential challenges."
