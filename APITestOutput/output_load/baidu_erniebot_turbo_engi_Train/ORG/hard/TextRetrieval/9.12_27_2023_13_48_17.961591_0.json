We need to handle all these markups correctly.\n\n2. **Nested formatting:** Bold text might be nested with other formatting, like italic or underline. This could complicate the parsing because we need to differentiate the bold markup from other formats.\n\n3. **Escaped characters:** Sometimes asterisks or other characters used for bold formatting might be escaped, meaning they are not intended to format text but to be displayed as literal characters. The parser needs to recognize and handle such cases.\n\n4. **Multiline bold text:** Bold text in ORG files can span multiple lines, especially when using block syntax. The parser should correctly handle multiline formatting.\n\n5. **Links and attachments:** ORG files might contain links or attachments within bold text, which could be formatted differently. The parser will need to identify and possibly ignore or include these in the output.\n\n6. **Distinguishing headings from bold text:** In ORG files, headings are also marked with asterisks but serve a different purpose than bold formatting. The parser must distinguish between headings and bold text.\n\n7. **Corrupted or non-standard syntax:** If the ORG file does not strictly follow the syntax rules (perhaps due to human error), the parser has to either correct the mistakes or handle them gracefully.\n\n8. **Comments and directives:** ORG mode supports comments and directives that might contain sequences resembling bold formatting. The parser should ignore these unless they are part of the actual content.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser will need to have robust pattern matching capabilities and a clear understanding of the ORG format syntax rules, including context for where bold formatting is expected or allowed."
