The parser must recognize all these formats.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: The image links could be either relative or absolute paths. The parser needs to account for this when extracting the file names.\n\n3. **Embedded Images in Other Constructs**: Images might be embedded not only as standalone links but also within other constructs, such as tables or lists. The parser must be able to extract image links from these contexts as well.\n\n4. **Image References in Descriptions**: An image file might be referenced in the description rather than directly linked, which could make it harder to identify as an actual file link.\n\n5. **Non-Image Links**: The parser must distinguish between image file links and other types of links to ensure it only extracts image file names.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: It must recognize various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and not confuse them with non-image file extensions.\n\n7. **Commented or Inactive Links**: There may be commented out or inactive links that should not be counted as included image files.\n\nAfter understanding these potential difficulties, I would need to see the content of the ORG file to apply the appropriate logic and extract the image file names."
