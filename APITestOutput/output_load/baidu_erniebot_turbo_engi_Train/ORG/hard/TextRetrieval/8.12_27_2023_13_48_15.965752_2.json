The parser needs to recognize all possible ways images can be embedded or linked.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be referenced using relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs. The parser must handle all these variations.\n\n4. **Inline vs. Block Images**: ORG files can include images inline with text or as separate blocks. The parser must correctly identify image filenames in both cases.\n\n5. **Linked vs. Embedded Images**: Some images may be linked to external sources rather than embedded directly. The parser needs to differentiate between actual image files and mere links to images.\n\n6. **Non-Standard Markup**: If the ORG file uses non-standard markup for images or has corrupted syntax, it could make parsing difficult.\n\n7. **Multiple References**: The same image might be referenced multiple times in the document. The parser must decide whether to list duplicates or filter them out.\n\n8. **Commented Out Image References**: The ORG file might contain commented-out sections which include image references that are not meant to be parsed.\n\n9. **Special Characters**: Filenames with special characters or spaces might need special handling to be correctly extracted.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues can help in developing a more robust parsing strategy. Once the input file is provided, I can apply the appropriate parsing logic to extract the image filenames."
