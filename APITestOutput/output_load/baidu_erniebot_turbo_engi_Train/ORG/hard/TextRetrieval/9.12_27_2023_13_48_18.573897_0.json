We need to be aware of all possible markup variations to accurately extract bold texts.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text may be nested within other formatting like italics, underlines, or code blocks. This requires careful parsing to ensure that only the bold text is extracted without the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. **In-line and Multi-line Bold Texts:** Bold text could be placed inline with other text or span across multiple lines. The parser should handle both situations.\n\n4. **Special Characters:** If the bold text contains special characters or markup characters, it might interfere with the correct parsing of the content.\n\n5. **Links and Footnotes:** In ORG mode, links or footnotes might be included within bold text. It's important to decide how to handle these elements—whether to include or exclude them in the extracted text.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters:** Escaped characters within bold text might need to be unescaped during processing.\n\n7. **File Size and Complexity:** Large files with complex structures might pose a challenge in terms of processing time and resource consumption.\n\nIt's essential to design the parser with these potential difficulties in mind to ensure accurate and reliable extraction of bold texts from the ORG file.
