Here are potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise:\n\n1. **Syntax Variability**: ORG files can include links in different ways (inline, linked from a description, etc.), and images could be referenced with various syntaxes or markup. Identifying all the possible ways an image can be included requires comprehensive knowledge of the ORG markup.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images in the ORG file might be referenced using absolute paths, relative paths, or even URLs. Determining the actual file names might require resolving these paths relative to the ORG file's location.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Not all images may have standard `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., extensions. Some might use less common image formats or even lack an extension, complicating their identification.\n\n4. **Embedded Images**: Images might be embedded directly in the ORG file in base64 encoding or another binary-to-text encoding format, which would need to be identified and possibly extracted differently than standard image links.\n\n5. **Markup Variations**: There could be variations in how images are displayed within the ORG file, such as different attributes for width, height, captions, etc., which can complicate the regex or parsing logic.\n\n6. **Link Text**: An image link might also have descriptive text that could confuse simple text search methods. We need to ensure we're extracting the actual link, not the accompanying text.\n\n7. **File Accessibility**: If paths are provided, there's an assumption that the image files are accessible from the parser's environment, which may not always be the case, especially for URL references.\n\nOnce we have the input ORG file, we can construct a tailored approach to extract all included image files by addressing these potential obstacles."
