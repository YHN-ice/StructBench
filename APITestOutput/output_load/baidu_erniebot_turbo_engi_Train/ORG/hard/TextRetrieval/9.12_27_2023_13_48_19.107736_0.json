The parser needs to correctly distinguish between these uses and bold formatting.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes asterisks are escaped to show the literal symbol rather than formatting, which should not be counted as bold text.\n\n5. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested inside other bold text or different formatting types, which could complicate extraction.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it may be more challenging to identify and extract it properly.\n\n7. **File Structure and Metadata**: ORG files can contain metadata, footnotes, and other structural elements that should not be confused with content formatting.\n\nAddressing these issues requires a robust parsing strategy that can correctly interpret the ORG file's syntax and structure."
