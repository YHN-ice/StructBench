It's necessary to distinguish between these uses and actual bold text.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape asterisks to prevent them from being parsed as bold, resulting in them being present in the text without indicating bold formatting.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting**: There could be instances where the bold formatting is not properly closed with a matching pair of asterisks, leading to incorrect parsing of the bold text.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, complicating its detection if the parser expects it to be on a single line.\n\n7. **File Structure**: Larger ORG files with complex structures may contain many elements such as tables, blocks, and more, which could interfere with simple pattern matching.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the ORG file has encoding issues or contains non-standard characters, it could affect the accuracy of the text extraction.\n\nWithout seeing the specific input file, these are general issues that could potentially arise when trying to extract bold text from an ORG file.
