We must handle these syntax variations carefully.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: If asterisks are used in the text not to denote bold but as literal characters, they may be escaped with a backslash (`\\*`). These should not be confused with bold markers.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: ORG files can have nested formatting, where bold text might also be italicized, underlined, or struck through. Parsing nested formatting correctly to isolate the bold text can be challenging.\n\n4. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text in ORG may span multiple lines, so the parser would need to be able to handle multiline formatted text.\n\n5. **Asterisks in Code Blocks**: Text within code blocks or examples shouldn't be parsed for formatting, as asterisks within code are likely not meant to denote bold text.\n\n6. **Special Cases**: There might be special cases or additional formatting considerations within the ORG file that are unique to this particular file format variant.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file and can analyze its contents, I will look for any occurrence of `*` surrounding text, keeping in mind the above potential difficulties.
