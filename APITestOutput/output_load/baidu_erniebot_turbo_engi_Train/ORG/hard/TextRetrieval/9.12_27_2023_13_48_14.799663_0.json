We'll need to understand and handle the variations consistently.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting (like italic, underline, code, or strikethrough). We'll need to ensure that we don't capture the surrounding formatting or miss the nested bold text.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: The bold text itself might contain special characters or markup that could interfere with parsing, such as asterisks within the bolded section.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, and we'll need to ensure that we capture the entire section while handling line breaks appropriately.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Users might have escaped characters (like a backslash before an asterisk) that should not be interpreted as markup. We have to discern and respect escaped characters.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: User errors or idiosyncratic use of formatting might lead to inconsistencies that make it hard to identify bold text properly.\n\n7. **Contextual Content**: The bold text might contain links, footnotes, or other contextual content that we'll need to either include or exclude, depending on the requirements.\n\n8. **File Structure and Metadata**: There could be metadata or structural elements in the ORG file that are not part of the content but could be confused with bold text during parsing.\n\nTo handle these issues, the parser would need to have a robust set of rules and conditions to accurately identify and extract bold text while dealing with all these potential complexities."
