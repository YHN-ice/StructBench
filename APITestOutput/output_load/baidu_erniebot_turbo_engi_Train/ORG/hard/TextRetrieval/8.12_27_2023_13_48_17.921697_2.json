It is crucial to recognize all the formats that might be used (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and correctly identify these links within the file's content.\n\n2. **Link Formatting Variations:** Image links in ORG files can be formatted in different ways, such as inline links, descriptive links, or using different markup for embedding images. Ensuring that the parser can handle all variations is necessary.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** The file paths to images could be relative or absolute. An absolute path points directly to the location of a file on a filesystem, while a relative path specifies the file's location in relation to the directory where the ORG file is located. The parser needs to distinguish between these types.\n\n4. **File Path Escaping:** Special characters in file paths might be escaped or encoded, which would require decoding to extract the correct filename.\n\n5. **Non-image Files:** The ORG file might contain links to other types of files or resources which are not images. The parser should filter these out and only list image files.\n\n6. **Embedded Images from External Sources:** If images are embedded from external sources (like URLs), it might be necessary to decide if these should be included in the output or not.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors in the ORG File:** Syntax errors or typos in the ORG file might lead to incorrect or missed image file extractions.\n\n8. **Handling Duplicate Image Names:** There might be multiple references to the same image file. Depending on the requirement, you may need to filter out duplicates or list them each time they appear.\n\nOnce we have access to the input ORG file content, these factors will help guide the parsing process to accurately extract the image filenames.\n"
