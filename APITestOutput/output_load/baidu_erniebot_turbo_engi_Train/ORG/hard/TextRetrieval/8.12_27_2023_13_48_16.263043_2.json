It is necessary to handle all the possible syntaxes used to include images.\n\n2. **Image Formats**: The parser must recognize different image file formats (e.g., jpg, png, gif, svg) which could be included in the ORG file.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be included using absolute paths, relative paths, or URLs. The parser should correctly identify the file names regardless of the path type.\n\n4. **Link Descriptions**: ORG files can have descriptive texts for links which might not be part of the image file name. The parser should discern between link descriptions and the actual image file names.\n\n5. **Comments and Non-image Links**: There may be links in the ORG file that are commented out or are not image files. These should not be confused with active image links.\n\n6. **Embedded Base64 Images**: ORG files can potentially contain images encoded in Base64 format directly within the file. This case is complicated because these aren't referenced by file names but rather by the encoded data itself.\n\n7. **File Path Special Characters**: File paths may contain special characters that need to be handled correctly, such as spaces, parentheses, and escaped characters.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, we will need to carefully parse through it to extract all the image file names while navigating these potential difficulties."
