We need to ensure that the parser can recognize all methods used for bold formatting.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting styles, like italic, underlined, or code. The parser must be able to extract the bold text without including other formatting.\n\n3. **Partial Formatting**: There might be cases where only part of a word or phrase is bolded. The parser should accurately identify these cases and extract the bold part only.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Special characters within the bold text could disrupt the parsing, especially if they coincide with markup characters. The parser must handle these correctly.\n\n5. **Escaped Markup Characters**: Users may escape markup characters meant to be shown literally rather than interpreted as formatting. The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines. The parser should be able to detect and extract multiline bold text correctly.\n\n7. **Links or Footnotes Inside Bold Text**: If there are links or footnotes within bold text, the parser will need to decide whether to include or exclude these elements in the output.\n\n8. **Consistency in Output**: Ensuring that the extracted bold text is consistent in terms of whitespace and punctuation is important for accurate representation.\n\nIn order to ensure correct extraction, the parsing logic must be robust enough to handle all these cases. After seeing the input file, we would need to apply a specific set of rules to extract bold texts while considering these potential difficulties."
