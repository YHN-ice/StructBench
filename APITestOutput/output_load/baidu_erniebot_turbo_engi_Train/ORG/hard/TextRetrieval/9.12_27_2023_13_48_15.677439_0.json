It's important to know the exact syntax used for bold in the document.\n\n2. **Mixed Formatting**: Bold text might be combined with other formatting (like italic, underline, or code), which could complicate the extraction process if you're only interested in bold text.\n\n3. **Inline Codes**: There might be inline code blocks or snippets that use asterisks which could be mistakenly identified as bold text.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used for bold formatting might be escaped in some parts of the document, which means they shouldn't be treated as formatting characters.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must be able to handle this and still extract the full text correctly.\n\n6. **Lists, Headers, or Special Blocks**: Bold text could be part of list items, headers, or special blocks (like quote blocks or code blocks). It's important to differentiate whether the asterisks are denoting formatting or structure.\n\n7. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other bold text, which may result in confusion if the parser does not handle nested structures properly.\n\n8. **Links and Footnotes**: Bold text might include links or footnotes, which have their own syntax that needs to be preserved or appropriately processed during extraction.\n\n9. **Partial Bold Text**: Sometimes, only part of a word or phrase might be bolded, which needs careful handling to ensure only the correct portion is extracted.\n\n10. **Document Structure and Metadata**: The ORG file might contain metadata or structural elements that are not directly related to content formatting but could impact how text is parsed and extracted.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues is crucial for creating a robust parser that can accurately extract bold texts from an ORG file."
