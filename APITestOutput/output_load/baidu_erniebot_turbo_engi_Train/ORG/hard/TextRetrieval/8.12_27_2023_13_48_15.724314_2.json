These lines might follow a particular syntax pattern that includes the image file names. Here are some potential obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Variations in Image Link Formats**: The ORG file could include images using different formats or syntaxes. For example, images could be linked with org-mode syntax like `[[file:imagename.png]]` or using HTML-like tags `<img src=\"imagename.png\"/>`. Recognizing all possible variations is essential.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths could be given as relative links (like `images/picture.jpg`) or absolute URLs (such as `http://example.com/image.jpg`). We need to ensure that we're extracting the file names correctly in both cases.\n\n3. **Embedded Data URIs**: Sometimes images can be embedded directly in a document as data URIs, which are not file references but base64 encoded data. Recognizing and excluding these appropriately is necessary since they're not \"included image files\".\n\n4. **Commented Lines**: The ORG file might contain commented-out lines with image links that aren't actually meant to be parsed as part of the document's content.\n\n5. **File Name Confusion**: Non-image files could have names that might be mistaken for images, due to having a typical image extension (e.g., `archive.zip` named as `archive.jpg`), which could cause confusion.\n\n6. **Multiline Links**: Image links might be broken across multiple lines, which can complicate the extraction process if the parser expects a single-line format.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Images come in various formats (jpg, png, gif, etc.) and the parser must recognize all common image file extensions.\n\n8. **Special Characters and Spaces**: Filenames with special characters or spaces might be enclosed in different ways, such as using backslashes to escape spaces.\n\n9. **Syntax Errors in the Document**: There could be syntax errors made by the document's author that result in incorrectly formatted image links.\n\nAddressing these challenges would require a parser to be quite robust and have specific logic to handle each case. Now I'm ready to see the input file and proceed with extracting the image file names."
