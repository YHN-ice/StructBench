Ensuring all types are handled correctly can be a challenge.\n\n3. **Link Formats:** Images could be linked with different formats, such as Markdown-style links or HTML `<img>` tags. Identifying all possible formats is necessary to not miss any images.\n\n4. **Non-Image Links:** An ORG file may include links to non-image files or URLs that are not images. The parser must differentiate between image and non-image links.\n\n5. **Embedded Images:** Images can also be embedded directly in an ORG file as base64 encoded strings. Decoding and identifying these images might be more complex.\n\n6. **Comments and Directives:** The ORG file might contain commented-out lines or directives that change how images are displayed or included, which could affect image extraction.\n\n7. **Textual Noise:** There could be a lot of non-relevant text and formatting information within the ORG file which must be filtered out to extract only the image file names.\n\n8. **File Accessibility:** If the parser is also responsible for verifying the existence of the images, local file paths might point to files that do not exist or remote URLs may be broken.\n\nAddressing these challenges will require a systematic approach to accurately identify and extract the names of all included image files from the ORG file."
