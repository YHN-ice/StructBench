Depending on how images are included in the document, the parser needs to be able to recognize different syntaxes.\n\n2. **Embedded Images vs. Links**: Images could be embedded directly in the ORG file as base64 encoded data, or they could be linked from external sources. We would need to differentiate between these cases to extract actual file names.\n\n3. **File Path Complexity**: Image paths could be simple filenames, relative paths, or absolute paths, which increases the complexity of accurately extracting the file names.\n\n4. **Markup Confusion**: ORG files can contain a lot of markup for different purposes (e.g., for structuring the document, formatting text, etc.). It's important to not be misled by other markup elements that are not related to image inclusion.\n\n5. **External Resources**: If an ORG file includes images from the internet or other external sources, there might not be an actual 'file name' to extract without downloading the resource.\n\n6. **Diverse File Formats**: Image files can have various formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser must be prepared to recognize multiple image file extensions.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file content, so that I can attempt to parse it and extract the image file names."
