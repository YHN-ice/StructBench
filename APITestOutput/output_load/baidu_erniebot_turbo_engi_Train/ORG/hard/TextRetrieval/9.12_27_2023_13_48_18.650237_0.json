Identifying Bold Syntax: ORG files use specific syntax to denote bold text, usually surrounding the text with asterisks (e.g., `*bold*`). Parsing will require correctly identifying this syntax.\n\n2. Overlapping Formatting: Text may have overlapping formatting (like bold and italic), e.g., `/*bold and italic*/`, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. Partial Bold Text: There might be instances where only part of a word or phrase is bolded, which requires careful parsing to ensure that only the bold part is extracted and not the surrounding text.\n\n4. Multiline Bold Text: Bold text may span multiple lines, and the parser should be able to handle multiline formatting without breaking the bold text apart.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: Asterisks used as actual characters in the text (not for formatting) might be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n6. Nested Formatting: Bold text could be nested within other formatting blocks like lists, quotes, or source code blocks, which requires additional logic to correctly extract.\n\n7. Diverse Org Versions: Different versions of Org-mode might have slightly different formatting rules, which could affect the parser’s ability to accurately identify bold text.\n\nNow, please provide the ORG file content so I can proceed with parsing and extracting the bold texts."
