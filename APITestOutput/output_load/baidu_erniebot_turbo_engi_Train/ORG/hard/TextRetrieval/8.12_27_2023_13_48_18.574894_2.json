When parsing an ORG file and trying to extract all included image files, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Syntax Variation**: ORG files can include images using different syntaxes, such as links or inline display configurations. The parser must recognize all possible inclusion methods.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image references may be given as relative or absolute paths. A parser needs to handle both types and possibly normalize them if needed for further processing.\n\n3. **Comments and Inactive Links**: Images might be referenced within comments or in a form that is not intended to be an active link. The parser should differentiate between active image links and those that are not meant to be parsed.\n\n4. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images can also be embedded directly into ORG files using Base64 encoding. The parser would need to detect and possibly decode these if they are required.\n\n5. **External Resources**: Some images might be linked externally (URLs to web resources). The parser should decide whether to include these or focus on local files only.\n\n6. **File Format Identification**: It may be necessary to verify that the linked files are indeed image files by checking their extensions or even their headers/metadata.\n\n7. **Different Markup Environments**: The ORG file could be written with different markup languages embedded, like HTML or LaTeX, where the image inclusion syntax is different.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, it’s important for the parser to be designed with flexibility and comprehensive pattern recognition to accurately extract all included image file names."
