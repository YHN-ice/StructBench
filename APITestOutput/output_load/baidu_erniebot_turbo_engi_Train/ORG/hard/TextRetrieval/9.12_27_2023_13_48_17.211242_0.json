Differentiating between these can be challenging.\n\n3. **Partial Bold Text**: Some lines may contain both bold and non-bold text. The parser should be able to extract only the bold parts without including the non-bold text.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: If asterisks are used in the text for other purposes than marking bold text, and they are escaped properly, the parser should not interpret these as bold markers.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Asterisks might be used in the document for purposes other than text formatting (e.g., representing bullet points or literal asterisks in code blocks), which could lead to false positives.\n\nPlease provide the content or structure of the ORG file so that I can assist you further in extracting the bold texts."
