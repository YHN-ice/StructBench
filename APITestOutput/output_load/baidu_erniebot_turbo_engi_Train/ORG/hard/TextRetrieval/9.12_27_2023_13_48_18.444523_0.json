This can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: Bold texts that span multiple lines could pose a challenge since the parser needs to correctly identify the continuation of bold formatting across line breaks.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used for other purposes (like lists or headings) or escaped asterisks (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`) should not be mistaken for bold formatting.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Markers**: Text that contains asterisks not meant for bold formatting, such as bullet points or mathematical expressions, could be falsely identified as bold.\n\n6. **Contextual Formatting**: The meaning of asterisks might change based on context, requiring the parser to have some understanding of ORG syntax rules.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, the parser must have robust rules to identify the start and end of bold formatting while accounting for these potential issues.
