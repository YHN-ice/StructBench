A standard pattern is `*bold text*` for asterisks or `=bold text=` for verbatim text. Identifying these patterns amidst other text is essential.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underlined, or code blocks, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: There might be special or escape characters within the bold text that need to be handled appropriately.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Texts**: If a bold section spans multiple lines, it could be a challenge to extract it correctly since line breaks might be considered as the end of bold formatting in some parsers.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting**: The ORG file could have inconsistencies or errors in formatting where the bold syntax is not used correctly, making it difficult to extract accurately.\n\n6. **Contextual Understanding**: Without contextual understanding, it might be hard to determine if asterisks or equals signs are being used to denote bold text or for other purposes, like lists or dividing lines.\n\nTo accurately extract the bold texts given these potential difficulties, I would utilize regular expressions that match the patterns for bold text in ORG files while accounting for the above factors. However, since I am a text-based AI and do not have the capability to parse files directly, I can only provide guidance on how one would approach such a task programmatically.
