For example, images can be linked directly with a line starting with `[[file:path/to/image.ext]]` or they can be embedded within descriptive text.\n\n2. **Different file types**: Images can come in various formats such as `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, etc. The parser needs to recognize all these potential formats.\n\n3. **Relative vs absolute paths**: The image paths could be relative to the ORG file's location or absolute paths on the file system.\n\n4. **Multiple images on one line**: There could be lines that contain more than one image link, and the parser needs to extract each one separately.\n\n5. **Non-image file links**: The ORG file could also contain links to non-image files, so the parser will need to discern between image files and other types of files.\n\n6. **Inline images**: Images might be included inline with other text or org-mode constructs, which means the parser must be able to accurately identify and isolate the image file names in varied contexts.\n\n7. **Markup variations**: If the ORG file uses any custom or non-standard markup for including images, the parser must be able to handle these cases as well.\n\n8. **Comments and inactive links**: Some image links might be commented out or set as inactive links (with `:`, like `[[file:image.png]]`). The parser might need to decide whether to include or exclude these from the output.\n\nIf you provide a sample ORG file or further specify how images are included in the file you're asking about, I could give a more precise answer on how to extract those image filenames."
