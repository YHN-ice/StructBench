There might be direct links, or the images could be embedded using different syntax or markup conventions.\n\n2. **File path complexity**: Image paths in the ORG file could be absolute or relative, and could potentially include complex directory structures or special characters that need to be handled correctly.\n\n3. **Various link types**: Besides image files, ORG files can also include links to other types of files or URLs. The parser must distinguish between image file links and other content.\n\n4. **Image formats**: There may be multiple image formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and the parser should be configured to recognize all common image file extensions.\n\n5. **Link text and descriptions**: Sometimes links in ORG files have descriptive text alongside the actual URL or path which needs to be ignored when extracting just the filename.\n\n6. **In-line vs block images**: Images might be included in-line with text or as separate blocks. The parser needs to correctly identify both.\n\n7. **Comments and non-displayed content**: Parts of the ORG file may be comments or otherwise marked not to display; such image references may or may not need to be included based on the requirements.\n\n8. **Multi-line links**: Rarely, links could be broken across lines, which might complicate the parsing process.\n\n9. **Potential encoding issues**: If the ORG file uses a specific encoding, special characters in filenames might not be correctly interpreted without proper handling.\n\n10. **Error handling**: The parser should handle cases where the formatting is incorrect or unexpected input is encountered without crashing or providing incorrect output.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file, I can apply the appropriate parsing logic to extract the image filenames according to these considerations."
