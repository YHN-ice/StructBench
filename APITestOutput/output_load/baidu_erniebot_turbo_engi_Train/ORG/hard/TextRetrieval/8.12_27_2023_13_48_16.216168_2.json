Variations in image syntax: The syntax for including images might vary slightly, for example, with additional attributes or alternative formatting like `[[./images/imagename.png]]`.\n\n3. Relative vs. absolute paths: Images might be referenced using either relative or absolute paths, and the parser must handle both correctly.\n\n4. Multiple images on one line: There could be lines containing multiple images, and the parser must be able to extract each image filename individually.\n\n5. Ignoring non-image links: An ORG file might contain links to non-image files or URLs that should not be confused with image file links.\n\n6. Handling commented or inactive links: Image links might be commented out or marked as inactive (e.g., `#+BEGIN_COMMENT [[file:imagename.jpg]] #+END_COMMENT`), and these should not be extracted unless specified.\n\n7. File extensions: We must be aware of various image file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) to accurately identify image files.\n\nOnce the ORG file input is available, we can look for lines matching the patterns that indicate an image file inclusion, extract the filenames, and print them separated by a newline character."
