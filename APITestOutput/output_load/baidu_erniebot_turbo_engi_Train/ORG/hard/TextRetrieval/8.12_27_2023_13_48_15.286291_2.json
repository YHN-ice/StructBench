The parser must distinguish between image file links and other types of links.\n\n3. **Path Variations**: Image paths can be absolute, relative, or even contain variables or special characters that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n4. **Embedded Images**: Images might be included inline with base64 encoding rather than as file paths, and these would need to be identified separately.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Links**: The parser must differentiate between active image links and those that are commented out or otherwise inactive.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: The parser should correctly identify image files which might have a variety of file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif).\n\n7. **Markup Complexity**: ORG files can contain complex markup that may obscure or complicate the extraction process, such as nested structures or macros that generate links.\n\n8. **Multiline Links**: Sometimes links might be broken across lines for readability, and the parser should be able to handle these cases.\n\n9. **Encoding Issues**: The file might have encoding issues that could interfere with correctly parsing the text for image file names.\n\n10. **Custom Syntax**: Users can define their own syntax or use plugins that alter the default behavior of ORG mode, potentially complicating the parsing process.\n\nTo effectively extract the image file names, the parser must account for these challenges and ensure that it can recognize and extract the relevant information accurately from the provided ORG file input."
