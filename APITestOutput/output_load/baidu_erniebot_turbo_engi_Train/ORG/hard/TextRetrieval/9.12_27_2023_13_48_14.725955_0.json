However, there can be variations like using more asterisks or other characters that might be mistaken for bold syntax.\n\n2. **Adjacent Formatting**: Bold text might be adjacent to other formatting elements like italics, underlines, or code blocks. Parsing needs to accurately identify only the bold text while ignoring or properly handling adjacent formatting.\n\n3. **Text within Lists or Headings**: Bold text could appear within list items or headings. The parser must recognize these contexts and still correctly extract the bold text.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that would normally indicate formatting, like an asterisk, might be escaped to display literally rather than as formatting. The parser needs to distinguish between actual formatting cues and escaped characters.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: Bold text might span across lines or include significant whitespace that should be preserved or appropriately handled during extraction.\n\n6. **Embedded Content**: The bold text might include links, footnotes, or other embedded content that may complicate straightforward text extraction.\n\n7. **Non-Standard Extensions**: Custom or non-standard extensions to the ORG format might introduce new ways to denote bold text that the parser isn't programmed to recognize.\n\nGiven these potential issues, it's important to establish a clear understanding of the specific ORG mode syntax rules for denoting bold text before attempting to parse and extract it."
