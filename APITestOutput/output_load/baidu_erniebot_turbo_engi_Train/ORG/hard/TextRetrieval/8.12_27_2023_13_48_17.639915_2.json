For instance, the links could be wrapped in different ways or use differing conventions for specifying the path to the image file.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: The file paths of the images could be complex, including relative paths, absolute paths, or even URLs. This complexity can make it harder to accurately extract just the file name.\n\n3. **Multiple Formats**: Images can come in various formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and some files may not be easily identifiable by their extension.\n\n4. **Non-image Links**: An ORG file might contain links to non-image files or external websites that do not represent image files. These need to be distinguished from actual image files.\n\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Sometimes, images are embedded directly into files as Base64 encoded strings rather than linked as separate files. Extracting these would require decoding and potentially saving the data as separate image files.\n\n6. **File Name Conflicts**: There could be multiple images with the same name but located in different directories. Care must be taken to handle these potential conflicts.\n\n7. **Markup and Comments**: The image links could be within markup or commented out, which means they shouldn't be extracted as they are not part of the visible content.\n\nTo ensure accurate extraction, the parser will need to carefully identify the correct patterns that signify image file links and cleanly extract just the file names while handling all these potential issues."
