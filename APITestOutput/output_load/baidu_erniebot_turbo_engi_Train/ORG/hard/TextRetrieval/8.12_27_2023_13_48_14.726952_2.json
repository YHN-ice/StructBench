Being able to differentiate between valid image links and other content is essential.\n\n5. **Embedded Images** : Some images might be embedded as base64 encoded data directly within the ORG file, which would require different handling than image file links.\n\n6. **Nonstandard Extensions**: While most image files might have standard extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., some might be using nonstandard or less common extensions, which need to be considered when filtering for image files.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on a Line**: There could be multiple images linked on a single line, which may be trickier to parse correctly without missing any.\n\n8. **Subtleties in ORG Syntax**: ORG files have their own syntax for including images, which could have subtle variations – recognizing these correctly is important for accurate parsing.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file content that needs to be parsed so I can proceed with extracting the included image file names."
