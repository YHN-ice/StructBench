Nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underline, or code blocks. Parsing nested formatting correctly can be challenging.\n\n3. Special characters: Bold sections might include special characters or escape sequences that need to be handled properly during parsing.\n\n4. Variations in syntax: Depending on the tool or version used to create the ORG file, there might be variations in the syntax for bold text. This could include different markers or ways of indicating boldness.\n\n5. Multiline bold text: Bold text may span across multiple lines, requiring a parser to handle multiline patterns.\n\n6. Textual content resembling formatting: There could be textual content that resembles formatting markers but isn't intended to denote bold text, which could lead to false positives.\n\nThe task would involve recognizing the correct pattern that denotes bold text in ORG files (commonly asterisks like *bold*), extracting the content within these markers, and printing them out while separating each bold section with a newline character."
