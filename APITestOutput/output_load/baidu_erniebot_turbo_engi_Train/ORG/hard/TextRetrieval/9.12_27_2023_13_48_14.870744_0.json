Parsing nested formatting correctly to extract only the bold portions could be challenging.\n\n3. **Multiline bold text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser needs to be able to handle line breaks within bold sections without mistaking them for separate elements.\n\n4. **Escape characters**: Asterisks used for other purposes might be escaped (e.g., \\*not bold\\*), and the parser will need to recognize and ignore these.\n\n5. **Special ORG features**: ORG mode supports features like drawers, blocks, and links that might contain asterisks or other formatting characters. These should not be confused with bold text markup.\n\n6. **Version or implementation differences**: There might be differences in how bold text is represented in different versions of ORG mode or different software implementing ORG-like syntax.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, it's important for the parsing logic to be robust and account for these variations to accurately extract all bold texts."
