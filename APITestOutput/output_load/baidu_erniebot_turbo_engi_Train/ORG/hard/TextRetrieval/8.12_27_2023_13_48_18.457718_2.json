We'll need to properly interpret these to extract the correct file names.\n\n3. **Embedded Code Blocks**: ORG files can contain code blocks that might include strings that look like image file names but aren't meant to be treated as such. It's important to distinguish between image references and strings within code blocks.\n\n4. **Image References in Comments**: There could be image references within comment lines in the ORG file that might not be intended as actual images to display.\n\n5. **File Name Escaping**: Some file names might include characters that need to be escaped, which could affect the ability to extract them correctly.\n\n6. **Links Description Text**: Image links might have descriptive text that is not part of the file name. This text should be ignored when extracting the file names.\n\n7. **Multiline Links**: Sometimes links can be broken over multiple lines for formatting reasons. The parser would need to handle these cases properly.\n\n8. **Hidden Metadata**: ORG files can contain metadata that isn't displayed when viewed in an editor but can still contain references to files.\n\nAs we move forward, keeping these potential issues in mind will help us ensure accuracy when parsing and extracting image file names from the ORG file provided."
