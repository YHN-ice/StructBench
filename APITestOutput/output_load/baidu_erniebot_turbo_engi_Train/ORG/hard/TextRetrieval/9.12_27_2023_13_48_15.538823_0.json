Differentiating between these uses and actual bold text will be necessary.\n\n5. **Escape Characters:** Some bold texts might contain escape characters that need to be handled properly during extraction.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, precise parsing rules will need to be defined to accurately identify and extract the bold texts from the ORG file content.
