However, depending on the settings or user habits, other markers might be used, which should be recognized by the parser.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underlined, or code snippets. The parser must correctly identify and extract only the bold portions without being confused by other formatting.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks or other formatting characters are escaped within the text to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting. The parser must distinguish between actual formatting and literals.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold texts could span multiple lines or even paragraphs. The parser must correctly handle these cases without breaking the text at line boundaries unless intended.\n\n5. **File Size and Complexity**: Large or complex ORG files with many elements of text formatting might slow down the parsing process or complicate the extraction of specific text styles.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we can proceed with the task once the input ORG file content is provided."
