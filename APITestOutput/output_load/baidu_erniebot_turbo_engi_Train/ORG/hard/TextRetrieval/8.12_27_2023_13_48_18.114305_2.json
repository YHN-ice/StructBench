For example, links might be plain (`file:image.jpg`) or descriptive (`[[file:image.jpg][description]]`). The parser must handle these variations correctly.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths might be relative to the location of the ORG file or absolute paths on the file system. The parser should be able to identify both types.\n\n3. **Embedded Images vs. Links**: Images might be embedded directly within the ORG document or linked from external sources. The parser needs to distinguish between these and extract only the relevant file names.\n\n4. **Non-image File Links**: ORG files may also include links to non-image files or URLs. These need to be filtered out to only retrieve image file names.\n\n5. **Markup Around Image Links**: Image links may be surrounded by various types of markup for formatting purposes, which can complicate extraction.\n\n6. **Commented Out or Inactive Links**: The ORG file might have commented out links or inactive links that should not be included in the extraction.\n\n7. **Multiple Image Links on a Single Line**: There may be multiple image links on a single line, so the parser will need to correctly identify and separate each image link.\n\nBy considering these potential issues ahead of time, the parser can be designed to robustly handle different scenarios that may arise within an ORG file."
