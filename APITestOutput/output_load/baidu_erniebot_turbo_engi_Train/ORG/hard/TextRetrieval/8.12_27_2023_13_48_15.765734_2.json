We need to ensure that we can recognize all possible ways images can be embedded.\n\n2. **File Paths**: Images can be included with absolute or relative paths, and handling different path structures might be challenging.\n\n3. **Link Types**: Some images might be included as hyperlinks, while others may be embedded directly; distinguishing between these types is important.\n\n4. **File Formats**: There are various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, .svg), and the parser should be ready to identify all of them.\n\n5. **Comments and Non-image Links**: ORG files might contain comments or links to non-image files that could be mistakenly identified as images if the parser is not careful.\n\n6. **Capturing Only File Names**: The requirement is to extract only the file names, so any additional link text or markup must be excluded from the output.\n\n7. **Line Breaks and Wrapping Text**: An image link might be broken across lines or surrounded by text, which could make it harder to reliably extract just the image file name.\n\n8. **Embedded Content**: Some images might not be linked as files but rather embedded in the document through different means (e.g., base64 encoded), which might not have conventional file names.\n\n9. **Multiple Images on One Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line, requiring the parser to handle multiple matches in a single line of text.\n\n10. **Cross-references and Descriptions**: ORG files allow for descriptive text and cross-references, which could lead to false positives if the parser does not account for these.\n\nUnderstanding these potential challenges will help us design a robust parsing strategy to accurately extract image file names from the ORG file content. Now, please provide the org file content to begin the extraction process."
