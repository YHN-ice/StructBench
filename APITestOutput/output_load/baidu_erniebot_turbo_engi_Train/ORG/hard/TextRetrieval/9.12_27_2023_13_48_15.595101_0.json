Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Complex Syntax:** ORG files can contain a mix of plain text, to-do lists, tables, timestamps, links, and various markup for formatting, such as bold, italic, underline, etc. Bold text can be marked in different ways (e.g., wrapping text with asterisks or using specific markup tags), which can make it tricky to extract.\n\n2. **Ambiguity in Markup:** Depending on the context, the same markup can represent different things. For example, asterisks (*) are used for bold text but also for list items. Determining the correct interpretation requires understanding the context.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text may be nested within other formatting elements or constructs like lists, tables, or even within other bold texts. This necessitates a parser that can handle recursive structures or nested formatting.\n\n4. **Variants in Bold Markers:** Different configurations or versions of ORG mode may use different markers or conventions for bold text, so the parser needs to be adaptable or aware of these variants.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Spans:** Text formatting can span multiple lines or be broken by line breaks, which may complicate the detection of the beginning and end of the formatted text.\n\n6. **Special Characters:** Special characters that are part of the bold text need to be handled correctly without confusing them for markup characters.\n\n7. **Misformatted Text:** Sometimes the source ORG file might contain errors or misformatted text where the bold markers are not properly paired or closed. The parser may need a strategy to deal with such inconsistencies.\n\nTo accurately parse and extract bold texts from an ORG file, a parser needs to account for these challenges and have clear rules or algorithms to differentiate between various elements and formatting within the file."
