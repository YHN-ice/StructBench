We should be prepared to recognize multiple image file extensions.\n\n2. **Inline Images vs. Attachments:** Images in ORG files can be linked inline within the text or as attachments. The parser must handle both types of references.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Image files might be included with relative or absolute paths. The parser needs to correctly identify the file names in either case.\n\n4. **Linked URLs vs. Local Files:** Some images might not be local files but rather URLs to images hosted online. We need to distinguish between local file paths and URLs.\n\n5. **Syntax Variability:** The syntax to include images in ORG files might vary, and there could be different ways to reference images (e.g., using `[[file:path/to/image.jpg]]`, `#+CAPTION:`, `#+ATTR_ORG:` etc.). The parser must recognize all the possible syntaxes.\n\n6. **Textual References that are Not Images:** There might be other file references or links that are not image files but have a similar syntax. The parser must differentiate between image files and other links.\n\n7. **Org-mode Specific Constructs:** ORG mode allows for constructs like drawers and blocks that may contain file references, which should be considered by the parser.\n\n8. **Comments and Inactive Links:** The ORG file might contain commented code or inactive links which should not be treated as actual image links.\n\n9. **Encoding and Format of the ORG File:** If the ORG file is not properly encoded or if the file has formatting issues, it could cause the parser to misinterpret the contents.\n\nEach of these potential issues requires careful consideration to ensure accurate parsing of the ORG file and proper extraction of image file names."
