Some potential difficulties and obstacles could include:\n\n1. **Different Formatting for Bold Text:** ORG files can use different syntax to denote bold text, such as using asterisks (*) or equal signs (=) around the text. It's important to know the correct format used for bold in the ORG file.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text may be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. The parser needs to correctly ignore the other formatting while extracting the bold text.\n\n3. **Multi-line Bold Blocks:** Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser will need to handle line breaks properly.\n\n4. **Special Characters:** Bold text might include special characters or markup that needs to be handled or ignored during parsing, depending on the desired output.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Use of Markup:** Sometimes, the syntax may not be used consistently, which could lead to missing some bold text during extraction.\n\n6. **Escape Characters:** The ORG file might contain escape characters that are used to prevent certain markup from being parsed. These need to be identified and handled correctly.\n\nEach of these could complicate the process of extracting bold texts from an ORG file. To address these, a parser must be robust enough to recognize and handle various edge cases and variations in formatting."
