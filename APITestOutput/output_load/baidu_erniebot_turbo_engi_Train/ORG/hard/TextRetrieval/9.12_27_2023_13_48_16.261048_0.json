The most common ways are wrapping the text in asterisks (e.g., `*bold*`), but there could be variations or custom syntax in use.\n\n2. **Complex Formatting**: Bold text could be part of a more complex formatting structure, such as within a list, a table, or nested within other markup elements like links or italics. This can complicate the parsing process if the parser is not designed to handle these structures.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for other formatting purposes, such as creating lists or defining headers. It's possible that asterisks could be misinterpreted as indicating bold text when they serve a different function.\n\n4. **Embedded Code or Examples**: ORG files often contain code blocks or example blocks where asterisks might not be intended to represent formatting at all but are part of the code or example content.\n\n5. **File Encoding**: If the file encoding is not standard UTF-8 or if it contains special characters, it might not be parsed correctly without accounting for the correct encoding.\n\n6. **Incomplete or Broken Markup**: Sometimes, an ORG file might have incomplete markup where an asterisk intended to make text bold is missing its counterpart, which can lead to difficulty in determining what text should be bold.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape asterisks to use them as literal characters rather than formatting, which the parser would need to account for.\n\nAddressing these challenges typically requires a robust parsing strategy that can accurately interpret ORG file syntax and context. If you can provide the actual input file or the content of the ORG file you're referring to, I can proceed with extracting the bold texts for you."
