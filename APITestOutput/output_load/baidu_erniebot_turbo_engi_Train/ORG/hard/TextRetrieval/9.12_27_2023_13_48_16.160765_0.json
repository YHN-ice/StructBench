Commonly, asterisks (*) are used, but the exact formatting might vary (e.g., `*bold*` or `**bold**`). It's important to be aware of the correct formatting to accurately extract the text.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other formatting elements (italics, underlines, etc.), which might complicate extraction. I would need to ensure that only the bold formatting is considered and other formats don't interfere with the process.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: The bold text might include special characters or markup that needs to be handled correctly, such as links, footnotes, or inline code.\n\n4. **Line Breaks**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it might be challenging to extract it correctly without losing the intended formatting or including unwanted line breaks.\n\n5. **Embedded Code or Source Blocks**: ORG files can contain code or source blocks that might use asterisks in a way that's unrelated to text formatting. It will be important to differentiate between these blocks and actual bold text.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Users might use escape characters to include literal asterisks in their text without intending to make it bold. Correctly interpreting these escape sequences will be crucial.\n\n7. **Incomplete or Incorrect Formatting**: Sometimes users make mistakes in their formatting, which could lead to partial bold text or incorrectly closed tags. Deciding how to handle these cases might be necessary.\n\nOnce provided with the actual ORG file content, I would apply the logic to handle these potential issues and extract the bold text accordingly."
