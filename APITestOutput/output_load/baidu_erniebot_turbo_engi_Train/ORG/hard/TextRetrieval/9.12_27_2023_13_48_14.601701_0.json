Typically, * or ** are used to make text bold. Therefore, the parser must correctly identify the pattern that signifies bold text.\n\n2. **Handling Nested Formatting:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as underlined or italicized text or within code blocks. The parser must distinguish between these cases and extract only the bold text.\n\n3. **Dealing with Partially Bold Text:** A line may contain both bold and non-bold text. The parser should be able to extract only the bold parts without including the surrounding non-bold text.\n\n4. **Consistency in Bold Markers:** The parser must ensure that the start and end markers for bold text are consistent and paired correctly in the document. Unpaired markers could lead to incorrect extractions.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text:** If bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must be able to recognize this and extract the text as a single bolded section.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters:** Org mode allows escaping of special characters using a backslash (\\). The parser must handle these properly so that escaped markers are not mistakenly interpreted as formatting.\n\nOnce you provide me with an ORG file or its content, I can guide you through the process of extracting the bold texts according to these potential difficulties."
