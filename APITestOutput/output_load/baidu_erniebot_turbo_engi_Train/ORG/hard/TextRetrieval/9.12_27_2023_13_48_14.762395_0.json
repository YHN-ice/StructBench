However, the number of asterisks and their placement can vary (e.g., `*bold*` or `**bold**`). We need to know the correct syntax used in the file to identify bold text accurately.\n\n2. **Handling False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as for creating headings or list items. Distinguishing between bold text and other elements that use asterisks is required to avoid false positives.\n\n3. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, so the parser must be capable of handling such cases without breaking the text into multiple parts.\n\n4. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested with other formatting options like italic or underlined text. The parser should extract only the bold portion without including other formatting markers.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: The parser must handle escape characters that might be used to include literal asterisks in the text without indicating bold formatting.\n\n6. **Encoding and File Format**: The file encoding must be considered to ensure that the characters are read correctly. Additionally, the parser should handle any file format-specific nuances that could affect text extraction.\n\n7. **Incomplete or Malformed Formatting**: If there's incomplete or malformed bold syntax in the file (e.g., missing closing asterisk), the parser should either handle it gracefully or report it as an error.\n\n8. **Complex Document Structure**: ORG files can have complex structures with metadata, links, and other elements. The parser needs to navigate through these to find and extract only the bold texts.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we can tailor our approach to address these challenges appropriately."
