Each variation will require different parsing logic.\n\n2. **Inline Image Formatting**: Images can be included inline with text, which means the parser must be able to differentiate between image file paths and regular text or other inline elements.\n\n3. **Link Types**: ORG files can contain links to local files as well as URLs. The parser must distinguish between these and only extract local image file names if that's the requirement.\n\n4. **File Path Complexity**: File paths can include directories, relative paths, or be obscured by variables or shorthand in org mode. The parser must resolve these to actual file names.\n\n5. **Embedded Image Data**: Rarely, an image might be included as base64 encoded data directly in the file. This would require decoding to identify the file type and name.\n\n6. **Comments and Non-Image Links**: The parser must ignore non-image links and content that is commented out or otherwise not intended to display an image.\n\n7. **Multiple Image Formats Support**: The parser must recognize various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.).\n\n8. **Org Mode Directives**: Org files can contain directives that might affect how images are presented or whether they are included in exports. The parser should consider these if they affect the extraction process.\n\nTo accurately extract all image file names, the parser will need to handle these challenges effectively. Please provide the ORG file content so I can proceed with extracting the image files' names."
