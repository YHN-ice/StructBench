Identifying all possible formatting styles is essential.\n\n2. **Nested Markup**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements like italic, underline, or code blocks. The parser needs to recognize and handle nested structures appropriately to ensure only the bold text is extracted.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: The text within bold formatting might contain special characters or symbols that could be mistaken for formatting markers. The parser must differentiate between actual formatting markers and content.\n\n4. **Line Breaks and Whitespaces**: Line breaks and whitespaces can impact how the markup is interpreted. Consistent handling of these will be important for correct extraction.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Users might escape formatting characters to display them as literals rather than formatting, which the parser must account for.\n\n6. **Contextual Formatting**: Some bold formatting might be context-dependent, such as within tables or specific header levels, requiring more complex parsing logic.\n\nAssuming these potential difficulties, a parser should carefully interpret the markup to extract bold texts correctly, ensuring to handle edge cases and variations in formatting."
