However, there could be variations like multiple asterisks or other markup that might be used for bolding, which I would need to recognize.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements such as italic, underline, or code blocks. Properly isolating the bold text in these situations can be challenging.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for creating lists or sections in ORG files. I have to distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Line Breaks**: If the bold text is broken up by line breaks or continues across multiple lines, it might not be detected correctly without proper handling of line continuations.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes asterisks might be escaped to show literal asterisk characters instead of indicating bold text. These should not be mistaken for formatting.\n\n6. **File Read Errors**: Issues with file encoding or read permissions could prevent access to the file content.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Markup**: Users might not strictly follow the formatting rules, which could lead to inconsistencies in how bold text is marked up.\n\n8. **Comments and Directives**: Some lines might be comments or directives that contain asterisks but are not meant to be parsed as content.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I'll need to handle these potential issues accordingly to extract all bold texts successfully."
