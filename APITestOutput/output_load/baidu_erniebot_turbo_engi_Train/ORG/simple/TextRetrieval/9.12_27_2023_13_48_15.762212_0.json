When parsing an ORG file to extract bold texts, we might encounter several potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. **Syntax Variability**: ORG mode supports different ways to denote bold text (e.g., surrounding text with '*' or using markup specific to export back-ends). We need to account for all possible syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested Markup**: Bold text in ORG files might be nested within other markup, like links, italic, or code snippets. Extracting the bold text without including surrounding markup can be challenging.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used for other purposes than bold formatting might be escaped (e.g., \\*not bold\\*), and should not be mistaken as bold markers.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Lines with asterisks might also represent section headings or list items instead of bold text, which could lead to incorrect extraction if not properly identified.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts**: Bold text could span multiple lines, and the parser must be able to detect and correctly concatenate these lines.\n\n6. **Incomplete Markers**: There might be cases where the markers for bold text are not properly closed (e.g., missing an asterisk at the end), resulting in ambiguity about what is intended to be bold.\n\n7. **Contextual Meaning**: Some texts might appear to be bold due to their placement or formatting, but are not explicitly marked as such in the file's syntax (e.g., the title of a table).\n\n8. **Embedded Content**: Bold text might include embedded content such as images or footnotes, which could complicate extraction.\n\n9. **File Encoding and Character Sets**: The file encoding must be correctly interpreted to ensure that all characters, especially non-ASCII ones, are handled correctly.\n\nEach of these issues would require specific handling in the parsing logic to ensure accurate extraction of bold text from the ORG file. Now please provide the input file or the sample text from which you'd like me to extract the bold texts."
