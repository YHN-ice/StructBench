It's important to differentiate between these uses.\n2. **Embedded Formatting:** Bold text might be embedded within other formatting elements like links, italics, or code blocks. Parsing the bold text correctly without including surrounding formatting requires understanding the context.\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks intended to represent literal asterisks may be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which should not be confused with bold formatting.\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts:** If bold texts span multiple lines, they need to be captured in their entirety, which can be tricky if the parser is line-based.\n5. **Complex Structures**: ORG files can include complex hierarchical structures with different levels of headings and nesting. Parsing bold text within this structure requires respecting the hierarchy.\n\nHaving these potential difficulties in mind can help in formulating a robust method for extracting the bold texts from an ORG file. Now, please provide the ORG file input that you would like me to parse for bold texts."
