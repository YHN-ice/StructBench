The parser must recognize the correct syntax used to denote bold (typically, text surrounded by asterisks, like `*bold*`).\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could be nested within other formatting styles, like italic or underlined text. The parser must handle these situations correctly and extract only the bold parts.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks in ORG files might be used for other purposes, such as list items or headings. The parser needs to discern between asterisks used for bold formatting and those used for structuring the document.\n\n4. **Partial Bold Text**: Sometimes, only a portion of a word or phrase might be bolded, which could complicate extraction.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: If the bold text includes special characters or escape sequences, the parser must handle them appropriately.\n\n6. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines in an ORG file, and the parser should be able to handle multiline formatting without breaking the text apart incorrectly.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will attempt to extract all bold texts while addressing these potential challenges."
