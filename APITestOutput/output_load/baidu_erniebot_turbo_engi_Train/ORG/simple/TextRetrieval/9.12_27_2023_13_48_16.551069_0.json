The parser needs to correctly identify the syntax used for bold text, which is typically either *bold* or **bold**, depending on the convention used in the file.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italic, underline, or code blocks. We need to ensure that only the bold text is extracted and other formatting is not included in the output.\n\n3. **Incomplete Formatting**: There may be instances where the bold formatting is started but not properly closed with matching asterisks. These could potentially lead to parsing errors.\n\n4. **Asterisk Usage**: Asterisks are also used for list items and other formatting in ORG files, so the parser must distinguish between asterisks used for lists and those used for bold formatting.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: The parser needs to handle escaped asterisks (\\*) that are not meant for bold formatting but rather as literal asterisks in the text.\n\n6. **Context and Structure**: ORG files are structured with headings, lists, and other elements. Bold text could appear in various contexts, and it might be necessary to consider this structure when parsing.\n\n7. **Line Breaks and Continuations**: Bold text might span multiple lines, or there might be line breaks within a section of bold text. The parser should handle these cases correctly.\n\n8. **Consistency in Parsing**: If there are multiple bold segments on a single line, they should all be extracted correctly.\n\nAddressing these obstacles requires a careful design of the parsing logic that can accurately identify and extract the bold text while ignoring false positives and handling the complexities of the ORG file format."
