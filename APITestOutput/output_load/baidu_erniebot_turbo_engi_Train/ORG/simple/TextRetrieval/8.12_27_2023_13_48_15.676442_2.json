Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **File Path Conventions**: Image files could be linked using various path conventions, such as relative paths, absolute paths, or even URLs. We must be prepared to handle different formats.\n\n2. **Markup Variability**: ORG files use a plain text markup language, and there might be variability in how images are included, such as using different markup tags or formats.\n\n3. **Image File Extensions**: We need to identify what constitutes an image file. Common image extensions include .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, etc. However, there could be other less common extensions or even custom ones.\n\n4. **Link Syntax**: ORG mode uses specific syntax to include links (e.g., `[[file:imagename.ext]]`). We need to accurately identify this syntax to ensure we only extract image file names.\n\n5. **Embedded Images vs. Linked Images**: ORG files might embed images directly in the text or link to external files. We must distinguish between the two.\n\n6. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: There might be lines that include multiple image links. We should be ready to handle these cases and extract each image file name individually.\n\n7. **Non-Image File Links**: There may be links to non-image files in the ORG file. It's important to filter out links that do not point to image files.\n\nOnce you provide the input ORG file content, I can parse it for image file names considering the above potential issues."
