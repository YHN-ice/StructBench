In an ORG file, text is often made bold by wrapping it with asterisks `*`. A potential obstacle in this process includes:\n\n- **Multiple Formatting Styles**: If the ORG file uses different or non-standard conventions for bold text (other than the typical `*text*` format), it might be difficult to identify all bold texts correctly.\n- **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might also contain other formatting, like `/italic/` or `_underline_`, which could complicate the extraction process.\n- **Asterisks Used for Other Purposes**: Asterisks can be used for other purposes in an ORG file, such as for list items or headings. It's important to distinguish these from bold formatting.\n- **Multi-line Bold Text**: Sometimes, bold text might span across multiple lines, which could make the pattern recognition more complex.\n- **Special Characters**: The presence of special characters within the bold text could affect the matching process.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will be able to specifically identify the bold texts by analyzing the formatting patterns present in the file."
