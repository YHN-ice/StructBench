However, if the ORG file is not strictly following this notation or if it uses alternative markdown styles, identifying bold texts could be challenging.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italic or underlined text. Parsing such nested formatting correctly without losing the bold marking can be tricky.\n\n3. **Asterisks within text**: Since asterisks are used for marking bold text, any asterisk within the text that is not intended for formatting (e.g., in a mathematical context or as a bullet point) could cause confusion during parsing.\n\n4. **Line breaks and whitespace**: If the bold text spans multiple lines or contains additional whitespace, it may require a more complex parsing strategy to capture the entire bold section without breaking it up incorrectly.\n\n5. **Incomplete or improperly closed formatting**: If the document contains errors where the bold formatting is not correctly closed with asterisks, it may lead to incorrect parsing, either by extending the bold section too far or not recognizing it at all.\n\nAddressing these obstacles would require implementing a robust parsing algorithm that can handle various edge cases and ensure accurate extraction of bold text from the ORG file."
