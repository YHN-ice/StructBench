If there are variations or inconsistencies in how bold text is marked up, it could complicate the extraction process.\n\n2. **Embedded Formatting:** Bold text may contain other formatting or be nested within other elements, such as links or code blocks. This could require more complex parsing to isolate just the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes, asterisks might be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`) to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting markers. The parser needs to differentiate between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **False Positives:** Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as list items or headings. Ensuring that the parser only extracts bold text and not these other elements could be challenging.\n\n5. **Line Breaks and Whitespace:** Bold text that spans multiple lines or includes significant whitespace might require special handling to ensure that the extracted text maintains its intended formatting and coherence.\n\n6. **File Integrity and Complexity:** An improperly formatted ORG file or one with very complex structures could present difficulties in accurately parsing and extracting the desired information.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing strategy that can handle different cases and exceptions will need to be employed. Once the input file is provided, I will apply such strategies to extract the bold texts as accurately as possible within the limitations of my capabilities as a text-based AI assistant without actual parsing capabilities."
