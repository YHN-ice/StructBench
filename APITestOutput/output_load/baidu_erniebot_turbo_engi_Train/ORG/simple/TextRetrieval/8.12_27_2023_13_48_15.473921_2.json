Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract image filenames from an ORG file:\n\n1. **File Path Variations**: Images could be included using different path structures, such as relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs. Each of these may require different parsing strategies.\n\n2. **Image File Formats**: There are various image formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and the parser should be able to recognize all the possible image file extensions.\n\n3. **Link Formatting**: In ORG files, images can be included using links. The parser must correctly identify the link syntax that indicates an image file.\n\n4. **Embedded Images**: Images might be embedded directly into the document in base64 or other encoding formats, which would be more complex to extract as filenames.\n\n5. **Markup Variability**: ORG files can include a lot of markup, and the syntax for including images might vary slightly, e.g., with different attributes or within different contexts (like within a block or inline).\n\n6. **Non-image Links**: The parser needs to differentiate between image files and other types of links to avoid false positives.\n\n7. **Comments and Inactive Blocks**: Image links could be within commented sections or inactive code blocks, depending on how you want to handle these, they may or may not be considered as part of the output.\n\n8. **Textual References**: Sometimes, image filenames might be mentioned in the text without being actual links to image files; distinguishing between these cases could be challenging.\n\nOnce we see the input, we'll need to apply strategies to navigate these potential issues successfully."
