Identifying bold syntax: ORG files typically use asterisks (*) to denote bold text. It is essential to understand the correct syntax, as asterisks can also be used for other purposes such as bullet points or section headings.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text may be nested within other formatting, such as italic or underlined text, or within links. This requires careful parsing to ensure only the bold text is extracted.\n\n3. Partially bold text: Sometimes, only part of a sentence or phrase may be bold, which can complicate extraction if looking for standalone bold blocks.\n\n4. Variations in formatting: Users could potentially use different conventions for bold text if they are not strictly following the standard ORG mode formatting rules.\n\n5. Multiline bold text: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which requires handling line breaks appropriately.\n\n6. Escaped asterisks: Asterisks that are meant to be shown as literal characters rather than formatting must be correctly ignored.\n\n7. Handling errors or unconventional use of syntax: The ORG file may contain errors or unconventional uses of the syntax that the parser needs to handle gracefully.\n\n8. Encoding issues: The file's character encoding could affect how text is read and interpreted.\n\nOnce you provide the input ORG file content, I will attempt to identify and extract the bold texts while navigating these potential challenges."
