In ORG files, text is typically emphasized by wrapping it with asterisks, with double asterisks denoting bold text. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that we might encounter:\n\n1. **Complex Formatting**: If the file contains other forms of complex formatting that look similar to bold markers, it could be challenging to distinguish between them without a proper parsing strategy.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italic or underlined text. Recognizing bold text within such nesting could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: The file might include escape characters that prevent certain asterisks from being interpreted as formatting.\n\n4. **Partial Formatting**: There could be cases where the formatting is not properly closed, leading to ambiguity in what should be considered bold text.\n\n5. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which would require a multiline parsing approach.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Usage**: Users might not have consistently applied formatting, leading to cases where bold markers are missing or incorrectly used.\n\n7. **Special Cases**: There could be special cases where the syntax for bold text is customized or different from the standard double asterisks, depending on the version of Org-mode or user-specific configurations.\n\nWe would need to consider these challenges when parsing the ORG file to ensure accurate extraction of bold texts."
