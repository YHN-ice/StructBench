It is essential to recognize all of them, which may include links, inline representations, or attachment references.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image files could be referenced with either relative or absolute paths. The parser must correctly interpret both to extract the filenames.\n\n3. **Linked vs. Embedded Images**: Images might not always be embedded directly in the ORG file but could be linked from external sources. In such cases, distinguishing between external URLs and file paths is necessary.\n\n4. **Multiple References**: An image file might be referenced multiple times in the document. The parser should ideally list each file once, avoiding duplicates.\n\n5. **Non-image File Inclusions**: The ORG file might contain links or references to non-image files, which should be filtered out so that only image file names are extracted.\n\n6. **Markup Complexity**: ORG files may contain complex markup that can obfuscate image references, such as within commented sections, code blocks, or macros that may not be straightforward to parse without a proper understanding of context.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: The parser needs to consider various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) when identifying image files.\n\n8. **Embedded Base64 Images**: If images are embedded directly in the ORG file as Base64 encoded strings, it could be complex to extract and identify them as separate image files.\n\nIt's important for the parser to handle these potential issues to successfully extract all included image file names from the provided ORG content."
