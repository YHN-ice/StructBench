Commonly, links are surrounded by double square brackets with the \"file:\" prefix followed by the path.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Images might be included using relative or absolute paths. If the task is to provide filenames, it will be necessary to parse these correctly to extract just the name of the file.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: There might be different file extensions for the images (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser would need to recognize all possible image formats.\n\n4. **Image Links within Text**: Sometimes, images might be included within descriptive text or lines. The parser would need to identify these cases and not mistake them for regular text.\n\n5. **Non-Standard Inclusions**: There may be non-standard ways of including images, like embedding base64-encoded images or using org-mode macros that generate image links. These would be harder to parse without specific rules.\n\n6. **Hidden Images**: An image link might be commented out or inactive, meaning it should not be treated as an included image.\n\n7. **File Path Escaping**: File paths may include spaces or special characters that are escaped, which would require unescaping for proper display or usage of the file names.\n\n8. **Multiple Images in a Single Line**: There could be multiple images included in a single line, which would require careful parsing to extract each one.\n\n9. **ORG Markup**: The ORG file might contain additional markup surrounding image links that could complicate the extraction process.\n\n10. **Encoding and Character Sets**: The character encoding of the ORG file could affect how text is read and interpreted, potentially causing issues with correctly identifying image file names.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will help in creating a more robust parser for extracting image file names from an ORG file.
