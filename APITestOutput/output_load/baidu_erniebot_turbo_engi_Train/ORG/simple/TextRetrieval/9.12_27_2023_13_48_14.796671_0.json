Typically, bold text in ORG mode is denoted by surrounding the text with asterisks, like so: *bold text*. However, there can be variations or complexities that could pose challenges:\n\n1. Inline Formatting: Bold text might be embedded within other text or alongside other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks.\n\n2. Escaped Characters: Sometimes asterisks are used in a non-formatting context and are escaped (e.g., \\*not bold\\*), which should not be interpreted as bold.\n\n3. Multiline Bold Text: The bold text might span across multiple lines, which would require the parser to detect and handle multiline formatting correctly.\n\n4. Different Markup: The file might use a different markup convention for bold text than the standard ORG mode asterisks.\n\n5. Nested Formatting: Bold text could be nested inside other formatting or contain other formatted text within it, which makes parsing more complex.\n\nOnce we encounter the input file, we will need to look for the asterisk patterns that denote bold text, consider these potential difficulties, and extract the raw text accordingly. Please provide the ORG file content so that we can proceed with parsing and extracting the bold texts."
