Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Variations in Image Syntax**: ORG mode allows for multiple ways to include or link to images, such as using `file:` links or inline `[[file:image.jpg]]` links. The parser must handle all possible syntax variations.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be included using either relative or absolute paths. The parser must correctly identify and extract the filenames irrespective of the path type.\n\n3. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Sometimes images may be embedded directly using Base64 encoding. Detecting and extracting the image filename (if available) or handling the Base64 encoded data could be challenging.\n\n4. **Links with Descriptions**: Links in ORG files can include descriptions that could potentially contain file-like strings, which could confuse the parser if not handled properly.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Links**: The ORG file might contain commented-out sections or inactive links that include image filenames. The parser needs to differentiate between active and inactive content.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: The parser must recognize various image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and not confuse them with non-image files.\n\n7. **Multiple Images on a Single Line**: If multiple images are included on a single line, the parser must be able to extract each one separately.\n\n8. **Non-Standard Markup**: Users may use non-standard or custom markup to include images, which would require custom parsing logic.\n\nThe parser should be robust enough to handle these complexities and accurately extract only the filenames of the image files included in the ORG file content that will be provided."
