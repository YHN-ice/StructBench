In ORG files, images are typically linked using the syntax `[[file:image_name.extension]]`. The main potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the correct extraction of image file names are:\n\n1. **Variations in Linking Syntax**: The syntax for linking images might vary, including plain text links, markdown-style links, or special ORG mode directives.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: Images could be linked with relative or absolute paths, and these paths could be complex, involving directories and subdirectories.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML or LaTeX**: If the ORG file includes raw HTML or LaTeX code, image links within those blocks might follow different syntaxes which need to be recognized separately.\n\n4. **Comments and Archival Sections**: The ORG file might contain commented-out sections or archival sections where links are present but not meant to be treated as active content.\n\n5. **Link Description**: Org-mode allows for two-part links where the second part is a description. The parser must distinguish the actual link from its description.\n\n6. **Multiple Links on One Line**: There may be multiple image links on a single line, which should be parsed correctly to extract all image file names.\n\n7. **Non-Image File Links**: The file might contain links to non-image files that should not be extracted.\n\nIf you provide me with the content of an ORG file or further instructions on how to handle these situations, I can proceed to extract the image file names accordingly."
