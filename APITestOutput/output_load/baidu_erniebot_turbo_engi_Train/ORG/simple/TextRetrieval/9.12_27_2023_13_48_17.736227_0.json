In ORG files, text is typically made bold by surrounding it with asterisks, like this: *bold text*.

It's important to distinguish between these uses.\n   \n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may have nested formatting, such as links, code, or italic text within it, which might complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes asterisks are escaped within the text, which means they don't denote bold text but are rather literal characters.\n\n4. **Multiple Bold Sections**: A line may contain multiple bold sections, and each must be extracted separately.\n\n5. **Line Breaks**: Bold text could span multiple lines, and depending on how it is formatted, it may be challenging to extract it correctly.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might not always strictly follow the markup rules, leading to inconsistencies that make it difficult to parse the text accurately.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser needs to carefully analyze the ORG file syntax to ensure all and only the bold texts are extracted correctly."
