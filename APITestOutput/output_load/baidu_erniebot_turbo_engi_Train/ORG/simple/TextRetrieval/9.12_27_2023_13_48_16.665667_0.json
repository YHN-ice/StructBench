Typically, it is wrapped within asterisks, like `*bold text*`, but without seeing the file, it's challenging to know if there are variations or additional markup around bolded sections.\n\n2. **Line Breaks and Continuations**: Bold text might span multiple lines or be interrupted by line breaks. Handling these cases requires careful parsing to ensure the text is extracted correctly.\n\n3. **Embedded Formatting**: An ORG file may contain bold text nested within other formatting, like links, code blocks, or italicized text. Distinguishing standalone bold text from these instances can be tricky.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Special characters could be part of the bold text, which might affect the parsing logic if not handled correctly.\n\n5. **Consistency in Formatting**: Assuming consistency in the use of asterisks for bold formatting is a potential pitfall, as there might be non-standard uses of asterisks within the document.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: There may be escape characters in the ORG file that affect how the bold syntax is interpreted.\n\n7. **False Positives**: There might be asterisks used in the document for other purposes (like bullet points or emphasis) which are not meant to indicate bold text. Parsing logic needs to differentiate these from actual bold formatting.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, we need to parse the file with these potential issues in mind and develop a logic that can accurately identify and separate out bolded content according to the ORG file's syntax rules."
