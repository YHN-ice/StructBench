However, users could potentially use other symbols or mistakenly use similar-looking characters that do not conform to the standard syntax.\n\n2. **In-line code or examples**: Bold syntax within in-line code or example blocks should not be treated as bold text for the purpose of extraction.\n\n3. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italic or underlined text, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\n4. **False positives**: Asterisks are also used for bullet points and headings in ORG mode, so distinguishing between these uses and actual bold text is crucial.\n\n5. **Escaped characters**: Users might escape asterisks to prevent formatting (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which should not be treated as bold text.\n\n6. **Partial formatting**: Sometimes, formatting markers might be mismatched or incomplete (e.g., `*bold`), which can lead to confusion about what should be considered bold.\n\n7. **Line breaks and whitespace**: Handling line breaks and varying amounts of whitespace near bold markers can affect how text is extracted.\n\n8. **Encodings and character sets**: The file encoding might affect how characters are read and interpreted, especially if non-standard characters are used for formatting.\n\n9. **Comments and directives**: Org files can contain comments and directives that may include asterisks but aren't meant to format text as bold.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, careful parsing rules should be implemented to accurately identify and extract only the intended bold text from the ORG file content."
