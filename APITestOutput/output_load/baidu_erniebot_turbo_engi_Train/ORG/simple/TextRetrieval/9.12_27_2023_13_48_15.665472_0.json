It's commonly `*text*`, but there could be exceptions or additional whitespace that needs to be accounted for.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting options like italic, underline, etc. Parsing this correctly without losing information might be challenging.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: If the bold text contains special characters or asterisks within it, the parsing logic must be smart enough to distinguish these from the formatting markers.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used as regular characters might be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which should not be confused with bold formatting.\n\n5. **Inline Code or Verbatim Text**: Text within inline code or verbatim blocks (`~code~` or `=verbatim=`) should not be mistaken for formatting.\n\n6. **Links and Images**: Links and images may contain asterisks which are not indicative of bold text.\n\n7. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, which can complicate extraction if the parser expects it to be on a single line.\n\n8. **Mixed Content**: A line could contain both bold and non-bold content, and only the bold parts should be extracted.\n\nApproaching these challenges requires a robust parsing strategy that can handle the syntax and structure of ORG files accurately. If you provide an ORG file or a sample text, I can demonstrate how to extract the bold texts from it while considering these potential issues."
