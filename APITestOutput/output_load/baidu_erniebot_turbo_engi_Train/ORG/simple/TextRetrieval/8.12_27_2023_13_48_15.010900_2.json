We need to be familiar with the different syntaxes used to link images such as inline image links, attachment links, or links within descriptive text.\n\n2. **Text Ambiguity**: The ORG file could contain non-image links or text that resembles image links which do not actually point to a file. We will need to differentiate actual image links from similar-looking text.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image links can be either relative or absolute paths. We must be able to handle both types and recognize the file names in each case.\n\n4. **Multiple Links on the Same Line**: There can be multiple image links on the same line, so we'll need a way to extract each link correctly even when they are not separated by new lines.\n\n5. **Different File Formats**: Images can come in various formats (jpg, png, gif, etc.), and we need to account for all possible image file extensions.\n\n6. **Link Formatting**: Links could be formatted differently within the ORG file, such as wrapped in brackets, using org-mode link syntax, or just plain URLs. We have to parse each format correctly.\n\n7. **Comments and Inactive Links**: Some image links might be commented out or marked as inactive. Depending on the requirement, we may need to ignore these links.\n\n8. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Sometimes images might be embedded directly in the file using Base64 encoding rather than linked as separate files. We would need to identify these and decide whether to count them as included image files.\n\nGiven these challenges, a robust parsing strategy would likely involve regular expressions or a dedicated parser for the ORG markup language to accurately extract the file names of all included images."
