However, there might be variations or inconsistencies in the way bold text is formatted, such as extra spaces between asterisks and text (e.g., `* bold text *`) or mixed usage of asterisks and other formatting symbols.\n\n2. **Asterisks Used for Other Purposes**: In ORG mode, asterisks are also used to represent headings. Therefore, distinguishing between bold text and headings (which also use asterisks but followed by a space) can be challenging.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting, like italicized text, code blocks, or as part of a hyperlink description. Extracting just the bold part while ignoring the surrounding context could be tricky.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it's important to correctly identify and extract the entire bold passage.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: Special characters within the bold text may affect the parsing process, especially if they resemble formatting markers.\n\n6. **Escaped Formatting Characters**: Users might escape formatting characters (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which would mean the text is not actually bold despite the presence of asterisks.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a robust parsing strategy needs to be implemented to accurately extract only the bold texts from an ORG file."
