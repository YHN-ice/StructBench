The parser needs to handle all these syntaxes.\n\n2. **Hidden or Encoded Links:** Sometimes, image links may not be straightforward. They could be wrapped in other Org-mode constructs or encoded in some way (like base64).\n\n3. **File Path Variations:** Image paths could be absolute, relative, or even remote URLs. The parser must correctly identify and extract only the file names, irrespective of the path complexity.\n\n4. **Non-image File Links:** ORG files can contain links to various types of files, not just images. The parser has to discern image files from others by looking at the file extensions or other identifying properties.\n\n5. **Comments and Sections:** Images could be commented out or included within specific sections of the file. The parser needs to differentiate between actual image inclusions and those that are merely mentioned or commented out.\n\n6. **Embedded Images:** In some cases, images could be embedded directly into the ORG file with a data URI scheme; these aren't files per se, but still count as images.\n\n7. **Multiple Occurrences:** The same image file might be linked multiple times throughout the document. The parser has to decide whether to list duplicates or filter them out.\n\nOnce we have the input file in view, we can apply a strategy to parse it considering the above challenges."
