If not standardized, detecting bold might be challenging.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text could be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or struck-through text. It might be tricky to extract just the bold text without including other formatting.\n\n3. **Special Characters:** The bold texts may contain special characters that need to be handled correctly, such as asterisks that are part of the content rather than the formatting.\n\n4. **Text Across Lines:** Bold text may span multiple lines, and handling line breaks properly to extract the entire bolded content could be challenging.\n\n5. **Metadata and Directives:** ORG files can contain metadata (such as TODOs, tags) and directives that may not be relevant to the content. Ensuring that only content is extracted and not this metadata will be important.\n\n6. **Links and References:** Links or references within bold texts should be handled correctly—either included as part of the extracted text or removed based on the requirements.\n\n7. **Consistency of Extraction Rules:** It's essential to apply consistent rules across the entire document for what constitutes \"bold\" text to ensure all instances are caught.\n\nOnce I have the input file, I'll need to consider these potential issues in order to extract the bold texts accurately."
