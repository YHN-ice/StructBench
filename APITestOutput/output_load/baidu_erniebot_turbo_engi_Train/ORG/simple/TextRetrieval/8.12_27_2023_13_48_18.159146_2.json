The parser must handle all the syntax variations used for embedding images (e.g., links, attachments).\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: Images could be referenced by absolute or relative paths, and the parser must correctly identify and extract the file name in each case.\n\n3. **Link Formatting**: Image links in ORG files could have additional formatting or descriptions that need to be discerned from the actual file name.\n\n4. **Image Formats**: There are various image file formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF), and the parser should recognize all possible image extensions.\n\n5. **Multiple Inclusions**: An image could be included multiple times within the document. The parser might need to handle duplicates depending on the requirements.\n\n6. **Non-Image Links**: The parser must differentiate between image file links and other file types or URLs to avoid false positives.\n\n7. **Embedded Base64 Images**: If images are embedded directly into the ORG file in Base64 format, rather than linked by file name, it would be difficult to extract them as 'file names'.\n\n8. **In-line vs Block Images**: Images could be presented in-line with text or as standalone blocks, and parsing rules might need to account for these differences.\n\n9. **Comments and Annotations**: The ORG file might contain comments or annotations that include text resembling file names but aren't actual image files.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: Character encoding issues could arise if the ORG file contains non-standard characters in the file names.\n\nEach of these issues would require specific handling in the parser logic to ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
