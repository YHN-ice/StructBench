We need to recognize all possible formats for image links (e.g., local file links, URLs).\n\n2. **Variety of Image Extensions**: There may be various image file formats included such as .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. The parser needs to consider all common image file extensions.\n\n3. **Embedded Images vs External Links**: Images could be directly embedded in the ORG file, or there might be external links pointing to online resources. We need to distinguish between these and extract the filenames accordingly.\n\n4. **Inline Links vs Attachment Links**: Image links may be embedded inline within text or as standalone attachment links. The parser should be able to handle both cases.\n\n5. **Markup Variations**: The markup around the image link could vary and include additional attributes or descriptions, which may complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Non-Image File Links**: There might be other non-image file links present in the document which should be ignored.\n\nOnce we have the input ORG file content, we will parse it line by line and extract all the lines that contain references to image files, paying attention to these potential difficulties."
