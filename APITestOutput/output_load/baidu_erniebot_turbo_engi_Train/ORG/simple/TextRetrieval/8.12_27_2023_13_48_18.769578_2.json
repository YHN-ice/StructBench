Identifying Image Links: ORG files may contain links to images in various formats. The parser must correctly identify all the different ways images can be included, such as direct links, markdown-style links, or even embedded base64 images.\n\n2. Relative vs. Absolute Paths: Images may be included using relative or absolute paths. The parser must be able to handle both and distinguish between them if necessary.\n\n3. Different Markup Styles: ORG files can use different markup styles to include images. The parser must recognize each style used for image inclusion.\n\n4. Nested Structures: ORG files can contain nested structures like lists, tables, or code blocks. Images could be included within these structures, so the parser must traverse these correctly.\n\n5. File Extensions: The parser must identify image files based on their extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) and possibly handle cases with no extension but known MIME types.\n\n6. Handling Errors and Exceptions: The parser should gracefully handle any errors or exceptions that occur during the parsing process, such as broken links or inaccessible files.\n\n7. Performance Considerations: If the ORG file is large, the parser must be able to handle it efficiently without consuming excessive memory or processing time.\n\nTo start the parsing process, I would need to see the input ORG file content to apply the appropriate pattern matching or string processing methods to extract the image file names."
