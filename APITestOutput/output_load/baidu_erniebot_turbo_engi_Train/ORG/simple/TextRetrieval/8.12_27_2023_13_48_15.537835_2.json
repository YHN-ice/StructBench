We need to handle these variations correctly.\n3. **Link Description**: An image link could have a description that doesn't necessarily indicate the file type, e.g., `[[file:image.jpg][An image]]`. The parser must recognize and extract the actual file name.\n4. **Non-image Files**: There might be links to non-image files or other embedded content that should not be confused with image files.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser needs to:\n\n- Identify and handle different path representations.\n- Recognize and parse all valid ORG mode syntaxes for embedding images.\n- Distinguish between image links and other types of links or content.\n- Extract only the file names of images, ignoring descriptions or captions.\n\nOnce you provide the ORG file content, I will attempt to extract all included image files considering the above challenges."
