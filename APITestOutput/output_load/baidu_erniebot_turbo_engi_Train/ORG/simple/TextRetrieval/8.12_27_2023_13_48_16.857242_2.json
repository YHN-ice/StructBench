Images might be linked using the file protocol (e.g., `[[file:image.jpg]]`) or via URLs (e.g., `[[http://example.com/image.jpg]]`). The parser must be able to recognize all these formats.\n\n2. **Inline Images vs. Links:** ORG files can display images inline or as clickable links. The parser needs to distinguish between them if only embedded images are required.\n\n3. **Various File Formats:** There could be multiple image formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG) and the parser should be ready to identify all of them.\n\n4. **Complex Markup:** ORG files support rich text formatting, which might include complex markup surrounding image links that could make parsing difficult.\n\n5. **Attachments vs. Links:** Some ORG files may refer to images as attachments rather than direct links. The parser should be capable of identifying these references.\n\n6. **Multi-line Links:** Sometimes image links can be split across several lines, especially when using descriptive captions. The parser should be able to handle multi-line constructs.\n\n7. **Different Link Formats:** Apart from the standard link format, there are other formats like descriptive links (`[[file:image.jpg][Description]]`) that need to be parsed correctly to extract the image filename.\n\n8. **Comments and Code Blocks:** Images might be mentioned in comments or within code blocks, which might not be a part of the main text and should not be extracted as part of the image list.\n\n9. **Duplicate Images:** The same image might be included multiple times in the document. Deciding whether to list duplicates or only unique filenames is necessary.\n\nBy anticipating these issues, the parser can be designed to robustly extract all included image files from an ORG file accurately."
