Typically, bold text is denoted by surrounding the text with asterisks (e.g., `*bold text*`), but variations could exist.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks could be used in the text not to denote bold but as literal asterisks. I'll need to differentiate between actual bold syntax and escaped characters that are meant to be shown as asterisks.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italic, underlined, or code blocks. It is crucial to ensure that only the bold text is extracted and not any surrounding formatting.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it might be more challenging to extract it correctly without losing the intended structure or accidentally including non-bold text.\n\n5. **Incorrect Formatting**: Users might make mistakes in the formatting which could lead to incorrect parsing, such as missing an asterisk or uneven formatting.\n\n6. **Special Cases**: There could be special cases where the bold syntax is used in a context that doesn't actually mean the text is bold (e.g., in examples of how to use ORG mode).\n\n7. **Performance Concerns**: If the ORG file is very large, performance concerns might arise, necessitating more efficient parsing strategies.\n\nTo provide accurate responses, I'll need to properly handle these potential issues. Now, if you provide me with the ORG file content, I can attempt to extract the bold texts for you."
