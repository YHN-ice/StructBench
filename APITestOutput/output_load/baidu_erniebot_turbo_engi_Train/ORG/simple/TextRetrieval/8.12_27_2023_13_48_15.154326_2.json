Identifying these links and distinguishing them from other types of links (like hyperlinks to web pages) requires knowledge of the syntax used for images.\n\n3. **File Formats**: Images can come in various formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). Recognizing all possible image formats is necessary to ensure that no image file is missed.\n\n4. **Path Variations**: Images might be linked with absolute or relative paths and could be located in different directories or online. Handling these variations is important when extracting the file names.\n\n5. **Embedded Images**: If images are embedded in some way rather than linked, extracting their filenames would require different parsing techniques.\n\n6. **Markup Variations**: Users can sometimes use custom markup or shortcuts to include images which may not follow the standard formatting.\n\n7. **Link Text**: Sometimes the actual file name might be different from the link text shown in the ORG file, which could lead to confusion during extraction.\n\n8. **Repeated Images**: The same image might be included multiple times in the document. Deciding whether to list duplicates or filter them out could be a consideration.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I'll be able to apply the appropriate parsing technique to extract all included image files and list their names."
