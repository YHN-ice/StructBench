If the syntax used to include images is non-standard or varies within the document, it can be harder to identify and extract the image filenames.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: Image files might be included with absolute paths, relative paths, or as links. These variations need to be handled to correctly identify and extract the image filenames.\n\n3. **Embedded Images**: Sometimes images may be included as base64 encoded strings directly into the document, instead of referenced by filename. In such cases, there would be no actual 'filename' to extract.\n\n4. **Commented or Inactive Links**: Image links might be commented out or marked as inactive. Deciding whether to include these in the extraction could be challenging since they are not part of the rendered document.\n\n5. **Image-related Keywords**: The document may contain other keywords related to images (like #+ATTR_HTML: for specifying attributes), which are not image file names but are related to image configuration.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Determining which file extensions should be considered as 'image' files is necessary. Common image extensions include `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., but there are many more, and some might be specific to certain domains or use cases.\n\n7. **Large Documents**: If the ORG file is quite large with many links, it may be performance-intensive to parse the entire document for image links.\n\n8. **Markup within Links**: Sometimes links might have additional markup around them or within them which needs to be correctly interpreted to extract just the filename.\n\nThe most typical approach would involve searching for lines that contain links or references to image files and then extracting the parts of those lines that correspond to the filenames. This can be done using regular expressions or specific parsing rules that understand the structure of ORG mode documents."
