However, the exact syntax might vary, or additional characters may be included, making it harder to identify.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting tags, such as italic, underline, or strikethrough, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: If the ORG file contains escape characters that prevent asterisks from being interpreted as formatting characters, it might lead to false positives or negatives.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If a bold text spans multiple lines, it might be challenging to extract it correctly without proper parsing logic that can handle line breaks.\n\n5. **Links and Code Blocks**: Bold text within links or code blocks might follow different rules or be intended not to be formatted, so distinguishing these cases is necessary.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: There could be cases where the bold formatting is started but not properly ended, which would require a decision on how to handle these instances.\n\nTo ensure accurate extraction of bold texts, the parser will need to robustly handle these cases and any other formatting intricacies present in ORG files."
