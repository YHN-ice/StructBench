Recognizing all possible inclusion patterns is crucial.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be included with relative or absolute paths. The parser must extract the filenames regardless of how they are referenced.\n\n3. **Embedded Images**: Images might be embedded directly in the file in base64 or similar encoding. These would not have traditional filenames and might be harder to extract.\n\n4. **Link Variations**: ORG files often include links that could be to images but might not be formatted as standard image file inclusions (e.g., links to a webpage that displays an image).\n\n5. **Comments and Non-Standard Usage**: Sometimes, the inclusion syntax might be commented out or used in a non-standard way, which means the parser needs to distinguish between actual inclusions and other uses of what might look like inclusion syntax.\n\n6. **File Format and Encoding Issues**: The ORG file might use a character encoding that's not expected, or it might not be well-formed, which could complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Multiple Inclusions in One Line**: There might be lines that include multiple images, and the parser will need to separate them correctly.\n\n8. **Non-Image File Extensions**: The parser should filter out non-image files if there are links or inclusions that aren't images but might resemble image file paths.\n\nOnce I have the input ORG file content, I will look for lines that include patterns typically used for image inclusions (such as `[[file:imagename.ext]]`) and extract the filenames from these lines."
