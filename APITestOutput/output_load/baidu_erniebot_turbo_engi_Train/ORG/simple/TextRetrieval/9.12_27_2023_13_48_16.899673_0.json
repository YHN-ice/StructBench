ORG files are plain text files with special syntax for tasks, notes, and planning. Bold text in ORG is typically marked with asterisks, like this: *bold text*. However, depending on the conventions used in the ORG file, there might be different ways to encounter obstacles:\n\n1. **Multiple Formats for Bold**: The ORG file may use different syntaxes for bold text, such as wrapping with `/` or `_` instead of `*`, or it might use markup that's specific to a particular system or application.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting Conflicts**: Bold text could be inside other formatting, like links or code blocks, which may alter how the bold syntax is interpreted.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks might be used for other purposes in an ORG file, such as for list items or headings. This could lead to mistaking non-bold text for bold text if not parsed correctly.\n\n4. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other bold text or within other types of formatting, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used to denote bold text might be escaped in some cases (like \\*not bold\\*), and handling these would require additional logic to distinguish them from actual bold markers.\n\n6. **Cross-line Bold Text**: If the bold text is spread across multiple lines, it may not be immediately obvious how to extract it correctly without additional context or parsing rules.\n\n7. **Special Cases**: The document may contain special cases where the syntax is used in a non-standard way that may require custom parsing logic.\n\nOnce we identify these potential difficulties, we should be ready to parse the file accurately by paying attention to context and being mindful of the conventions used within the file.
