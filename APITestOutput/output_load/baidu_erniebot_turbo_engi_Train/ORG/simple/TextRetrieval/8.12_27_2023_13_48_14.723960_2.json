Image File Extensions: There are many image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.). The parser should be able to recognize all common image file types.\n\n3. Inline Images and Attachments: ORG mode supports inline images, so there may be specific syntax to denote this that I should be aware of.\n\n4. Multi-line Links: If the ORG file contains links that span across multiple lines or include additional descriptions or annotations, this could complicate the parsing process.\n\n5. Comments or Inactive Links: Images might be referenced in comments or as inactive links, which may or may not be considered as 'included' depending on the context required.\n\n6. Encoded or Embedded Images: Images might be base64 encoded or embedded directly within the file in some way, which would require decoding.\n\n7. False Positives: Text that looks like an image file link but isn't intended as one might lead to incorrect extraction.\n\nKnowing these potential obstacles, I'd need to see the actual ORG content to determine the correct approach to extract the image filenames accurately."
