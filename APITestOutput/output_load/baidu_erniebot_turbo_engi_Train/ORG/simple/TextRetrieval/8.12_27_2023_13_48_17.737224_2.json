We need to know the specific syntax used for including images.\n\n2. **Path Complexity**: The path to an image can be absolute, relative, or even linked via a URL. We must handle all these cases correctly.\n\n3. **File Extension Diversity**: There could be various image formats included such as .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. We should be ready to recognize all common image formats.\n\n4. **Embedded vs. Linked Images**: Some images might be directly embedded into the ORG file (though this is less common), while others are merely linked. We should focus on linked images as embedded images would not have a filename.\n\n5. **Textual Noise**: Since ORG files can contain a lot of textual data that is not related to image files, we need a robust way to distinguish image file references from other content.\n\n6. **Markup Syntax**: We need to understand the markup syntax that indicates an image reference. For example, it might be within square brackets or follow a specific keyword.\n\nOnce we have the ORG file input, we can look for patterns that match image file inclusions and extract the relevant filenames while handling the above obstacles."
