Distinguishing between these uses might be challenging.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts:** If bold texts span across multiple lines, it could be more difficult to detect and extract them correctly compared to single-line bold texts.\n\n5. **Escape Characters:** There may be escape characters in the ORG file that prevent asterisks from being interpreted as markup for bold text.\n\n6. **Special Cases:** There could be special cases where the bold syntax is part of a larger structure like tables, headlines, or blocks, which might require context-specific parsing logic.\n\nOnce the file is available, these challenges will need to be accounted for to accurately extract all bold texts."
