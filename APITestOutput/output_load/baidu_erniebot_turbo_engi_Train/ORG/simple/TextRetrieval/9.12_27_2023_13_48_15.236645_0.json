Different Formatting: ORG files can have various ways to denote bold text, such as surrounding the text with asterisks (*) or using specific markup tags. Identifying all the potential formatting rules for bold text is necessary.\n\n2. Nested Formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. Proper parsing would need to handle such cases without getting confused by the nested formats.\n\n3. Partial Bold Text: Some parts of a line might be in bold, while others are not. The parser must distinguish and extract only the bold parts.\n\n4. Inline Code or Links: Bold text might contain inline code snippets or links. The parser must decide whether to include or exclude such elements when extracting the bold text.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: Asterisks used for other purposes (like lists or as literal asterisks) might be escaped or used in a context that doesn't indicate bold text. The parser should correctly interpret these cases.\n\n6. Inconsistencies and Errors: The ORG file could contain inconsistencies or errors in formatting, which could confuse the parser if it's expecting strict adherence to formatting rules.\n\nNow, let's proceed with parsing the ORG file provided. Please input the ORG file content so that I can extract all bold texts for you."
