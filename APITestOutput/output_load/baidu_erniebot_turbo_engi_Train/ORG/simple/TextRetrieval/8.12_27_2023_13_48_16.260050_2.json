This would require decoding the Base64 data to identify and extract the image information.\n\n7. **Comments and Inactive Links**: Images might be included in comments or as inactive links, which should typically not be treated as 'included' images for extraction purposes.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, a robust parsing strategy is needed that can handle various inclusion methods, resolve paths correctly, and ignore non-relevant image links."
