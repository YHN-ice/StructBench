We need to be familiar with all possible variations.\n2. Inline vs. Block Images: Images can be included inline with text or as a separate block. The parser must handle both cases.\n3. Paths and URLs: Images can be linked through relative paths, absolute paths, or URLs. The parser should be able to differentiate between these and extract the correct file name or URL.\n4.
