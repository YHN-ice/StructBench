However, the number of asterisks and spacing might cause issues. For example, `**not bold**` with spaces could be a heading rather than bold text.\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold text may be part of a sentence or paragraph, which can make it harder to extract without pulling in additional unwanted text.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links, code blocks, or italic text, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used for other purposes might be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), and thus should not be interpreted as bold formatting.\n\n5. **Special ORG Constructs**: ORG files can contain special constructs like drawers, blocks, or tables that may use asterisks in a different context.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users may not consistently follow the markup rules, which can lead to false positives or negatives during parsing.\n\n7. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If a bold text spans multiple lines, it might be tricky to extract it correctly without missing parts of the text or including extra content.\n\n8. **File Encoding/Character Set**: The file might use a character set that doesn't render correctly in all environments, affecting the ability to parse it correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing strategy would need to be implemented that can accurately identify the start and end of each bold section while managing the context in which these bold markers are found."
