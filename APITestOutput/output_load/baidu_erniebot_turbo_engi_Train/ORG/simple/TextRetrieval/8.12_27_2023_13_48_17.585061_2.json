However, there are several potential difficulties and obstacles that might complicate the process:\n\n1. **Variety in Embedding Syntax:** ORG files may use different syntaxes to embed images. For example, some might use a direct link, while others might use a more complex structure or even macros that reference images.\n\n2. **Image References vs. Actual Files:** The ORG file might reference images that are located on the web or within a particular directory that isn't included in the ORG file itself. Determining which images are actually included and which are merely linked could be challenging.\n\n3. **Textual References to Images:** The ORG file might have textual references to image filenames that are not actual embeddings (like in a list of files) which should not be mistaken as included images.\n\n4. **Formatting and Comments:** Sometimes image links may be part of commented lines or blocks, which should typically be ignored when extracting image files.\n\n5. **Image Files in Different Directories:** If the ORG file contains paths to image files, those paths could be absolute or relative, and handling each type requires a different approach.\n\n6. **File Extension Variations:** Image files can have multiple extensions (e.g., .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif), and the parser needs to account for all possible variations.\n\n7. **Encoded or Embedded Images:** Some images could be base64 encoded or embedded in a different way within the ORG file, which would require decoding before the filenames can be extracted.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will parse its contents while keeping an eye out for these potential complications to accurately extract all included image file names."
