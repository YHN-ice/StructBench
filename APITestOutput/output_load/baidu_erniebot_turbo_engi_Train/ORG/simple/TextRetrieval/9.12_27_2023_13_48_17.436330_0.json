Handling the nested cases without losing the bold formatting information might be tricky.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks or other bold markers might be used in the text for purposes other than bold formatting (e.g., to denote a list item), which could lead to incorrect extractions if not accounted for properly.\n\n4. **Partial Formatting**: Some bold markers might not properly close, leading to partial formatting which needs to be correctly identified and handled.\n\n5. **Ambiguous Cases**: There could be ambiguous cases where it's not clear whether the text is meant to be bold or not, especially if there are errors in the formatting.\n\n6. **Large Files and Performance**: If the ORG file is very large, performance could become an issue, and strategies for efficient text processing might be needed.\n\n7. **Encoding and Special Characters**: The file might contain special characters or use an encoding that needs to be correctly interpreted to extract the text accurately.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll apply the necessary logic to parse out the bold texts according to the format specified in the input."
