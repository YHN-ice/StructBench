Extracting filenames will be different in each case.\n\n3. **Variety of image formats:** There could be multiple image formats used within an ORG file (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and the parser must recognize all of them.\n\n4. **Complex file paths:** Image file paths can be complex or even relative. They may require normalization to extract just the file name.\n\n5. **Markup complexity:** ORG files allow for rich markup, which can include nested structures that might complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Link text vs file names:** Sometimes, the displayed text for a link is not the same as the actual file name, and parsing should differentiate between the two.\n\n7. **Comments or non-image links:** The ORG file might contain comments or links that aren't images. The parser should not confuse these with image file names.\n\n8. **Large files and performance:** If the ORG file is very large with many images, ensuring timely and efficient parsing could be challenging.\n\n9. **Incorrect or broken links:** Some image links might be incorrect or point to non-existent files, leading to confusion in the output if not handled properly.\n\n10. **Encoding issues:** Character encoding issues may arise, especially if the ORG file contains non-ASCII characters in image filenames.\n\nUnderstanding these potential difficulties will help to tailor the parsing approach to ensure accurate extraction of image file names from an ORG file. Now, please provide the input ORG file content for analysis and extraction."
