For example, images can be linked with a simple file path or wrapped within additional markup for captions or other attributes. We must handle all these variations correctly.\n\n2. **Path complexity**: Image paths can be absolute, relative, or embedded with different directory structures. Extracting the file names accurately requires correctly parsing these paths.\n\n3. **Inline images vs. attachments**: Images can be included inline within the text or attached as separate resources. Identifying which part of the text refers to an image can be tricky.\n\n4. **File extensions**: Differentiating between image files and other types of files (e.g., documents, archives) means recognizing various image file extensions (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.).\n\n5. **Linked vs. actual filenames**: Some ORG files may link to images hosted online rather than stored locally, which could require different handling.\n\n6. **Formatting errors**: Typos or formatting errors in the ORG file might lead to incorrectly formatted image links that could be missed or misinterpreted by a parser.\n\n7. **Text that looks like file names**: Sometimes text within an ORG file might coincidentally look like a file name but isn't intended to be a link to an image; a parser will need to differentiate between the two.\n\n8. **Encoding and special characters**: File paths may include spaces, international characters, or special characters that need to be handled correctly.\n\nBefore parsing the file, it's important to understand the specific syntax and conventions used in the ORG file provided to ensure accurate extraction of image file names."
