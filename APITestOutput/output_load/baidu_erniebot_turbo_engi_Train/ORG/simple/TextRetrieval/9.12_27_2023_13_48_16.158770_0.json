Nested or combined markup might complicate the extraction of solely bold text.\n\n3. **Special Characters:** Bold text might include special characters or escape sequences that need to be handled correctly.\n\n4. **Variety of Bold Syntaxes:** In ORG mode, bold text can be denoted in different ways (e.g., with asterisks like `*bold*` or with different markup). Ensuring that all methods are accounted for is necessary.\n\n5. **Contextual Interpretation:** Certain asterisk patterns might not actually indicate bold text but rather list items or sections. Understanding the context is important to avoid false positives.\n\n6. **Large Files and Performance:** If the ORG file is very large, parsing it efficiently without running into performance issues can be challenging.\n\n7. **Embedded Content:** The file might contain links, images, or embedded content where the asterisks aren't meant to denote bold text but are part of URLs or syntax.\n\n8. **Non-text Content:** If the ORG file contains non-text content like tables or code blocks, it may affect the parsing logic for bold text.\n\nTo proceed effectively, it will be important to have a clear definition of how bold text is represented in the ORG format being parsed and have a robust method for identifying and extracting it correctly."
