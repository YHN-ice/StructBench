Identifying Image Links: An ORG file may contain links to images embedded within text or source blocks. The parser must correctly identify the syntax used to link images.\n\n2. Recognizing File Formats: The parser needs to recognize various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif) amidst other non-image content.\n\n3. Handling Relative and Absolute Paths: Image links can be either relative or absolute paths, and the parser should handle both types correctly.\n\n4. Filtering Out Non-Image Links: An ORG file may contain links to other types of files or URLs that are not images. The parser should filter these out.\n\n5. Dealing with Org Mode Syntax: Org mode has its own markup syntax for linking files, which may differ from HTML or Markdown. The parser should be familiar with this syntax.\n\n6. Handling Multi-Line Links: Sometimes, links can be broken up over multiple lines, especially if they are long. The parser will need to join these lines to extract the full path of the image file.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll be able to apply a method to extract the image file names according to the specific syntax and structure used in that ORG file."
