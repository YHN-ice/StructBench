Each type requires a different method to extract the filename.\n\n3. **Link Variations**: Image file links may have variations, such as absolute paths, relative paths, or URLs. Identifying and extracting only the filenames from these paths can be challenging.\n\n4. **Non-image Links**: The ORG file may contain links to non-image files, which should not be confused with image files. A filter based on file extension or content type may be needed.\n\n5. **Hidden or Commented Out Links**: Sometimes, image links can be commented out or hidden within the ORG file's text. Deciding whether to include these in the output could be a consideration.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, it will be necessary to define clear patterns that identify image links and to use those patterns to reliably extract only the filenames of the images."
