However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume you can provide the content of the ORG file as text, and then I'll demonstrate how one might parse it.\n\nORG files are plain text files used by Emacs' Org-mode and use a simple markup language for outlines, notes, and to-do lists. Bold text in Org-mode is typically denoted by surrounding the text with asterisks, like this: *bold text*.\n\nPotential difficulties and obstacles in parsing such a file might include:\n\n1. **Ambiguity in Markup**: Sometimes the asterisks might be used for other purposes (like bullet points or italic text, which uses just one asterisk), or there could be nested formatting (e.g., bold text within italicized text), which would complicate the parsing.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the file doesn't consistently use formatting conventions (for example, if sometimes bold text is indicated with underscores instead of asterisks), it makes it harder to extract accurately.\n\n3. **Complex Structure**: ORG files can contain a lot of structure, like headings, lists, links, and more. If bold text appears within different structural elements, it may require a more complex parsing strategy to identify all instances.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes characters that would otherwise indicate formatting (like asterisks) are escaped to be included as literals in the text (e.g., \\*not bold\\*). Parsing needs to account for these escape characters.\n\n5. **Text Encoding**: If the file uses a non-standard text encoding or contains special characters, it may affect the way the text is read and interpreted.\n\nOnce you provide the input from the ORG file, I can demonstrate how to extract bold text assuming that it follows the standard Org-mode convention of using double asterisks for bold formatting."
