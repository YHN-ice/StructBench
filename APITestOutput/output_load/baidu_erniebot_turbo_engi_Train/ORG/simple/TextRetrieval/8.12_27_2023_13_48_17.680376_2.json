I'll need to recognize all the possible ways images can be embedded or linked.\n2. **Variety of Image File Types**: There could be a variety of image file types included in the ORG file (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif). I need to be prepared to handle different extensions.\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images might be linked using absolute paths, relative paths, or even URLs. It's necessary to distinguish these and extract just the file names if that's what's required.\n4. **Hidden or Commented Out Images**: Images might be included in sections that are commented out or in some way marked as not to be displayed. Depending on the requirement, these may or may not be considered.\n5. **File Path with Spaces**: File paths or names with spaces can complicate parsing, as spaces might be used as delimiters in the ORG format.\n6. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Sometimes images are embedded directly in the file as Base64 encoded strings. These wouldn't have traditional file names but could still be considered images included in the document.\n7. **Text that Looks Like Image Links**: Sometimes, text might look like an image link but isn't (e.g., example text or a code snippet). I need to differentiate actual image links from other text.\n\nOnce I see the input ORG file, I can apply appropriate parsing techniques to extract the image files while considering these potential challenges."
