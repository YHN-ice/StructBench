It could be a local file path, an HTTP URL, or even a reference to a file attachment. The parser needs to handle these different kinds of link formats.\n\n3. **Image References Within Markup**: If the image references are within markup or structured blocks (like lists or tables), the parser must be able to navigate through the syntax to find the image references.\n\n4. **Incomplete or Broken Image Links**: There might be cases where the image links are incomplete, broken, or incorrectly formatted, which could make it difficult to accurately extract the image file names.\n\n5. **Embedded Base64 Image Data**: Sometimes, images might be embedded directly in ORG files with Base64 encoded data rather than linked as separate files. The parser should differentiate and ignore these if only file names are required.\n\n6. **Syntax Variations**: ORG mode allows for different syntax variations for including images, such as using brackets or not, which might complicate the parsing logic.\n\n7. **Comments and Non-image Links**: There might be other links or commented lines that are not images. These should not be extracted by the parser.\n\n8. **Escaped Characters**: Special characters in file names or paths might be escaped.\n\n9. **File Path Complexity**: Some images might be stored in complex directory structures with relative or absolute paths that need to be resolved correctly.\n\nThese obstacles would require a robust parsing algorithm capable of handling various cases to accurately extract all image file names from an ORG file."
