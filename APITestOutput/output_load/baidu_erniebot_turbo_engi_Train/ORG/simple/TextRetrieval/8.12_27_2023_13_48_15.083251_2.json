This requires the parser to handle multiple patterns for image inclusion.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: The image file paths could be relative or absolute, and they might include spaces or special characters that need to be correctly interpreted.\n\n3. **Image Formats**: Images can be in various formats (e.g., jpg, png, gif), and the parser must be able to recognize all the possible image file extensions.\n\n4. **Embedded vs. Linked Images**: Some images may be embedded in the document in encoded formats (like base64), while others might be just linked. It's important to differentiate between these cases.\n\n5. **False Positives**: There could be non-image links or text that looks similar to image file names which might lead to false positives if the parser isn't careful.\n\n6. **Markup Confusion**: The ORG mode markup for images might be close to other markup for different functionalities, requiring precise pattern matching to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Incomplete or Broken Links**: Some image links might be incomplete or refer to missing files, which could result in incorrect extraction unless handled properly.\n\n8. **ORG Mode Specific Features**: ORG mode has its specific features like links that can have descriptions, and it could affect how images are parsed.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser needs to be well-designed to recognize and handle various inclusion methods, paths, and file extensions, as well as account for ORG-specific syntax and potential anomalies in the text."
