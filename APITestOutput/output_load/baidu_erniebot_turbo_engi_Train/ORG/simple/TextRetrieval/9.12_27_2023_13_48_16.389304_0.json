The standard syntax is usually surrounding the text with asterisks, like `*bold text*`, but variations could exist.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italic, underlined, or strikethrough, which could complicate the extraction.\n\n3. **Special Characters:** The presence of special characters or escape sequences within or around the bold markers could affect the correct identification of bold text.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Texts:** If bold texts span multiple lines, it may require a multiline parsing approach which can be more complex than single-line parsing.\n\n5. **False Positives:** Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as for bullet points or as part of code blocks. Distinguishing between these uses and actual bold text is necessary to avoid false positives.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Use of Markup:** Users might not consistently use markup which can result in incomplete or malformed bold syntax that still needs to be recognized.\n\n7. **Embedded Code or Links:** Bold text might contain links, code snippets, or other embedded content that could require special handling during extraction.\n\nIt's important to address these challenges while developing a robust method to extract all bold texts from an ORG file accurately."
