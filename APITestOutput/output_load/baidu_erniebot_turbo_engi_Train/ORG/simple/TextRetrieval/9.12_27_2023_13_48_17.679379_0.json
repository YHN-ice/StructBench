Identifying Bold Syntax: ORG files use specific syntax to denote bold text, which is typically surrounding the text with asterisks, like *this*. However, it can vary if the user has customized the markup or if there are nested formatting options.\n\n2. Nested Formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links, code blocks, or italicized text. Parsing that correctly to only extract the bold text might be challenging.\n\n3. Incomplete or Broken Markup: There might be instances where the bold markup is incomplete (e.g., a missing asterisk), which could make it harder to identify bold text.\n\n4. Inline Code or Verbatim Text: Bold markup inside inline code or verbatim text should not be treated as bold formatting. Distinguishing these cases can be complex.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: Asterisks used as literal characters rather than formatting must be identified and handled correctly (e.g., '\\*' should not be interpreted as bold).\n\n6. Variations in Formatting: Different users might use variations of the bold syntax, including different numbers of asterisks or other characters that might be mistaken for formatting markers.\n\n7. Multiline Bold Text: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser will need to correctly identify and handle line breaks within the bold sections.\n\nIf you provide me with the ORG file content, I can proceed to extract the bold texts while considering these potential challenges."
