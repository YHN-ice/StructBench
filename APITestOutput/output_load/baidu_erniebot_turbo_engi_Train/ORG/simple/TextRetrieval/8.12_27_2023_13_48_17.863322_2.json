Ensuring that the parser recognizes all valid syntax variations for image links is important.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be linked with relative or absolute paths. The parser must handle both types correctly.\n\n3. **File Type Recognition**: Only image files should be extracted, which means the parser must correctly identify image file extensions amidst other types of files.\n\n4. **Embedded vs. Linked Images**: Images might be embedded directly into the ORG file in base64 or other formats, or just linked from external sources. The parser should discern and extract the filenames of linked images.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Some parts of the ORG file might be commented out or otherwise marked as inactive. The parser must ignore these sections.\n\n6. **Multiple Links on a Single Line**: If there are multiple image links on a single line, the parser should correctly separate and extract each filename.\n\n7. **Non-standard Markups or Org-Mode Extensions**: If the ORG file uses non-standard markups or extensions to link images, it might be challenging to recognize and extract them without tailored parsing logic.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: The parser should gracefully handle errors or malformed links without crashing or giving incorrect output.\n\nPlease provide the ORG file content so I can attempt to extract the image filenames."
