Images could be linked inline, as attachments, or even embedded in a different manner. The parser must handle all these scenarios.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths:** Image files could be referenced via absolute paths, relative paths, or even URLs. The parser has to correctly identify these to extract only the file names.\n\n3. **Hidden or Commented Links:** Images inside commented sections or code blocks should not be considered as included images. The parser needs to distinguish between actual content and non-relevant sections.\n\n4. **File Name Extraction:** Once a link is identified, the challenge is to accurately extract the file name, which might require parsing out directories or URL parameters.\n\n5. **Alternative Text:** Image links in ORG files may contain alternative text descriptions which need to be ignored when extracting file names.\n\n6. **Complex Markup:** ORG files support rich text and can contain complex markup. It's important for the parser to not get confused by non-image links or other embedded objects.\n\n7. **File Name Variations:** There could be variations in the image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif), and the parser must recognize all possible image formats.\n\nUnderstanding how ORG syntax represents images and writing a robust extractor that can handle these potential challenges will be key to accurately retrieving all image file names from the file."
