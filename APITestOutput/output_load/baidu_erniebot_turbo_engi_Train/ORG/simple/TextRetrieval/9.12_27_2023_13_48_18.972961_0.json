In ORG mode, text is typically made bold by surrounding it with asterisks, like so: *bold text*. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might not always follow the exact syntax required for bold formatting (e.g., extra spaces around asterisks or missing asterisks), which could lead to missed occurrences of bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks, making it more challenging to extract only the bold text.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: The text might contain special characters or escape sequences that need to be handled correctly to avoid parsing errors.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If a bold section spans multiple lines, the parser needs to correctly identify and extract the entire section without terminating at the line break.\n\n5. **False Positives**: Asterisks could also be used for other purposes such as bullet points or as literal asterisks in the text, leading to false positives if not handled properly.\n\n6. **File Size and Complexity**: Large files with complex structuring might slow down the parsing process or make it more error-prone.\n\n7. **Embedded Source Code or External Links**: ORG files may contain source code blocks or external links that can include asterisks, potentially complicating the parsing.\n\nThe parser must be robust enough to handle these diverse scenarios and accurately extract only the intended bold text from the document."
