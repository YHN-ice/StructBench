The parser must recognize all such syntax variants.\n\n2. **Path Specifications**: Images might be included with absolute or relative paths, and the parser will need to handle these correctly.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: The parser must identify all possible image file extensions (like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.)\n\n4. **Embedded vs. Linked Images**: Some images might be embedded directly into the ORG file in base64 or another format, while others are linked. The parser needs to differentiate between these.\n\n5. **Markup Complexity**: ORG files can contain complex markup, including nested structures. Images might be within these structures, and the parser has to navigate them properly.\n\n6. **Non-Image Links**: The ORG file could contain links to non-image files or URLs, and the parser has to ignore these.\n\n7. **Comments and Archives**: Images might be referenced in commented-out sections or archived sections, and depending on the requirements, the parser may need to ignore or include these.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will look for lines that specifically reference image files and extract the filenames, considering the potential difficulties mentioned above."
