Typically, it is surrounded by asterisks (e.g., *bold text*). I need to correctly identify this pattern.\n\n2. Variations in Markup: Users might use different numbers of asterisks or other characters for bold formatting, depending on personal preference or mistakes. This could make pattern recognition more difficult.\n\n3. Nested Formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting elements (like lists, headers, or italic text), which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. Inline Formatting: Bold text might not always be isolated on its own line; it could be part of a larger line of text, requiring more sophisticated parsing to extract just the bold parts.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: Users might escape asterisks to use them literally in the text instead of for bold formatting (e.g., \\*not bold\\*), which should not be extracted as bold.\n\n6. Inconsistent Formatting: The ORG file might have inconsistencies in formatting due to user error, which may require heuristic approaches to extract bold texts reliably.\n\n7. Multiline Bold Texts: If a bold text spans multiple lines, it can be tricky to parse and extract it correctly while maintaining the context and content structure.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, I will need clear rules or patterns to identify the bold text and consider the context in which formatting appears. Now, please provide the ORG file content so I can start the extraction process."
