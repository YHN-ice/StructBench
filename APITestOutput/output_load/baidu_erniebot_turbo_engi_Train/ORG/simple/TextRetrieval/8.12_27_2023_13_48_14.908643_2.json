The parser must differentiate between these and possibly normalize the paths if required.\n\n3. **Embedded Images vs Linked Images:** An ORG file might have images that are embedded directly in the file (as base64, for example), or linked from external sources. The parser needs to distinguish between these types.\n\n4. **File Formats:** There are numerous image file formats, and the parser should be able to recognize the common ones (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.) as well as less common ones if they are used in the ORG file.\n\n5. **Markup Confusion:** ORG files can contain a lot of markup for different elements (like TODO items, headlines, etc.). It's possible that some of this markup could be confused with image links if not parsed correctly.\n\n6. **Multi-line Links:** Sometimes links might be broken over multiple lines for formatting reasons. The parser would need to correctly concatenate these lines to extract the full link.\n\n7. **Comments and Inactive Links:** The ORG file might contain commented-out links or inactive links that should not be considered as included images.\n\nThe parser will have to handle all of these potential issues to correctly extract all included image filenames."
