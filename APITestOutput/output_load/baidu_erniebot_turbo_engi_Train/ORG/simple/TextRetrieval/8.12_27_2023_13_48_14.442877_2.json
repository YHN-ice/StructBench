For example, images might be linked using the `[[file:path/to/image.jpg]]` syntax or embedded using the `#+CAPTION: Caption here\\n[[file:image.png]]` pattern. Identifying all possible ways images can be included in an ORG file is necessary to extract all image filenames correctly.\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: The file paths for the images could be relative to the location of the ORG file or absolute paths. This may require different handling to determine the actual path of the image file.\n\n3. **Hidden or Commented Images**: Images that are commented out or included in a non-standard way may not be intended for extraction. We must decide if we want to include those or if we should only consider images that are actually displayed in the document.\n\n4. **Non-standard File Extensions**: While common image file extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc., are easy to recognize, there might be images with non-standard or less common file extensions that could be missed if we're not careful.\n\n5. **Linked URLs**: Some images might not be file paths but URLs to images hosted online. Deciding whether these should be included as \"image files\" is another consideration.\n\n6. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Occasionally, images might be embedded directly in the ORG file as Base64 encoded strings. Identifying and handling these cases can be quite complex.\n\n7. **Multiline Links**: If an image link is broken up across multiple lines due to formatting or line wrapping, it might make regex matching or simple string searching unreliable.\n\n8. **Special Characters and Spaces in Filenames**: Filenames with spaces or special characters might require special handling, especially if they are not consistently formatted throughout the document.\n\n9. **Caching and File Existence**: If the task involves verifying the existence of these files, caching results for performance and checking if the files exist on the system could be additional considerations.\n\n10. **File Versioning and Duplicates**: Sometimes, files might have version numbers or duplicates with slightly different names (e.g., `image_v1.jpg`, `image_v2.jpg`). Deciding how to handle these cases could affect the output.\n\nTo provide a precise answer, we need to see the input OR"
