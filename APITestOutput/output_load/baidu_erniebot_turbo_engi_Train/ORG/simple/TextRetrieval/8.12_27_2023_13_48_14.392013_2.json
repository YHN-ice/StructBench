Commonly, images are included as links, but there could be variations in how these links are formatted.\n\n2. **File Path Formats**: Images can be included with absolute or relative paths, and they might be within different directory structures. The parser needs to recognize various path formats.\n\n3. **Link Identification**: Not all links in an ORG file point to images. I need to differentiate between image file links and other types of links.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: There are various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser must recognize all possible image file extensions.\n\n5. **Embedded Images**: Images might be embedded directly into the document in base64 or other formats rather than linked as separate files, which could complicate extraction.\n\n6. **Markup Variability**: ORG mode allows for customization and may include user-defined markup that could obscure or alter the standard way of including images.\n\n7. **Non-standard Inclusions**: Users might include images in a non-standard way that does not follow typical ORG mode conventions, such as embedding images within source blocks or other constructs.\n\nTo properly extract all image filenames, I would have to handle all these potential issues effectively.
