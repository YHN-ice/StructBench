Identifying the correct syntax for bold text: ORG files use specific markup for styling text. Bold text is usually indicated by asterisks (*) or by other means depending on the conventions used in the file.\n\n2. Handling nested formatting: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italic, underlined, or code blocks. It's important to correctly parse the bold text without including the surrounding formatting.\n\n3. Dealing with variations in markup: Different users or systems might use slightly different markup styles for bold text, such as using one asterisk instead of two or including spaces between the asterisks and the text.\n\n4. Interpreting escape characters: There may be escape characters or sequences that prevent certain asterisks from being interpreted as bold markup, which should be correctly identified and handled.\n\n5. Managing multiline bold text: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it could present additional complexity in correctly identifying and extracting the entire section of bold text.\n\n6. Extracting only the raw text: After identifying the bold text, it's necessary to extract just the raw text without any of the markup symbols.\n\n7. Ensuring robustness: The parser must be robust enough to handle various edge cases and inconsistencies that might appear in a real-world ORG file.\n\nOnce we have the input ORG file, we will need to apply the necessary logic to overcome these challenges and accurately extract all bold texts."
