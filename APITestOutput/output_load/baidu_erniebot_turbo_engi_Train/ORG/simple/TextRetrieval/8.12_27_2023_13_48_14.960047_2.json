Images can be included with different syntaxes, so identifying all possible formats is necessary.\n\n2. **Inline Images vs. Attachments**: Images in ORG files can be included inline within the text or as attachments. The parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n3. **File Path Complexity**: Image paths can be absolute, relative, or even URLs. The parser should correctly identify the file name in each case without including path components or URL parameters.\n\n4. **Non-image Links**: Besides images, ORG files can contain links to other types of files or web pages. The parser must distinguish image files from other link types.\n\n5. **Markup Variability**: The way images are included might be affected by surrounding markup, such as being within lists, tables, or other structures. The parser needs to recognize image links regardless of context.\n\n6. **Embedded Base64 Images**: If images are embedded in the document using base64 encoding, extracting the file names might not be straightforward since they don't have typical file names and are not linked as separate files.\n\n7. **Comments or Non-rendered Text**: Some links may be commented out or within sections that are not rendered, and depending on the requirement, you might need to decide whether to include or exclude these.\n\n8. **Textual Representation**: If the ORG file is provided as plain text, ensuring that the text is correctly interpreted by the parser and that line breaks or other formatting do not interfere with link detection is crucial.\n\nOnce we have the actual ORG file content, we can determine which of these potential issues apply and address them accordingly to extract the image file names."
