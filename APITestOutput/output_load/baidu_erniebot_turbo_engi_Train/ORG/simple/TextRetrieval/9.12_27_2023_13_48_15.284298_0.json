The most common syntax is wrapping text with asterisks, like `*bold*`. However, variations or errors in formatting may occur.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might also contain other formatting, such as links, italic text, or code snippets. We need to ensure that we only extract the bold text itself, without any nested formatting.\n\n3. **False Positives**: Asterisks are also used for other purposes in ORG files, such as for list items or headings. We have to distinguish between these uses and actual bold formatting.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold text might span multiple lines. Parsing should correctly handle these cases without breaking the text into separate lines if they are meant to be together.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Use of Spaces**: Users might inconsistently use spaces around the asterisks, which could complicate the identification of bold text.\n\n6. **Escape Characters**: Asterisks used as literals might be escaped with a backslash, which would mean they shouldn't be interpreted as formatting characters.\n\nTo address these challenges, we would ideally use a parser that understands ORG file syntax, or we would write a custom parser that can handle these specific cases based on a clearly defined set of rules for what constitutes bold text in the context of an ORG file."
