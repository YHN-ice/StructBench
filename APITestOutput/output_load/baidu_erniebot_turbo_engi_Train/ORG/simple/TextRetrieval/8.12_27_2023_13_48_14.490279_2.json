Different syntax for including images: ORG files can include images using various markup formats. I will need to know all the possible formats to correctly identify the image file links.\n\n2. Relative vs. absolute paths: Images might be included using relative or absolute paths. I need to handle both cases and extract just the file names if that's what is required.\n\n3. Variations in image file extensions: There are multiple image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, .svg). The parser must recognize all possible image extensions.\n\n4. Inline images vs. linked images: Images can be embedded directly into the ORG file or linked from external sources. The parser needs to differentiate between these two cases.\n\n5. Image references within other markup: Sometimes an image file name might be part of a larger block of markup or within a complex line of text. It is important to parse such lines correctly to extract the image file name.\n\n6. Handling duplicate image names: If there are multiple references to the same image file, we need to decide whether to list duplicates or filter them out.\n\n7. Comments and inactive links: The ORG file could contain commented-out lines or inactive links that shouldn't be considered when extracting image file names.\n\nOnce I have access to the input ORG file, I can apply the appropriate parsing techniques to extract the image file names while addressing these potential issues."
