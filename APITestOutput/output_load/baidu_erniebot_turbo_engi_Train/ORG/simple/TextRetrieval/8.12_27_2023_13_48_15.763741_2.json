For example, images can be linked with markup like `[[file:image.jpg]]`, or they may be included as part of markdown like `![alt text](image.jpg)`. We need to account for all possible syntax variations.\n\n2. **Path Complexity:** Image paths can be simple filenames (e.g., `image.jpg`), or they can include directories and subdirectories (e.g., `./images/image.jpg`). We need a method that can extract the filename irrespective of the path's complexity.\n\n3. **File Extensions:** There are multiple image file formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`). The parser needs to recognize all common image file extensions.\n\n4. **False Positives:** There might be non-image links or other text patterns that resemble image file syntax but are actually not images. It's crucial to distinguish actual image links from false positives.\n\n5. **Embedded Images vs. Linked Images:** In some cases, images might be embedded in base64 encoding or linked externally via URLs. We need to decide whether to consider these as included image files.\n\n6. **Rich Content:** ORG files can contain various rich content besides images, like tables, code blocks, etc. We need to ensure that our parser does not misinterpret non-image content as images.\n\n7. **Comments and Annotations:** Sometimes, image links might be commented out or annotated in a way that they should not be considered part of the document's active content. The parser should be able to ignore such cases.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will help in designing a robust parsing strategy that extracts image file names accurately from the ORG file provided."
