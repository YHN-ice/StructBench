This could be complicated by non-standard or double extensions (e.g., \"image.jpg.backup\").\n\n6. **Embedded images**: If the ORG file contains base64 encoded images or any kind of blob data, it might be necessary to extract and save this data as a separate file to view it.\n\n7. **File existence verification**: Just because an image path is mentioned doesn't guarantee the image file actually exists at that path; verification might be required.\n\n8. **Textual content that looks like links**: Sometimes text content may coincidentally look like a link (e.g., if someone wrote \"example.png\" in a sentence), but it isn't actually intended to be an image link.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll be able to apply the relevant parsing rules to extract only the image files.
