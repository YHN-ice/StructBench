Ensuring we can handle all possible syntax variations is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italic or underlined sections. It's important to correctly identify and extract only the bold parts.\n\n3. **Multiple Bold Sections**: An ORG file might contain multiple bold sections close together or separated by other content. We need to extract each one without losing any in the process.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, asterisks or other formatting characters are escaped to be displayed literally, so we need to distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n5. **Links and Code Blocks**: ORG files can include links or code blocks that may contain asterisks or similar characters that aren't meant to format text. We must avoid extracting these as bold text.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be cases where the formatting is incomplete or incorrect (e.g., missing a closing asterisk). Deciding whether to include these as bold text can be challenging.\n\n7. **Special Org-Mode Constructs**: Org-mode has special constructs such as headlines, lists, or blocks that might influence how we interpret the bold syntax.\n\n8. **Large Files and Performance**: If the ORG file is particularly large, the parsing process might be slow, and performance optimizations could be necessary.\n\n9. **Character Encoding**: The file's character encoding might affect how we read and interpret the text for parsing.\n\nOnce the input file is available, these challenges will be considered while extracting the bold texts."
