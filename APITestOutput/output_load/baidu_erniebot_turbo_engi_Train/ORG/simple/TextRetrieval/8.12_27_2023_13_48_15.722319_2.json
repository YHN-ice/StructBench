For example, images might be linked with plain links or embedded using specific markup for images.\n\n2. **File Path Variability**: The paths to image files could vary widely, including absolute paths, relative paths, or URLs. This requires the parser to handle all these variations correctly.\n\n3. **Multiple Image Formats**: Images can be in various formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF), so the parser has to recognize all possible image file extensions.\n\n4. **In-line Text**: ORG files can contain text and other elements in-line with image links. The parser must be able to distinguish image file names from surrounding text.\n\n5. **Comments and Other Markup**: Images could be within comments or other markup, which should not be treated as part of the document content. The parser has to understand and possibly ignore such markup when extracting image file names.\n\n6. **Linked vs Embedded Images**: Some images may just be linked (not meant to be displayed within the document) while others are embedded (meant to be displayed). The parser must understand the intention based on the context.\n\n7. **Non-standard File Names**: File names might include spaces or special characters, which can make parsing tricky if not handled correctly.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the ORG file uses a non-standard encoding, it could cause issues in correctly interpreting the content of the file.\n\nThe parser would need to be robust and flexible enough to handle these potential issues to extract image file names accurately."
