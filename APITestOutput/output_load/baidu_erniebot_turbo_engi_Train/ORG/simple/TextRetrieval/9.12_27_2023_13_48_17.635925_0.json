Parsing nested markup accurately to extract only the bold text is important.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Sometimes bold markers might be escaped within the text, meaning they are not intended to format the text but to be displayed as literal characters. The parser should distinguish between formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Markup:** Users might not consistently apply markup, for instance, by forgetting to close the bold formatting, which could lead to parsing errors.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Text:** Bold text might span across multiple lines, and it's essential to capture the entire content without losing any information across line breaks.\n\n6. **File Encoding:** The file encoding might affect how text is read and interpreted.
