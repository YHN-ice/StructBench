You need to ensure that only the bold formatting is being extracted.\n3. **Special Characters**: Bold text could contain special characters or markup that needs to be handled or escaped correctly.\n4. **Incomplete Formatting**: There might be instances where the bold syntax is not properly closed, leading to ambiguity in what text is considered bold.\n5. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text may span across multiple lines, and you'll need to capture the entire content.\n6. **Variants of Bold Markers**: There might be variations in how bold is marked-up depending on the ORG file version or user customizations.\n7. **Contextual Relevance**: The bold text might be part of a larger context like a heading or a list, which might be relevant for understanding its meaning.\n8. **Link Descriptions**: If links contain descriptions, they might have bold parts that should be extracted separately from the link itself.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I would apply the necessary pattern matching to capture the bold segments while handling these potential issues."
