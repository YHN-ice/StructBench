Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Variation in Syntax**: Org mode uses asterisks to denote bold text. Typically, a word or phrase surrounded by pairs of asterisks (e.g., `**bold text**`) is rendered as bold. However, variations or incorrect use of asterisks could lead to difficulty in identifying bold text correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or struck-through text. Parsing the correct part as bold while respecting the nesting can be tricky.\n\n3. **Line Breaks**: If bold text contains line breaks or spans across multiple lines, it might be difficult to extract it as a continuous piece of text.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Special characters or escape sequences within the bold text might complicate the parsing process.\n\n5. **Non-standard Extensions**: Users can sometimes extend or modify the Org mode syntax with their configurations, which might introduce non-standard ways of denoting bold text.\n\n6. **Software Version Differences**: Different versions of Org mode might have slightly different syntax rules, which could affect the parsing logic.\n\nTo extract all bold texts, the parser would need to read through the content line by line and look for patterns that match the bold syntax, taking care to handle the above difficulties appropriately. Once identified, the bold text can be extracted and printed as per the requirement."
