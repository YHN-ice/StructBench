The syntax for these could vary, making it necessary to account for multiple patterns.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: Images could be linked with relative or absolute paths, and these paths could include directories, special characters, or spaces that need to be handled correctly.\n\n3. **File Format Assumptions**: If we assume only certain image file formats (e.g., jpg, png), we might miss other valid image formats included in the document (e.g., gif, svg).\n\n4. **Non-Image Links**: There might be other links present in the ORG file that are not image files. Differentiating between image links and other types of links can be challenging without a clear identifier.\n\n5. **Embedded Images**: If images are embedded in some way that does not use a standard file path or link, it might be difficult to identify and extract them.\n\n6. **Comments or Inactive Lines**: Image links might be part of comments or lines that are inactive and not meant to be parsed, which could lead to extracting image names that aren't actually used in the document.\n\nOnce you provide the content of the ORG file, I will look for lines that typically indicate image inclusion, such as those starting with `[[file:...]]` or `#+ATTACH:`, and extract the filenames from those lines. Please share the ORG file content so that I can assist you accurately."
