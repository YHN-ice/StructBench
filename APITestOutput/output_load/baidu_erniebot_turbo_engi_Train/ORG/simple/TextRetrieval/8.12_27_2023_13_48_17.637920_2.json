We need to recognize all possible formats to ensure that no image link is missed.\n\n2. **Embedded images vs linked images**: Images can be either embedded directly within the file or linked from external sources. We need to determine which of these are being used and extract the relevant information accordingly.\n\n3. **Image references without explicit file extensions**: Some images may be included without a clear file extension, relying on context or aliases, making it harder to identify them as image files.\n\n4. **Comments and inactive links**: ORG files can contain comments or inactive links. Images mentioned in these parts should typically not be counted as included images.\n\n5. **Markup syntax**: Org-mode has its own markup syntax. Understanding this syntax is necessary to correctly parse image links.\n\n6. **File path nuances**: Image paths can be absolute, relative, or use special variables or shortcuts defined within the Org-mode environment. These need to be interpreted correctly to extract just the file names.\n\n7. **Non-image file links**: The file may contain links to other types of files or URLs, which should not be confused with image files.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we must carefully identify and extract only those links that actually refer to image files. Now, please provide the ORG file content so that I can proceed with parsing it and extracting the image file names."
