Identifying which of these are image files will require recognizing the file extension or the context in which the link appears.\n\n2. **Different Link Formats**: The image files could be linked using different formats, such as local file paths or URLs. Handling each format correctly to extract the image filename will be necessary.\n\n3. **Inline Images vs. Attachments**: Images can be included inline within the text or as attachments. The parser will need to distinguish between these cases.\n\n4. **Syntax Variations**: ORG mode has flexible syntax. For example, links to images might be encapsulated by double square brackets or presented differently within the text. The parser must account for these variations.\n\n5. **Textual Ambiguity**: Regular text might contain periods and sequences of characters that resemble file paths or URLs but are not actual links to images.\n\n6. **Encoded or Obscured URLs**: If the image URLs are encoded (such as percent-encoding for URLs) or obscured in some way, additional decoding steps may be required to get the correct filenames.\n\n7. **Subfolders and Relative Paths**: Image files might be stored in subfolders or referenced by relative paths, and the parser should be able to handle these correctly.\n\nOnce the input ORG file is provided, these potential issues will guide us in implementing an effective strategy to extract all included image file names."
