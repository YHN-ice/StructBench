It is necessary to know the exact syntax used for bold text in the given file.\n2. **Nested Markup**: Bold text might be nested within other markup elements, making it harder to isolate without parsing the entire structure.\n3. **Escape Characters**: There might be escape characters that prevent certain text from being parsed as bold, which should be correctly identified and handled.\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it can be difficult to extract it correctly without context from the entire file.\n5. **Incorrect Formatting**: Users sometimes make formatting errors that could lead to ambiguous or incorrect parsing of what is intended to be bold text.\n\nTo address these challenges, one would typically need to:\n- Understand and accurately identify the markup syntax for bold text.\n- Parse the document structure to correctly handle nested markups.\n- Handle escape characters and other exceptions in the formatting.\n- Ensure that multi-line text is correctly identified and extracted as a single bold entry if intended.\n- Deal with any ambiguities or formatting errors in a sensible way, potentially by making assumptions or following a strict interpretation of the markup rules.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we can apply these considerations to extract the bold texts accurately."
