However, if the input file uses a non-standard way of denoting bold text, it may be difficult to correctly identify it.\n\n2. **Asterisks Used for Other Purposes**: Asterisks might be used in the ORG file for purposes other than making text bold, such as for bullet points in lists or for indicating emphasis with multiple asterisks aside from bold (e.g., `**bold**` versus `*italic*`). The parser must distinguish between these cases.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as links or code blocks, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Text**: If the bold text is split across multiple lines, it could be challenging to extract it as a single continuous piece of text.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might inadvertently use inconsistent formatting, such as missing an end asterisk or using different numbers of asterisks, which can lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: There may be escaped characters that affect how the text should be parsed (e.g., `*\\*not bold\\**`).\n\n7. **Special Characters**: The presence of special characters or unicode in the bold text may require careful handling to ensure correct extraction.\n\nThese challenges will need to be considered when implementing the parsing logic to ensure accurate extraction of bold texts from the ORG file."
