However, the syntax could vary depending on the ORG mode version or user customization (such as using `**bold**` or a different markup).\n\n2. **Inline Formatting**: Bold text might be mixed with other formatting within a single line, such as italics, underlines, or code blocks, which could complicate the parsing.\n\n3. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, it might be difficult to detect the end of the bold section if it's not properly closed with the corresponding asterisks.\n\n4. **Embedded Asterisks**: There might be asterisks within non-bold text that could be confused with the bold markup. For instance, asterisks used for bullet points or within code snippets should not be mistaken as bold formatting.\n\n5. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks used for bold formatting could be escaped within the text (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), which should not be recognized as bold.\n\n6. **Contextual Interpretation**: Some lines might contain asterisks that are not meant to signify bold text but rather indicate list items or other structural elements of the document.\n\nTo overcome these issues, careful parsing rules must be implemented to differentiate between actual bold formatting and other uses of asterisks. Regular expressions may be employed, but they should be designed to handle the above complexities. A context-aware parser would be ideal to deal with potential ambiguities."
