Handling relative paths might require additional context that isn't present in the file itself.\n\n3. **Embedded images**: Images might be embedded in the document, not as links, but as base64 encoded data or similar, which would be considerably more complex to extract.\n\n4. **External links**: Some images might be linked externally with URLs, which technically aren't \"included\" as files within the ORG document.\n\n5. **Non-image file links**: The document could contain links to non-image files that should not be extracted as part of the image file list.\n\n6. **Commented or inactive links**: There could be commented-out links or inactive links that should not be considered when extracting active image links.\n\nTo provide an accurate list of image file names, the parser will need to:\n\n- Correctly identify all the image link patterns.\n- Distinguish between image and non-image file links.\n- Ignore commented or inactive links.\n- Handle both relative and absolute paths appropriately.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file, I can review its contents and apply the necessary parsing logic to extract the image file names accordingly."
