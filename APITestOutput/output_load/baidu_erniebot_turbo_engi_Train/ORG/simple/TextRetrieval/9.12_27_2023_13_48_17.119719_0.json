Recognizing and accurately identifying this pattern is crucial.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting like italics, underlining, or code blocks. Handling such cases requires careful parsing to isolate the bold text without including other formatting elements.\n\n3. **Multiline Bold Text**: If bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must be able to recognize that the bold formatting continues across lines.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: There could be cases where asterisks are used in the text but not meant to denote bold formatting, such as in code snippets or when they're escaped. The parser needs to distinguish between actual formatting and literal asterisks.\n\n5. **Consistency in Formatting**: Variations in formatting (like spaces between asterisks and text) may exist which could affect the parser's ability to recognize bold text consistently.\n\n6. **Complex Documents**: An ORG file may have links, footnotes, lists, tables, etc., which might complicate the extraction process if they are intermixed with bold formatting.\n\nOnce we get the input file, these potential issues will guide us on what to look out for when extracting bold texts."
