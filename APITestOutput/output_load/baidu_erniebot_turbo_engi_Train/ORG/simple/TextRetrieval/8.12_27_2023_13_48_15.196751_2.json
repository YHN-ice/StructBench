For example, `[[file:myimage.png]]` or `#+CAPTION: This is an image\\n[[file:myimage.png]]`.\n\n3. **File Path Complexity**: File paths could be simple (`file:myimage.png`) or complex and nested (`file:./images/myimage.png` or `file:/absolute/path/to/myimage.png`), which can add complexity to the regex or parsing logic necessary to extract just the file name.\n\n4. **Embedded Content**: Images might not be directly included as files but rather embedded as Base64 or other encoded content, which would not have a standard file name to extract.\n\n5. **False Positives**: There may be non-image file links or content that resembles image file links but isn't (e.g., incorrect extensions, commented-out lines).\n\n6. **Attachments and Exports**: ORG mode allows for attachments that are not necessarily included in the text as direct links, and handling these would require understanding the attachment system of ORG mode.\n\n7. **Inconsistent Naming**: Filenames might include spaces, special characters, or international characters that need to be handled correctly.\n\n8. **Multi-Line Links**: An image link could be broken up across multiple lines, especially if the ORG file was formatted with a line width limit.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges is crucial for creating a robust solution to parse an ORG file and accurately extract the names of included image files."
