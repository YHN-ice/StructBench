Ensuring that the parser recognizes all the ways images can be referenced is crucial.\n\n2. **Paths and URLs:** Image files might be referenced via relative or absolute paths, or even URLs. The parser must handle all these cases correctly.\n\n3. **Embedded Images:** Sometimes, images might be embedded directly in the file (e.g., as base64 encoded strings). Distinguishing between embedded images and image file references is necessary.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Links:** Images could be referenced in commented-out sections or as inactive links. Depending on the requirements, the parser might need to ignore these.\n\n5. **File Extensions:** The parser must correctly identify all common image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and possibly uncommon ones as well.\n\n6. **Formatting Variations:** There may be variations in how image links are formatted, such as additional attributes or parameters that need to be ignored.\n\n7. **Link Titles and Captions:** Image links might include titles, captions, or descriptions that are not part of the image file name.\n\nNow that we've identified potential difficulties, please provide the ORG file content so I can start parsing and extract the image file names for you."
