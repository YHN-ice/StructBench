ORG files use a markup language similar to Markdown, used by Emacs Org-mode, and typically, bold texts are enclosed in asterisks. Some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the extraction process include:\n\n1. **Syntax variations**: Bold text in ORG files is typically surrounded by asterisks (e.g., `*bold*`), but we need to be careful with edge cases, like if asterisks are used in other contexts (e.g., for bullet points or italic text denoted by `/italic/`).\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text can potentially contain other formatting elements, like links or inline code, which we need to handle properly.\n\n3. **Escape characters**: If asterisks are used in the text not for bold formatting but as characters themselves, they might be escaped (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`), and we'll have to distinguish between actual formatting and escaped characters.\n\n4. **Multiple bold sections on the same line**: There might be multiple instances of bold text on the same line, each of which would need to be extracted separately.\n\n5. **Partial formatting errors**: The ORG file could contain errors in formatting where the bold syntax is not correctly closed (e.g., `*bold`), which we may need to decide how to handle.\n\n6. **Line breaks within bold text**: Bold text could span across multiple lines, which may require multiline parsing logic.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll need to account for these potential issues to accurately extract all bold text segments."
