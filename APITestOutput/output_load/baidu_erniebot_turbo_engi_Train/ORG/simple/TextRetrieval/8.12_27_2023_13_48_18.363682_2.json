Here are some potential difficulties that might arise during the process:\n\n1. **Variety of image file formats**: The ORG file could include various image formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, etc. The parser needs to recognize all possible image file extensions.\n\n2. **Image reference styles**: Images can be referenced in different ways within the text. They might be linked with a full URL, a relative path, or an absolute path. The parser must handle all such reference styles.\n\n3. **Syntax consistency**: ORG files use specific syntax to include images (i.e., links enclosed in double square brackets). The parser must correctly identify this syntax even if there are variations or typos made by the user.\n\n4. **Embedded images**: Some ORG files might have base64 encoded images embedded directly in the text. Extracting filenames for these would not be possible since they are not referenced by a filename but rather included as data.\n\n5. **Non-image files**: There could be other types of files linked in the ORG file. The parser should distinguish between image and non-image files.\n\n6. **Comments and inactive links**: The ORG file might contain commented-out lines or inactive links that should not be considered when extracting image filenames.\n\n7. **Text that looks like an image link**: Sometimes, text might accidentally be formatted in a way that resembles an image link but isn't one (e.g., a typo like [[myimage.png]] where the user didn't mean to create a link). This could trick the parser into extracting a non-existent image file name.\n\nOnce I have the content of the ORG file, I would look for patterns that match image links and extract just the filenames, taking into consideration the potential difficulties listed above."
