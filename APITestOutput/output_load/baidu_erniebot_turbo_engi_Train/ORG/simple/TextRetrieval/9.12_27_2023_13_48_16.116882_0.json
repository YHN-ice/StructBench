We need to differentiate between bold syntax and other uses of asterisks.\n\n4. **Escape Characters**: Bold text might include escape characters to include literal asterisks or other formatting characters, so the parser must correctly interpret these.\n\n5. **Multiline Bold Texts**: If bold text spans multiple lines, it needs to be captured in its entirety.\n\n6. **Links and Tags**: Links, tags, or other elements may be embedded within bold text, which might require additional parsing logic to extract cleanly.\n\n7. **Textual Content vs. Structure**: We want to extract the textual content without any structural markers that are part of the ORG file format.\n\nBy considering these potential issues, we can create a more robust parsing strategy to accurately extract bold texts from the ORG file. Now please provide the ORG file content so I can proceed with the extraction."
