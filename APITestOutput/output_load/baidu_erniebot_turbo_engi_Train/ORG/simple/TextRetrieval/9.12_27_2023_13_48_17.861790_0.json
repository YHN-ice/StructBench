For instance, text can be made bold by wrapping it with asterisks like `*bold*`. If the parser is not aware of all the possible syntax variations, it might miss some bold texts.\n\n2. **Escaping Characters**: Asterisks used in the text but not meant to indicate boldness could be escaped or used in a context that does not denote bold formatting. For example, `*not bold\\*` or `asterisks are used here for *other* purposes`. The parser must be able to discern when asterisks are used for bold formatting and when they are not.\n\n3. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, such as italic, underlined, or code blocks. This might complicate parsing because the bold syntax might be interrupted by other formatting markers.\n\n4. **Multi-line Bold Text**: Sometimes, bold text might span multiple lines, and if the parser assumes a single-line syntax for bold text, it will fail to recognize multi-line bold text.\n\n5. **Incorrect Formatting**: If the ORG file has incorrectly formatted bold text (e.g., missing an asterisk at the end), the parser needs to decide whether to be strict in syntax adherence or to attempt to recover from such errors.\n\n6. **Special Cases**: There might be special cases where bold syntax is used in a way that's not standard, such as in tables or source code blocks, where the usual parsing rules might not apply.\n\nTo ensure accurate extraction, the parser should be designed to handle all these potential issues appropriately."
