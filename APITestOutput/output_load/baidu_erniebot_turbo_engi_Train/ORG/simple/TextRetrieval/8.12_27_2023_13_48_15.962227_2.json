Different syntax might be used depending on the user's preferences or the version of the software used to create the document.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: Image file paths could be absolute or relative. If they are relative, understanding the base path will be necessary to resolve the file locations correctly.\n\n3. **Embedded vs. Linked Images**: Images might not be actually included in the ORG file but linked from external sources. Extracting such images could require additional steps like downloading them from the web.\n\n4. **File Name Ambiguity**: It's possible that file names could include special characters or spaces that need to be correctly identified and handled.\n\n5. **Markup Confusion**: ORG files can contain a lot of markup for different purposes. It's essential to distinguish between markup used for images and other elements like code blocks or tables to avoid false positives.\n\n6. **Image Formats**: There could be a variety of image formats (jpeg, png, gif, etc.), and the parser should recognize all the image extensions that are relevant.\n\n7. **Hidden or Commented Out Images**: Some image links might be commented out or placed within sections that are not exported in a final document. Determining whether to include these might be necessary based on the requirements.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the ORG file format and the conventions used for linking or embedding images within it. Additionally, implementing thorough regex patterns or using a dedicated ORG file parsing library could help accurately identify and extract image filenames from the document."
