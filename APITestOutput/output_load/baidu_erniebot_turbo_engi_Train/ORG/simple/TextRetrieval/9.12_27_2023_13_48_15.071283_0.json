Ensuring that all variations are accounted for might be a challenge.\n\n2. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting, like italic or underlined text, which could make parsing more complex.\n\n3. **Line Breaks**: Bold text that spans multiple lines or paragraphs may require careful handling to ensure that the entire bold section is captured without breaking at line ends.\n\n4. **False Positives**: Asterisks could be used for other purposes, such as bullet points or emphasis, and determining the intent might not always be straightforward without context.\n\n5. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes asterisks are escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting, which means not all asterisks signify bold text.\n\n6. **Incomplete Formatting**: If the formatting is not correctly closed (e.g., a missing asterisk at the end), it could throw off the parser.\n\n7. **Embedded Code or Links**: ORG files can contain links, source code, or other embedded items that might use asterisks or similar characters, potentially leading to confusion when extracting bold text.\n\n8. **Comments or Metadata**: The file might contain comments or metadata that use asterisks in a way that is not intended to represent bold text.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be designed with a robust understanding of the ORG file format and its syntax rules. It must also handle edge cases and ambiguities with a clear set of assumptions or fallback rules. Now, please provide the input ORG file content so I can attempt to extract the bold texts."
