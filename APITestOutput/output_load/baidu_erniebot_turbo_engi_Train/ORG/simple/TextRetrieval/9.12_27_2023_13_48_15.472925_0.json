Recognizing the pattern that defines bold text is crucial.\n\n2. **Dealing with nested formatting**: There could be nested formatting within the bold text, such as italicized words or code snippets. This may make it challenging to extract just the bold text without including other formatting.\n\n3. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines. Handling line breaks properly to ensure the entire bold text is extracted is necessary.\n\n4. **Special cases**: Sometimes, asterisks could be used in a different context, such as in lists or as multiplication symbols in equations. Differentiating between these uses and the actual bold formatting is important.\n\n5. **Partial formatting**: There may be instances where only part of a word or sentence is bolded, which needs careful attention to extract accurately.\n\n6. **Consistency in formatting**: Inconsistencies in the way bold text is formatted in the document (such as using different numbers of asterisks) could complicate the extraction process.\n\nIf you provide me with an ORG file or its contents, I can demonstrate how to overcome these challenges and extract the raw bold texts for you."
