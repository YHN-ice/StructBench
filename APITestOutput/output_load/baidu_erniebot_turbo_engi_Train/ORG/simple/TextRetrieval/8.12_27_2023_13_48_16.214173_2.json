The syntax for embedding images can vary, and there might be direct links, links with descriptions, or embedded HTML tags for images.\n\n2. **Inline and Block Images**: Images can be included inline within text or as standalone blocks. An effective parser must handle both cases.\n\n3. **File Path Variations**: Image file paths can be absolute, relative, or even URLs. The parser needs to correctly identify and extract just the file name from these paths.\n\n4. **Multiple Images on a Line**: There might be multiple images on a single line, and the parser should be able to identify each one separately.\n\n5. **Non-Image Links**: The document could contain links to non-image files or external URLs that should not be confused with image files.\n\n6. **Comments and Archive Sections**: Images might be within commented sections or archive sections which might or might not be intended for extraction.\n\n7. **Different File Extensions**: Image files can have various extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and the parser should recognize all common image formats.\n\n8. **Metadata or Attributes**: Some images might be included with additional metadata or attributes (like width, height, etc.) that need to be ignored when extracting the file name.\n\nTo correctly extract all image file names, the parser should be robust against these potential issues.
