It is necessary to correctly identify and process this markup to extract the bold text.\n\n2. **Handling nested formatting**: Bold text within ORG files might also contain other formatting, such as italicized text, underlined text, or links. Nested formatting must be handled properly to ensure only the bold text is extracted.\n\n3. **Dealing with variations in markup**: Users may not always adhere strictly to the syntax rules—for example, there might be spaces between the asterisks and the text, or inconsistent use of asterisks—which could make pattern matching for bold text more challenging.\n\n4. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text in ORG files can span multiple lines. A parser must be able to handle and recognize when the bold formatting starts and ends, even if it goes across line breaks.\n\n5. **Escape characters**: In some cases, asterisks might be used in the text not to denote bold formatting but as literal characters. The parser needs to recognize escape characters or patterns that indicate the asterisks should not be interpreted as formatting.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll be able to apply the appropriate parsing logic to extract all the bold texts, taking into consideration these potential challenges."
