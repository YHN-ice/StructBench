This can complicate the parsing logic as we would need to handle multiple levels of formatting.\n\n3. **Incomplete Markers**: There might be instances where the bold markers are not correctly paired (e.g., missing an asterisk at the beginning or end of the text), which could lead to incorrect or incomplete extraction.\n\n4. **Escaped Characters**: Asterisks that are meant to be literal rather than formatting (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`) should not be treated as bold markers.\n\n5. **Special ORG Mode Syntax**: Org mode has its own syntax for various constructs (e.g., headers, lists, blocks) that might contain bold text in a different context, so it's important to differentiate these constructs from plain bold text.\n\n6. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which adds complexity to the parsing as we would need to keep track of line breaks and continuity of formatting markers.\n\nAddressing these issues requires careful handling of the ORG file content and robust parsing logic to ensure that all bold texts are extracted accurately."
