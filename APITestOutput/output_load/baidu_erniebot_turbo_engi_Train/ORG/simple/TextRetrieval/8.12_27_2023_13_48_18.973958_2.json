Inline links, attachment links, or even encoded images could be present, each requiring a different parsing approach.\n\n2. **Syntax Variations**: The syntax for embedding images could vary, including different brackets or formatting for hyperlinks that could point to image files.\n\n3. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Image paths could be relative or absolute, and may include URLs or filesystem paths. This could affect how we identify and extract the filenames.\n\n4. **Textual Similarity**: There may be non-image links or other text within the file that resembles image file formats, leading to false positives.\n\n5. **Hidden or Masked Filenames**: Filenames could be masked behind a hyperlink description, requiring deeper parsing to extract the actual filename.\n\n6. **Markup within the File**: The ORG file may contain markup or other metadata that is not related to images but could interfere with simple string matching.\n\n7. **File Accessibility**: If the ORG file contains links to images hosted online, it might be necessary to distinguish between accessible and broken links, which isn't possible without actually trying to access the images.\n\n8. **Encoding**: Special characters in filenames might be encoded in some way (e.g., spaces as `%20`), and decoding may be necessary to get the correct filename.\n\nOnce the input ORG file content is provided, I would look for lines containing image file patterns (usually ending with typical image extensions like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and then extract and list those filenames."
