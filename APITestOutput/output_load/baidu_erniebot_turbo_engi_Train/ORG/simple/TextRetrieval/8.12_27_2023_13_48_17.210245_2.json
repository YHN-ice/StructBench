We need to identify all possible ways images can be linked or embedded within the file.\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images could be referenced using absolute or relative paths, and we need to account for both when extracting the file names.\n3. **File Formats**: There are various image file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), and we need to ensure that we recognize and extract all of them.\n4. **Inline Images vs. Attachments**: Images can be included inline within the text or as attachments. We need to distinguish between actual image files and other types of links or attachments.\n5. **Parsing Errors**: If the file contains syntax errors or non-standard formatting, it may complicate the parsing process.\n6. **Large Files and Performance**: If the ORG file is large with many images, performance might be a concern. Efficient parsing will be necessary to handle large datasets without affecting performance significantly.\n\nOnce we start parsing the input file, we'll need to carefully handle these potential issues to successfully extract all image file names."
