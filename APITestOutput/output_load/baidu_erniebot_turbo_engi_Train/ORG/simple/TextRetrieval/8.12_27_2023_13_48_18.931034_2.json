In ORG mode (a mode for Emacs), images might be embedded using links. Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Variations in Link Formats**: The link format for embedding images might vary. We need to identify all possible formats (e.g., with or without captions, different protocols, inline display options).\n\n2. **Relative vs. Absolute Paths**: Images can be included with either relative or absolute paths. We have to account for both types when extracting the filenames.\n\n3. **Image File Extensions**: We must consider different image file extensions (like .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, etc.) and ensure our parsing logic can handle all relevant types.\n\n4. **Non-Image Links**: An ORG file may contain links to non-image files or URLs that are not images. Our parser should distinguish between image files and other content.\n\n5. **Embedded Data**: Images can sometimes be embedded directly in base64 encoding within the file, rather than linked by a filename. This would be more complex to extract as a \"file name\".\n\n6. **Syntax Complexity**: Org mode supports a rich syntax, including directives and options that might complicate parsing (like #+ATTR_ORG lines that precede an image link). \n\n7. **Comments and Inactive Links**: The ORG file could contain commented-out links or inactive links which should not be treated as included image files.\n\nOnce we have the input ORG file, we would need to parse it, taking into consideration these potential obstacles to accurately extract the filenames of all included image files."
