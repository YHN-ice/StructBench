We need to know all the syntax variations used for embedding images in ORG files to accurately extract all of them.\n\n2. **Image Formats**: There are various image formats (like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.), and we might need to account for all these formats when extracting image filenames.\n\n3. **Linked vs Embedded Images**: Images can be either linked from external sources or embedded directly into the ORG file. We need to distinguish between the two if only embedded images are required.\n\n4. **File Paths**: Images might be included with relative or absolute paths, and sometimes the path may be complex or contain spaces, which could complicate extraction.\n\n5. **ORG Mode Markup**: ORG files may use special markup for organizing content (like * for headers or #+ for settings). The parser must correctly interpret this markup to avoid confusion with image syntax.\n\n6. **Comments**: Images could be within lines that are commented out. The parser must decide whether to extract image names from such lines or ignore them.\n\n7. **Multiline Links**: Sometimes links can be broken up over multiple lines for readability, which might pose a challenge for line-based parsing.\n\n8. **Embedded Code Blocks**: An image link might be within a code block or example block, which should perhaps be treated differently than regular text.\n\n9. **File Accessibility**: If verification of the existence of image files is required, we could face issues with file permissions or missing files.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, we would need a robust set of rules or heuristics to accurately extract all image filenames from the ORG file. Now, please provide the input ORG file content for further assistance."
