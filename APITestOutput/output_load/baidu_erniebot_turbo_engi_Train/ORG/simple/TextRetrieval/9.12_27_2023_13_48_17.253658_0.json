It is essential to know the exact syntax (usually text wrapped with multiple asterisks, e.g., `**bold text**`) that signifies bold formatting.\n\n2. **Handling edge cases**: Bold text might be adjacent to other formatting or special characters, which could complicate the extraction process. For example, bold syntax might be directly next to a bullet point, another element of markup like italic or underlined text, or within a complex structure like a table or code block.\n\n3. **Contextual interpretation**: In some cases, asterisks might be used for different purposes other than bold formatting (like lists or as a wildcard character). The parser must distinguish when asterisks are used for bold text versus other functions.\n\n4. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might include other formatting within it, like italic or code snippet. The parser should either preserve or appropriately handle the nested formatting depending on the requirements.\n\n5. **Multi-line bold text**: If the bold text spans multiple lines, the parser must be able to detect and extract the entire section without truncating at line breaks, if that's how bold is represented in ORG.\n\n6. **Incomplete or malformed markup**: The file might contain incorrectly formatted bold text that doesn't follow the proper syntax. The parser needs to decide whether to include these as bold texts or not.\n\n7. **Performance with large files**: If the ORG file is large, parsing performance might be a concern, and efficient algorithms or methods would need to be applied.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser needs to be robust enough to accurately identify and extract bold text while dealing with these various scenarios."
