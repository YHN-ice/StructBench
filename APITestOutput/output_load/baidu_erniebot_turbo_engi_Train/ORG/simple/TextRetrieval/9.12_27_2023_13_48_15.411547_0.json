Bold text is commonly denoted by asterisks, so determining the correct syntax for bold (typically `*text*`) is necessary.\n\n2. **Escaped characters:** Text that appears to be formatted as bold may be escaped (e.g., `*text\\*`), meaning it's not actually bold but rather includes literal asterisks. Recognizing and handling escaped characters properly is important.\n\n3. **Nested formatting:** Bold text might contain other formatting, such as italic or underlined text, which could complicate extraction (e.g., `*bold /italic/*`). Handling nested formatting while extracting only the bold portion is a challenge.\n\n4. **Multiline bold text:** Bold text might span multiple lines, and ensuring that the entire bold passage is captured without losing the multiline context is important.\n\n5. **Inconsistent formatting:** Users might incorrectly format text, such as uneven asterisk pairs (e.g., `*bold text`), which makes it hard to determine if the text was intended to be bold.\n\n6. **Embedded code or examples:** ORG files can include blocks of code or examples that use asterisks in ways unrelated to text formatting. These need to be distinguished from actual bold formatting.\n\nTo effectively extract bold texts, the parser must be able to handle these complexities and accurately identify the intended bold formatting."
