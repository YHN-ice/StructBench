The parser has to distinguish between image links and other types of links.\n3. **External vs. Local Images**: The ORG file may include external image URLs as well as paths to local image files. The parser must correctly identify and handle both types.\n4. **File Path Ambiguity**: File paths for images could be absolute or relative, and in the case of relative paths, it may not always be clear what they are relative to.\n5. **Embedded Base64 Images**: Images might be embedded directly in the file using Base64 encoding rather than linked by a filename.\n6. **Commented or Inactive Code**: Images could be included in sections of the ORG file that are commented out or otherwise meant to be inactive, and the parser must decide whether to consider these.\n\nOnce the input ORG file is provided, the specifics of these challenges can be addressed more concretely."
