Identifying the correct level is essential.\n\n4. **Embedded Content**: The subsection could contain different types of content like code blocks, quotes, or links which might need special consideration while extracting.\n\n5. **File Size**: If the ORG file is large, it might be challenging to locate the specific subsection without proper indexing or search capabilities.\n\n6. **Incomplete or Incorrect Input**: If the input file is not fully provided or is poorly formatted, it might be difficult to extract the correct information.\n\n7. **External References**: The content might reference external files or URLs which are not included in the original ORG file, making it impossible to provide complete context.\n\nOnce the input ORG file is provided, I can attempt to parse it accordingly while keeping these potential difficulties in mind."
