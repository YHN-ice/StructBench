Some might include additional spaces, use different numbers of asterisks, or include tags that could complicate parsing.\n\n3. **Text Content vs. Metadata**: ORG files can contain both content (text, lists, links) and metadata (timestamps, properties, tags). Differentiating between the two and extracting only the relevant content for the subsection could be challenging.\n\n4. **Embedded Elements**: Elements like links, TODO items, or code blocks within the subsection might have specific syntax that needs to be retained in the excerpt.\n\n5. **Incomplete Sections**: If the file is incomplete or sections are not well-defined, it could be difficult to determine where a subsection begins and ends.\n\n6. **File Size and Complexity**: Large files with many sections and subsections can lead to performance issues or make it more difficult to accurately locate and extract the desired content.\n\n7. **Encoding and Special Characters**: The file encoding and any special characters used within the ORG file have to be accurately handled to maintain the integrity of the content.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file, I can apply these considerations to parse the file and provide the correct answer."
