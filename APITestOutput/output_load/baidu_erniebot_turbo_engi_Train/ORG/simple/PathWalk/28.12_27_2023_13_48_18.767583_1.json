Being able to correctly interpret the formatting to determine hierarchy is important.\n\n3. **Incomplete Sections**: If a section or subsection is incomplete or improperly formatted, it could complicate the extraction of the desired content.\n\n4. **Large Content**: If the section has a large amount of content, it might be challenging to extract just the relevant subsection without including adjacent content.\n\n5. **Embedded Code or Tables**: ORG files can contain embedded code blocks, tables, or other special syntax elements that need to be parsed correctly.\n\n6. **Links and References**: Internal or external links and references might be included, which should be correctly interpreted and presented as part of the content.\n\n7. **Metadata**: ORG files can contain metadata (like TODO status, tags) which might not be considered part of the actual content but need to be recognized and processed accordingly.\n\n8. **File Access**: Given that the ORG file content isn't directly in my processing environment, there would be the basic obstacle of accessing the content of the file before any parsing can begin.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles will help in providing an accurate response once the input file is available for parsing."
