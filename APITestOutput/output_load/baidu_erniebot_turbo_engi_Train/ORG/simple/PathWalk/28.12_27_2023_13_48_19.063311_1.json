Ambiguity in numbering: Ensuring that \"1th\" is interpreted correctly as \"first\" and understanding the hierarchical structure of the ORG file to identify the correct sections and subsections.\n\n2. Hierarchical structure: ORG files have a nested structure where sections can contain subsections. Without clear markers or consistent formatting, it could be challenging to distinguish between different levels of content.\n\n3. Incomplete information: If the ORG file is very large or complex, it may not be possible to display the entire content of a section or subsection in one response, requiring a strategy to handle excerpts.\n\n4. Special formatting and directives: ORG files can contain special formatting, links, TODO items, tags, and other directives that need to be interpreted correctly in the context of the question asked.\n\n5. Contextual interpretation: Understanding the context of the file and how it relates to the content of the subsection being asked about.\n\n6.
