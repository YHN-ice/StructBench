Improper use or declaration of namespaces can lead to structural problems.\n\n5. **DTD or Schema violations**: If an XML document is supposed to adhere to a Document Type Definition (DTD) or an XML Schema Definition (XSD) and it does not conform to the defined structure, it would be considered an error.
