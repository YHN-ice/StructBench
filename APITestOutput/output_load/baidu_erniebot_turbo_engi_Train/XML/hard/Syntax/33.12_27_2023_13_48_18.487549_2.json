Missing quotes around attribute values: Attribute values should be enclosed in quotes.\n\n3. Undefined entities: All entities used in the document must be defined, except for the predefined entities in XML.\n\n4. Usage of illegal characters: Characters like \"<\" and \"&\" must be escaped.\n\n5. Error in the XML declaration: The XML declaration must be correct, if present, including the version number and encoding.\n\n6. Incorrect hierarchy or order of elements: Elements must appear in a hierarchy that conforms to the defined schema or DTD.\n\n7. Multiple root elements: An XML document should have one and only one root element.\n\n8.
