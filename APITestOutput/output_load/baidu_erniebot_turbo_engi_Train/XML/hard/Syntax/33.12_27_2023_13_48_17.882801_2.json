Nested tags not properly closed: Tags must be closed in the reverse order that they are opened.\n4. Missing attribute quotes: Attribute values must be enclosed in quotes.\n5. Improper use of special characters: Special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, etc., must be escaped.\n6. Case sensitivity: XML tags are case-sensitive, so `<Tag>` and `<tag>` would be considered different elements.\n7.
