If either is missing, it's a structural error.\n\n2. **Mismatched tags**: Every opening tag must be paired with a corresponding closing tag with the same name.\n\n3. **Nesting errors**: Elements must be properly nested within each other. For example, if you have `<parent><child></parent></child>`, this is incorrect because the `<child>` element is not properly closed before closing the `<parent>` element.\n\n4. **Attribute errors**: Attributes must be quoted properly, and an element cannot have two attributes with the same name.\n\n5. **Invalid characters**: Certain characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` need to be escaped in text nodes and attribute values (for example, using `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and `&amp;` respectively).\n\n6. **Declaration issues**: An XML declaration, if present, must be at the start of the document, and it should be properly formatted (e.g., `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>`).\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the XML content I am given, they would represent structural errors.
