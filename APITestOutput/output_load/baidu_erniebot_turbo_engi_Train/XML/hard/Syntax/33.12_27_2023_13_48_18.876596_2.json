Mismatched or unclosed tags: Every start tag in XML must have a corresponding end tag. An unclosed tag would result in a structural error.\n2. Nesting errors: Tags must be properly nested within each other, meaning that if a tag is opened within another tag, it must be closed before the outer tag is closed.\n3. Case sensitivity: XML tags are case-sensitive. A start tag and its corresponding end tag must match in their case.\n4. Attribute errors: Attributes must be properly defined within start tags, with their values enclosed in quotes.\n5. Prolog issues: The XML declaration (prolog) should be at the beginning of the file and properly formatted.\n6. Special characters: Characters like \"<\", \">\", \"&\", etc., must be escaped using character references if they appear in the content or attribute values.\n\nIf I encounter any of these issues in the provided XML content, I will flag them as true structural errors.
