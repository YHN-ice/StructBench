Character Encoding: If the XML file uses a character encoding that is not properly declared or supported, it could lead to issues when trying to read and interpret the content.\n\n5. Special Characters: Special characters in XML need to be correctly escaped; otherwise, they might be misinterpreted by the parser.\n\n6.
