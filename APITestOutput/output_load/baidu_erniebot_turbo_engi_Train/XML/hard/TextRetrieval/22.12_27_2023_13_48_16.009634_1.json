For example, if some tags have an attribute 'value' while others use 'val', it may require extra processing to determine if they are equivalent.\n\n2. **Multiple Attributes**: A single tag might have multiple attributes, so ensuring we're checking the correct attribute for the 'hx' value is essential.\n\n3. **Namespaces**: If the XML uses namespaces, I need to be aware of them because they affect how tags and attributes are identified and accessed.\n\n4. **Large Files and Performance**: If the XML file is very large, it might be difficult to parse it efficiently. Performance considerations could become an obstacle.\n\n5. **Complex Hierarchies**: Navigating a complex hierarchy of elements to locate the correct tag with the specific attribute could be challenging, especially if there are many nested elements.\n\n6. **Special Character Handling**: XML attributes and tags could contain special characters or entities that need to be decoded or handled correctly.\n\n7. **Case Sensitivity**: XML is case-sensitive, so searching for 'hx' is different from 'Hx', 'hX', or 'HX'. Care must be taken to match the exact case.\n\n8. **Incomplete or Malformed XML**: If the XML is not well-formed (e.g., missing end tags, unquoted attributes), it might not be parsable without pre-processing to correct the errors.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it may be necessary to employ robust XML parsing libraries or tools that can handle these complexities and ensure accurate extraction of information from the XML file."
