Without knowing the attributes, it may be hard to ascertain the right tag.\n\n5. **Parsing Errors:** Malformed XML with issues such as unclosed tags, illegal characters, or incorrect nesting could lead to parsing errors.\n\n6. **Character Encoding Issues:** If the XML file uses a character encoding that is not properly declared or supported, it may result in incorrect parsing of content.\n\n7. **Text within Child Elements:** If the target tag contains nested child elements with their own text content, it might be challenging to extract only the text pertaining to the parent tag without including child content.\n\n8. **CData Sections:** Content within CDATA sections might need special handling as they are intended to be treated as raw text data that should not be parsed as XML.\n\n9. **Large File Size:** A very large XML file could pose performance issues and make parsing slower, which could be problematic when processing time is a concern.\n\nTo address these challenges, it is important to have a reliable XML parsing library or tool and a clear understanding of the structure and schema of the XML file in question.
