However, I can guide you through parsing an XML file or provide information on how to do it.\n\nIf I were to parse an XML file, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might occur:\n\n1. **Ill-formed XML**: If the XML file is not well-formed (meaning it doesn't adhere to the basic syntax rules of XML), a parser might not be able to interpret it. For instance, not having matching opening and closing tags or having nested elements improperly can cause issues.\n\n2. **Namespaces**: Sometimes XML elements have namespaces which can complicate the parsing process if not handled correctly. The parser needs to understand and correctly handle namespaces.\n\n3. **Character Encoding**: If the XML file uses a different encoding than the parser expects, some characters may not be read correctly.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the XML file is very large, it may not fit into memory, or it could take a long time to parse. Stream processing or other memory-efficient techniques might be required.\n\n5. **Complex Hierarchies**: Deeply nested or complex XML hierarchies can be difficult to navigate and extract data from, especially if you're looking for specific information that's several layers deep.\n\n6. **Special Characters & Escaping**: XML has some special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, etc., which need to be escaped in content. If they are not escaped properly, it might lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Schema Validation**: The XML file should ideally conform to a specific schema or DTD (Document Type Definition). If there's a requirement for validation against such a schema and the XML doesn't match it, the parser should report this.\n\nTo proceed with parsing an XML file, I would typically ask you to provide the content of the file as text input. Then, using pseudocode or guiding you through the steps, I would help extract the content of a specific tag such as \"RB\"."
