The parser needs to handle these cases and determine which element’s content is relevant to the question.\n\n10. **Attributes vs. Text Content**: Some questions may not clarify whether they're asking for an element's text content or an attribute value, leading to potential confusion.\n\n11. **Tool Limitations**: Depending on the XML parsing tool or library used, there may be limitations or bugs that affect the ability to retrieve certain information from the XML file.\n\nThese are general considerations, and upon seeing the actual XML input, there may be additional context-specific challenges that arise.
