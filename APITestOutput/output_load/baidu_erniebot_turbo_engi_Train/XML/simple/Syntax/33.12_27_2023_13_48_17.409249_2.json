A common error is when an element is opened but not closed within the scope of its parent element, or when elements are closed out of order.\n\n2. **Tag Mismatch**: Every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag with the same name.\n\n3. **Attribute Errors**: Attribute values must be quoted, and attributes must be properly formed within their associated tags.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Characters such as \"<\" and \"&\" must be written as entity references (like `&lt;` and `&amp;`) unless used as markup delimiters.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Extraneous Content**: Missing information or extraneous text or elements outside the structure of the XML can cause errors.\n\n6. **Case Sensitivity**: XML tags are case-sensitive. Hence, `<Tag>` and `<tag>` would be considered different elements.\n\n7. **Proper Declaration**: The XML should start with a proper XML declaration.\n\n8. **Syntax Compliance**: The XML file should comply with the syntax rules such as no single quotes around attribute values in XML declaration, no spaces in tag names, etc.\n\nTo identify structural errors, we need to check for these potential issues by examining the input XML file's content.
