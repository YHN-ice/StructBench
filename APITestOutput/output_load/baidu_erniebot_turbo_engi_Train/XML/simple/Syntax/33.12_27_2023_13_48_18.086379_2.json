Missing either can cause structural errors.\n\n2. **Improperly nested elements:** In XML, elements must be properly nested within each other. For example, if an element is opened within another element, it must be closed before its parent element is closed.\n\n3. **Attribute syntax errors:** Attributes in XML must be quoted correctly and cannot contain certain characters like \"<\" or \"&\" unless they are escaped.\n\n4. **Special character handling:** If special characters (like \"<\", \">\", \"&\", etc.) are not handled correctly (e.g., using `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and `&amp;`), they can cause parsing errors.\n\n5. **Incorrect case in tags:** XML tags are case-sensitive, so `<Tag>` and `<tag>` would be considered different elements.\n\n6. **Encoding issues:** If the XML declaration specifies a certain encoding but the actual content is in a different encoding, it can lead to errors when parsing.\n\n7. **Incorrect document structure:** All XML documents must have one root element that contains all other elements.\n\n8. **Invalid characters or sequences:** XML has restrictions on which characters can be used, and certain sequences of characters may be invalid or require special handling.\n\n9. **Namespace conflicts or errors:** If the XML uses namespaces, they must be defined and used correctly to avoid conflicts or errors in parsing.\n\nBefore proceeding to parse the XML file provided, these are some common issues to watch out for.
