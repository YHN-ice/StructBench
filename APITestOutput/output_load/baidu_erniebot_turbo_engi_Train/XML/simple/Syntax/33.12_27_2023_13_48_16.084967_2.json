An opening tag <Item> does not match a closing tag </item>.\n3. **Incomplete Tags**: A tag must be properly opened and closed, with no missing angle brackets.\n4. **Nesting Errors**: Tags must be properly nested within each other. For example, <parent><child></parent></child> is incorrect; it should be <parent><child></child></parent>.\n5. **Special Characters**: Special characters like \"<\", \">\", \"&\", etc., must be escaped or wrapped in a CDATA section.\n6. **Attribute Formatting**: Attributes must be within opening tags and must be quoted correctly, either with single or double quotes.\n7. **XML Declaration**: If present, the XML declaration must be at the beginning of the document and correctly formatted.\n8. **Prolog and DOCTYPE**: If used, the prolog and DOCTYPE declarations must be correctly structured.\n9. **Uniqueness of Attribute Names**: Within a single element, attribute names must be unique.\n10. **Invalid Characters**: XML documents should not contain invalid characters or character sequences.\n\nPlease paste the XML content you're inquiring about, and I'll help you identify if there are any structural errors based on the information above."
