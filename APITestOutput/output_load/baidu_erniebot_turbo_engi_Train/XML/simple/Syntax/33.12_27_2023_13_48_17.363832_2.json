A common error is when tags are not properly matched.\n\n2. **Nesting errors**: Tags in XML must be properly nested within each other. This means that if a tag is opened within another tag, it must be closed before the outer tag is closed.\n\n3. **Missing closing tags**: Sometimes, a closing tag may be omitted entirely, which would result in an incomplete structure.\n\n4. **Typographical errors in tags**: Errors in spelling or case (since XML is case-sensitive) can cause a mismatch between opening and closing tags.\n\n5. **Attribute syntax errors**: Attributes must be quoted correctly, with values enclosed in single or double quotes.\n\n6. **Duplicate attributes**: Within a single element, attributes must be unique.\n\n7. **Special character handling**: Special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, etc., need to be escaped or wrapped in a CDATA section to avoid being interpreted as XML markup.\n\n8. **Correct hierarchy/order of elements**: Some XML documents have a predefined order for elements, and deviation from this order can be considered a structural error.\n\n9. **Unescaped ampersands**: Ampersands that are not part of an entity reference should be escaped as `&amp;`.\n\n10. **Prolog issues**: Problems with the XML declaration, such as incorrect syntax or character encoding issues.\n\n11. **Namespace declarations and usage**: Incorrect namespace usage or undeclared namespaces could lead to errors, though these may be more semantic than strictly structural.\n\n12. **Comments and processing instructions**: Improper syntax in comments (`<!-- -->`) or processing instructions (`<? ?>`) can cause issues.\n\nDetermining the presence of these issues requires careful parsing of the XML content.
