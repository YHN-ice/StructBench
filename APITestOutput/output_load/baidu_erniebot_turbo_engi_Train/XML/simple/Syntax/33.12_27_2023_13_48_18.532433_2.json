Incorrect nesting of elements: In XML, elements must be properly nested within each other; for example, `<parent><child></parent></child>` is incorrect.\n\n4. Undefined namespace prefixes: If a namespace prefix is used, it must be defined.\n\n5. Duplicate attribute names: Within a single element, an attribute name must not appear more than once.\n\n6. Misuse of XML declaration: The XML declaration, if present, must be at the beginning of the document, and it should be correctly formed.\n\n7.
