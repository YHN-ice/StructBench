A common error is when these tags are not properly matched or nested.\n\n2. **Missing closing tags**: A tag that is opened but not closed can lead to a parsing failure.\n\n3. **Typos in tag names**: Even a small typo in a tag name can cause a structural error, as the opening and closing tags would not match.\n\n4. **Attribute errors**: Attributes must be enclosed in quotes and should be properly formatted. Missing quotes or equal signs can lead to errors.\n\n5. **Improper nesting**: XML elements must be properly nested within each other. An element that overlaps another improperly can cause an error.\n\n6. **Special characters**: Certain characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `'` and `\"` must be escaped in XML content; otherwise, they could be interpreted as markup, leading to errors.\n\n7. **XML Prolog issues**: The XML declaration (prolog) at the beginning of an XML file must be correctly formatted. An error here could affect the entire document.\n\n8. **Namespace issues**: If the XML uses namespaces, they need to be correctly declared and used throughout the document.\n\n9. **Doctype declaration**: If present, the doctype declaration must be correctly formatted and should match the DTD (Document Type Definition) it refers to.\n\n10. **Encoding issues**: If the encoding specified in the XML declaration does not match the actual encoding of the file, this can cause parsing errors.\n\nThese are among the common issues that might need to be checked when parsing an XML file for structural integrity."
