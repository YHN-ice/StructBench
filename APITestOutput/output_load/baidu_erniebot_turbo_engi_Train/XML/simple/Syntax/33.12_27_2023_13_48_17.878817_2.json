For example, if you have `<a><b></a></b>`, this is incorrect because `<b>` is closed after `<a>` is closed.\n\n3. **Attribute Errors**: Attributes should be enclosed in quotes, and each attribute should have a unique name within a single element.\n\n4. **Syntax Errors**: Illegal characters might be used, or the prolog might be missing or incorrect.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: The specified encoding in the XML declaration must match the actual encoding of the file.\n\n6. **Duplicate ID Values**: If an ID type attribute is used, each ID value must be unique within the XML document.\n\n7. **Invalid Characters**: Certain characters are illegal in XML and they need to be escaped properly, for example, the ampersand (`&`) should be written as `&amp;`.\n\n8. **Namespace Problems**: If namespaces are used, they need to be declared, and elements or attributes must be properly qualified.\n\nThese issues are among the common structural errors that could exist in an XML file.
