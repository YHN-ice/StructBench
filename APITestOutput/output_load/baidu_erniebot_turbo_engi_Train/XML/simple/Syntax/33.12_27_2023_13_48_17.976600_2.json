Here are a few potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. **Mismatched Tags**: Every opening tag in XML must have a corresponding closing tag. Checking for mismatched tags can be tricky if the XML is complex and deeply nested.\n\n2. **Unclosed Tags**: An unclosed tag is a common error where a tag is opened but not properly closed, which can lead to parsing errors.\n\n3. **Improper Nesting**: Tags in XML must be properly nested within each other. For example, `<parent><child></parent></child>` is incorrect because the `child` tags are not properly nested within the `parent` tags.\n\n4. **Illegal Characters**: XML has a set of characters that are illegal in certain contexts, such as the ampersand (`&`) and the less-than (`<`) sign. These characters must be escaped properly.\n\n5. **Attribute Errors**: Attributes in opening tags must be quoted correctly (either with single or double quotes) and should not contain illegal characters.\n\n6. **XML Declaration Issues**: An XML declaration, if present, must be at the start of the document and correctly formatted.\n\n7. **Doctype Declaration**: If used, the Doctype declaration must be proper and before any element or entity.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If an XML declaration specifies a certain character encoding, the file must be in that encoding.\n\n9. **Inconsistent Case Sensitivity**: XML is case-sensitive; thus, inconsistent usage of case in tags could lead to errors.\n\n10. **Large File Size**: For very large XML files, the sheer size can make manual inspection for errors tedious and error-prone.\n\nThese potential issues would need to be scrutinized when attempting to validate an XML file.
