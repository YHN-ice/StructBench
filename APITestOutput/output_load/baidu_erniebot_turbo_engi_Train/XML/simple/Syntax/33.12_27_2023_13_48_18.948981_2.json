Unclosed tags: Every tag needs to be properly closed with either a closing tag or as a self-closing tag if it has no content (e.g., `<tag />`).\n\n3. Improper nesting of tags: Tags in XML must be properly nested within each other. A parent tag must close after all of its child tags have been closed.\n\n4. Illegal characters in tags or attribute names: Tag and attribute names must start with a letter or underscore and cannot contain spaces or start with the letters xml (in any case combination).\n\n5. Duplicate attribute names within the same element: Each attribute in an element must have a unique name.\n\n6. Missing required attributes or elements: If there's a schema or DTD (Document Type Definition) defined, all elements and attributes that are required by the schema or DTD must be present.\n\n7. Improper use of special characters: Special characters should be escaped using entities (e.g., `&` should be `&amp;`, `<` should be `&lt;`, `>` should be `&gt;`, etc.).\n\nThese are some potential structural problems that could exist in an XML file.
