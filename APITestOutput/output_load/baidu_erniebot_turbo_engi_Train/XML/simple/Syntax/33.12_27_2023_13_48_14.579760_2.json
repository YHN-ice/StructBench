Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered:\n\n1. Mismatched Tags: Ensuring that every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag is essential. A mismatch can lead to parsing errors.\n\n2. Non-closed Tags: In XML, all tags must be properly closed. Self-closing tags should end with \"/>\", and other tags should have a corresponding closing tag.\n\n3. Nesting Errors: Tags must be properly nested within each other. An incorrectly nested structure can invalidate the XML.\n\n4. Special Character Escaping: Characters like \"<\", \">\", \"&\", \"'\", and \"\\\"\" must be escaped using predefined entities (e.g., &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &apos;, &quot;) within text nodes.\n\n5. Attribute Formatting: Attributes in XML elements must be properly formatted with values enclosed in quotes.\n\n6. Duplicate Attributes: An element cannot have duplicate attributes.\n\n7. Syntax Errors: Basic syntax errors, such as missing angle brackets or incorrect use of quotes, can cause parsing problems.\n\n8. Encoding Issues: The XML declaration should correctly specify the encoding, and the content should match that encoding.\n\n9. Validity vs. Well-Formedness: An XML document might be well-formed (syntactically correct) but still not valid if it doesn't adhere to a defined schema or DTD.\n\n10. Incomplete Document: The provided XML content might be incomplete or truncated, leading to parsing issues.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the XML content provided, they would need to be identified to answer whether the XML has structural errors correctly.
