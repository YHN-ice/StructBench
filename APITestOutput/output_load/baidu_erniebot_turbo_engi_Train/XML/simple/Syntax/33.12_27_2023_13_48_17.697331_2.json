Missing closing tags - All tags must be closed either with a corresponding end tag or as a self-closing tag.\n3. Typos in tag names - Tag names must match exactly between opening and closing tags.\n4. Incorrect nesting of elements - Elements must be properly nested within each other; for example, an inner element must be closed before its containing element is closed.\n5. Unescaped special characters - Special characters like <, >, &, ', and \" must be escaped in text nodes and attribute values.\n6. Invalid attribute syntax - Attributes must be properly formatted with a name followed by an equals sign and a quoted value.\n7. Duplicated attributes - An element can't have the same attribute twice.\n8. Undefined entities - If the XML uses any entities other than the predefined entities (&lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &apos;, &quot;), they must be defined.\n9. Inconsistent case-sensitivity - XML tags are case-sensitive, so inconsistent case in opening and closing tags is an error.\n\nThese are just a few potential issues that could exist within an XML file.
