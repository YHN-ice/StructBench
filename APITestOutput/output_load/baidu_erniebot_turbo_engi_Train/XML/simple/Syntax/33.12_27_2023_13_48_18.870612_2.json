An obstacle would be if tags are misspelled, mismatched, or improperly nested.\n\n3. **Missing Quotes**: Attribute values in XML must be enclosed in quotes. A common error is omitting these quotes.\n\n4. **Improperly Closed Tags**: Tags must be closed properly with a forward slash before the closing angle bracket for empty elements, or with a corresponding closing tag for non-empty elements.\n\n5. **Special Characters**: If special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, etc., are not properly escaped within the text, they can cause issues.\n\n6. **Namespace Issues**: If there are namespaces declared, they need to be used consistently and correctly throughout the document.\n\n7. **Schema/Doctype Declaration Issues**: If the XML is supposed to conform to a DTD or Schema, and the declaration is either missing or incorrect, it could lead to validation errors.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the XML declaration specifies an encoding, then the file content must be in that encoding.\n\nTo provide a definitive answer regarding the presence of structural errors in an XML file, I would need to see the actual XML content.
