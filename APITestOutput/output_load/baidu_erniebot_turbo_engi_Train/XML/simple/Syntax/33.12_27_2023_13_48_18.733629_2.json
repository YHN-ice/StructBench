A common error is missing or mismatched tags, which can lead to invalid XML structure.\n\n2. **Improper Nesting**: Elements must be properly nested within each other. For example, if an opening tag for an element is inside another element, the closing tag must also be inside that same element.\n\n3. **Attribute Errors**: Each attribute on an element must have a value enclosed in quotes. Additionally, attribute names must be unique within an element.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: XML has a set of special characters that can cause issues if not escaped properly, for example, `&`, `<`, `>`, `\"` and `'`.\n\n5. **Proper Declaration**: The XML declaration (if present) should be at the start of the document and correctly formatted.\n\n6. **Consistency in Case Sensitivity**: XML tags are case-sensitive. This means that `<Tag>` and `<tag>` would be considered different elements.\n\n7. **Valid Root Element**: An XML document should have a single root element that contains all other elements.\n\n8. **Whitespace and Encoding Issues**: Excessive whitespace or incorrect encoding can sometimes cause issues in XML parsing.\n\nWhen you present the XML file, I'll be able to check for these and any other issues to determine if there are structural errors."
