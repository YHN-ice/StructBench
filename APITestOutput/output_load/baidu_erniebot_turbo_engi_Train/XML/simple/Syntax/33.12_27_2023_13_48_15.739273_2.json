Missing attribute quotes: Attribute values must be enclosed in quotes (single or double).\n\n3. Nested elements not properly closed: In XML, elements must be closed in the reverse order that they were opened.\n\n4. Special characters not escaped: Characters like \"<\", \">\", \"&\", \"'\", and '\"' should be escaped using predefined entities like &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &apos;, and &quot;.\n\n5. Syntax errors: XML is case-sensitive, so opening and closing tags must match in case. Also, there cannot be multiple root elements.\n\n6. Invalid document structure: XML documents must have a single root element that contains all other elements.\n\n7. Namespace issues: If namespaces are used, they need to be properly declared and used.\n\n8.
