If this is the case, it will be important to clarify which occurrence or all occurrences of content are needed.\n\n4. **Attributes vs. Text**: Tags can contain attributes and text content. If \"SB\" contains both, it should be clarified whether to retrieve only the text or both text and attribute values.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: If the file uses a specific encoding that is not properly declared or supported, it could create problems with correctly interpreting the characters.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the XML file is very large, it could pose performance issues for parsing and extracting data.\n\n7. **Invalid XML**: If the XML file is not well-formed (e.g., missing closing tags, unescaped characters, etc.), parsing might fail or return incorrect results.\n\n8. **Special Characters**: Special characters within the content of the \"SB\" tag might need to be handled differently when being extracted, depending on the context in which they are used.\n\nOnce we have access to the XML file, we can apply strategies to overcome these obstacles as needed."
