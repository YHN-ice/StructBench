Large XML Files: Very large XML files might pose a challenge due to memory constraints or could take a long time to process if not handled efficiently.\n\n3. Namespaces: XML namespaces are a way to avoid element name conflicts. If the XML uses namespaces, the parser needs to be aware of them to correctly interpret the tag names.\n\n4. Encoding: If the XML file's encoding isn't properly declared or is different from what the parser expects, there could be problems reading the file correctly.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: Special characters in XML are often escaped (e.g., &amp; for &). A parser must handle these correctly to return accurate content.\n\n6. CDATA Sections: Content within a CDATA section is not parsed by the XML parser. If HC's content is within a CDATA section, it must be extracted as-is.\n\n7.
