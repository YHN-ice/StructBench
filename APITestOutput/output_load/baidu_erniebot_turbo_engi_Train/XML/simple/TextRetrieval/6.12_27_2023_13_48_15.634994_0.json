Sometimes, users may confuse element attributes with the content.\n\n8. **CDATAs and Comments:** Handling CDATA sections and comments accurately as they may contain text that looks like XML tags but should not be treated as such.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust XML parser would need to be used, one that adheres to the XML standard and is capable of handling the various complexities of XML documents.
