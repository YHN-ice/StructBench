Knowing the exact hierarchy or path to the desired tag is crucial to correctly identify it.\n\n5. **Similar attribute values**: There could be several attributes with values that are similar or contain the target value as part of a longer string, which requires precise matching to find the exact value 'h'.\n\n6. **Case sensitivity**: XML is case-sensitive, so when searching for an attribute value, it's important to match the case exactly unless specified otherwise.\n\n7. **Large document size**: If the XML document is very large, parsing and searching through it could be resource-intensive and time-consuming.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles and provide an accurate answer, the XML file parser needs to be equipped with robust error handling, precise search capabilities, and efficient traversal methods.
