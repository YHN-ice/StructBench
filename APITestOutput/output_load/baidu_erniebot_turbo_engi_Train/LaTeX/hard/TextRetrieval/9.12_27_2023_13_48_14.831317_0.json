Different commands for bold: Bold text in LaTeX can be created using multiple commands, such as `\\textbf{}` or `{\\bfseries}`. Knowing all the possible commands that could create bold text is essential.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. Command parameters: Bold commands could have optional parameters that are not part of the text intended to be bold but still appear within the curly braces.\n\n4. Inline versus block: Bold text can appear both inline with other text or as a standalone block. Ensuring the parser handles both cases correctly is important.\n\n5. Incomplete or broken commands: The LaTeX file might contain errors, such as incomplete or broken bold text commands, which could lead to incorrect or partial extraction of text.\n\n6. Environment-specific bolding: Some bold text might be within environments that inherently make text bold, like `\\section{}` or `\\subsection{}`, and these cases may need special handling.\n\n7. Custom macros: The document might define custom macros that internally use bold commands, which would require the parser to understand and expand such macros to extract the text correctly.\n\n8. Escaped characters: Characters that are part of LaTeX syntax but escaped to be displayed literally (such as `\\{` or `\\}`) should not be confused with command delimiters.\n\nConsidering these factors in advance will help in designing a robust parser that can handle the complexities of LaTeX formatting to accurately extract all bold texts."
