The parser needs to recognize all of them.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, making it challenging to isolate the bold text.\n\n3. **Special characters**: LaTeX files often contain special characters and commands that may not be part of the actual text, such as `&`, `%`, `\\\\`, `\\cite{}`, `\\ref{}`, etc. These need to be handled or ignored appropriately.\n\n4. **Multiple lines**: Bold text might span across multiple lines or paragraphs, which requires the parser to maintain the context and not just look at individual lines in isolation.\n\n5. **Parameters inside commands**: Some bold commands might include additional parameters that are not part of the text to be extracted, such as `\\textbf[parameter]{text}`.\n\n6. **Escaped characters**: Characters that signify LaTeX commands might be escaped (e.g., `\\%`), which means they should be treated as literal characters rather than command initiators.\n\n7. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments in the document that are not rendered, starting with `%`. If bold text appears within a comment, it should typically not be extracted.\n\n8. **Brace matching**: LaTeX commands use curly braces `{}` to enclose arguments. The parser needs to correctly match opening and closing braces, taking into account nested braces as well.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser must navigate these complexities effectively."
