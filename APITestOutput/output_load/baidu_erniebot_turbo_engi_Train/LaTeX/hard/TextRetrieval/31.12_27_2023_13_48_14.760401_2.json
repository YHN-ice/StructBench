A few potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise include:\n\n1. Various Commands: LaTeX has multiple commands to include figures, such as \\includegraphics, \\insertfigure, etc. The parser must recognize all possible commands used for including figures.\n\n2. Figure Options: The \\includegraphics command may have options that alter the presentation of the figure, like scale, width, height, etc. These options are usually included in square brackets before the file name and need to be correctly parsed to extract the file name.\n\n3. File Path Formats: File names can be provided with or without the file extension and might include relative or absolute paths. The parser must handle all these variations to extract the correct file name.\n\n4. Multiple Figures in One Command: Some LaTeX packages allow including multiple figures within a single command. The parser should be able to handle such cases.\n\n5. Comments: LaTeX allows for comments in the text using the % symbol. If a figure inclusion command is commented out, it should not be considered by the parser.\n\n6. Custom Commands and Environments: Sometimes users define custom commands or environments to include figures. The parser must be equipped to recognize these as well.\n\n7. Nested Files: Large LaTeX documents might use \\input or \\include commands to bring in content from other files. If figures are included in these nested files, the parser must recursively search them as well.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parsing logic must be robust and flexible enough to handle a variety of LaTeX syntaxes and scenarios."
