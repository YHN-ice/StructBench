Multiple Commands: LaTeX has various commands to include graphics, such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, and `\\include`. We need to know all the commands that can be used to include figures.\n\n2. Command Options: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options, which might complicate the extraction of the file name.\n\n3. Relative and Absolute Paths: File names can include relative paths (e.g., `./images/fig1.png`) or absolute paths (e.g., `/home/user/images/fig1.png`), which can vary in complexity.\n\n4. File Extensions: LaTeX allows for the omission of file extensions in the `\\includegraphics` command, and the compiler will automatically search for common graphic file types (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.eps`).\n\n5. Multiple Figures in One Command: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple files, especially when using custom commands or environments.\n\n6. Comments: Figures might be commented out, and care must be taken not to extract those as they are not actually included in the final document.\n\n7. Custom Commands and Environments: Users can define their own commands and environments which could encapsulate the inclusion of figures, making it harder to identify without understanding those user definitions.\n\n8. File Naming Conventions: Some file names may contain special characters or spaces which require special handling or detection.\n\n9. Enclosed in Other Environments: Figures might be enclosed within other environments (e.g., `figure`, `minipage`), and the parser needs to recognize these environments to correctly extract the file names.\n\nUnderstanding these difficulties will help in creating a robust parsing strategy to accurately extract the names of included figure files from the LaTeX source."
