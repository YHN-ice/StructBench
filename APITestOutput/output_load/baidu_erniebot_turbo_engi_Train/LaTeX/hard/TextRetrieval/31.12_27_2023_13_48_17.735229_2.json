Identifying all commands that include figures is necessary.\n2. **File Extensions**: LaTeX allows including graphics without specifying the file extension, assuming that the correct one can be found by the compiler. This means the parser should consider possible extensions if they're not explicitly provided.\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Figures might be included using relative or absolute paths. Handling both is necessary to correctly extract the filenames.\n4. **Figure Environments**: Figures might be included within different environments (like figure, overpic, or even tikzpicture). The parser should recognize these environments.\n5. **Comments**: Lines in LaTeX that are commented out should not be considered as they are not processed by LaTeX.\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: A single \\includegraphics command might include multiple files if using a loop or a command redefinition that processes several files.\n7. **Optional Arguments**: The \\includegraphics command may contain optional arguments that alter how the figure is displayed but are not part of the file name (like scaling or rotation options).\n8. **Commands Defined in External Files**: Sometimes, LaTeX documents define new commands in external files or use packages that redefine commands. A parser should be aware of these custom definitions when they impact figure inclusion.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, let's await the input LaTeX document to start the extraction process."
