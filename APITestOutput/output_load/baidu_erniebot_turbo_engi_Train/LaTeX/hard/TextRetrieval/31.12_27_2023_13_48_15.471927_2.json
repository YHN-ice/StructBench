Identifying all possible commands used for including figures can be challenging.\n\n2. **Path Specifications**: Figuring out the correct path to the image file. The path can be absolute or relative, and it may contain directories which should be correctly parsed.\n\n3. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command may have optional arguments that could complicate the extraction process, such as scaling, rotation, and clipping options.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, LaTeX users include multiple figures within a single command (for example, using `subfigure` or `subfloat`), which could make it tricky to extract individual file names.\n\n5. **Comments**: Figure inclusion commands might be commented out within the LaTeX source, meaning they're not actually included in the final document. It's important to recognize and ignore commented lines.\n\n6. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The LaTeX document may define custom commands or environments that internally include figures. Without recognizing these customizations, figure file names might be missed.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX compilers allow for omitting the file extension of the images; this means that the parser would need to consider image files without extensions as valid.\n\n8. **Files Included from Other Files**: The LaTeX document might modularize content by including figure commands from other files using `\\input` or similar. Resolving the correct file names would then also depend on the content of these other files.\n\nTo successfully extract all figure file names, the parser must be able to handle these potential issues."
