The parser must recognize all possibilities.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text may be nested inside other commands, or other formatting may be nested inside bold text. The parser should handle such nesting properly.\n\n3. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to enclose arguments of commands. Extracting text requires correct matching of braces, even when they are nested.\n\n4. **Comments**: The LaTeX file may contain comments, signified by `%`. Text within comments should not be extracted as they are not rendered in the final document.\n\n5. **Multiple Lines**: Bold text commands may span multiple lines, and the parser should be able to handle line breaks within the command.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: Some LaTeX commands may have optional arguments that could precede the actual text. These should be ignored when extracting the bold text.\n\n7. **Environment Blocks**: Bold text may also be defined within environment blocks like `\\begin{...}` and `\\end{...}`. Correctly parsing these blocks is necessary.\n\n8. **Custom Commands**: The document may define custom commands for making text bold, which would require understanding of the LaTeX file preamble.\n\nGiven these potential issues, I'll need to see the specific LaTeX input file to accurately extract the bold texts."
