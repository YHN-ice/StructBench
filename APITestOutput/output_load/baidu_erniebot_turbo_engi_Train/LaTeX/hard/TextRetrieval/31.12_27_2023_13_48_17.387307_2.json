Different commands for figures: LaTeX can include figures using different commands, such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\epsfig`, or `\\pgfimage`. The parser must recognize all the possible ways figures can be included.\n\n2. File path complexity: The file paths for the figures might include absolute or relative paths, and they could be within nested directories. The parser should be able to extract the full path or the specific file name depending on what is required.\n\n3. Missing file extensions: In LaTeX, it's common to omit the file extension when including a figure, because LaTeX can automatically determine the appropriate file type. The parser might need to infer the extension or recognize that it's missing.\n\n4. Figure environments: Figures might be included within different environments, such as `figure`, `subfigure`, or custom-defined environments. The parser should understand these contexts to properly extract the file names.\n\n5. Commented lines: Sometimes, lines in LaTeX files are commented out with the `%` symbol. The parser needs to ignore any figures included in commented lines.\n\n6. Multiple figures in one command: A single command might include multiple figures, especially when using subfigures or a matrix of images. The parser should be able to handle and extract multiple file names from a single line if needed.\n\n7. Optional arguments: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments for scaling, rotating, or cropping images. The parser needs to differentiate between optional arguments and file names.\n\nWith these potential difficulties in mind, I can now proceed to parse the given LaTeX file once you provide it and extract the figure file names while overcoming these obstacles."
