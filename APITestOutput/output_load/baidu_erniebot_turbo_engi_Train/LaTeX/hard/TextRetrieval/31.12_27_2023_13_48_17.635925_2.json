We need to ignore these arguments to extract the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. If the include line is commented out, it should not be counted.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: Sometimes LaTeX allows for multiple figures to be included in a single line, separated by commas within the `\\includegraphics` command.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that include graphics, which would require parsing new commands.\n\n8. **File Extensions**: Sometimes the file extension is omitted in the `\\includegraphics` command because LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type. We might need to infer or search for the file extensions if they are not explicitly mentioned.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we would need to proceed with caution and ensure our parser can handle these situations effectively. Now you may provide the LaTeX input so I can attempt to extract the figure file names correctly."
