The parser should handle both cases properly.\n\n8. **Error Handling**: The LaTeX file may contain syntax errors or incomplete commands, which could throw off the parser's accuracy.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser must be carefully designed to accurately identify and extract only the content that is explicitly formatted as bold within the LaTeX file's structure."
