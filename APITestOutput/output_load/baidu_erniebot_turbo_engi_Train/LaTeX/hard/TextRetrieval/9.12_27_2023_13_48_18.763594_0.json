It's important to identify all possible commands that signify bold text.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which could complicate extraction. For instance, you might have a bold command inside an italic command like `\\textit{\\textbf{bold text}}`.\n\n3. **Brackets and braces**: Correctly identifying the opening and closing braces `{}` that contain the bold text is essential. LaTeX allows for braces to be nested, which can make it tricky to determine the exact content to be extracted.\n\n4. **Comments**: The LaTeX file may contain comments, which start with `%`. Anything on a line after a `%` should usually be ignored as it is not rendered in the final document.\n\n5. **Custom commands and environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that change the default behavior of bold commands or include bold text in a non-standard way.\n\n6. **Conditional text**: There could be conditional statements in the LaTeX file that include or exclude text from being rendered based on certain conditions. This could affect whether text is actually bold in the final document.\n\nOnce we have the input file, these factors will need to be considered when parsing the file to extract the bold text accurately."
