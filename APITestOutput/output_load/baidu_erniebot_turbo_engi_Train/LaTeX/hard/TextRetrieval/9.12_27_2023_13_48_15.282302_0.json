Different commands for bold text: The most common command for bold text in LaTeX is `\\textbf{}`, but there may also be custom commands defined in the LaTeX file preamble or other styles of making text bold, e.g., using the `\\bf` or `\\bfseries` command inside a group. We need to handle all possible variations.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text can also be within other formatting commands, such as italic, underline, etc. Extracting bold text that is nested within other commands can be tricky.\n\n3. Environment-based formatting: Bold text could be inside a specific environment that changes the style of the text, for example, within a `theorem` environment which automatically sets its content to bold.\n\n4. Comments and inactive text: Text within comments (`%`) should not be considered as it is not rendered in the final document.\n\n5. Multiple lines and line breaks: Bold text may span across multiple lines or contain LaTeX line breaks (`\\\\`), which should be taken into account when extracting the text.\n\n6. Optional arguments: Some LaTeX commands have optional arguments that could affect how the command behaves. If `\\textbf` has optional arguments, parsing might need to consider them.\n\n7. Custom macros: The document might define custom macros that change text to bold, which would require understanding and expanding these macros to extract the bold text.\n\nThese are potential difficulties that might be encountered when parsing a LaTeX document to extract bold texts. To handle these challenges, the parser needs to be robust and possibly have some understanding of LaTeX syntax and semantics."
