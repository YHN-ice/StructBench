Nested Commands: Bold text might be nested within other commands or environments, for example, within an `\\item` in a list or inside a custom command or environment.\n\n2. Custom Commands: The document might define custom commands that internally use `\\textbf{}`. We would need to identify and handle such custom definitions.\n\n3. Comments: The LaTeX file may contain comments (lines starting with `%`) that include the string `\\textbf{}`. These should not be considered as they do not render in the final document.\n\n4. Alternate Bold Commands: LaTeX provides other ways to make text bold, such as `\\bfseries` or the older `\\bf` command, which could also be used to make text bold.\n\n5. Line Breaks: The argument for `\\textbf{}` might span multiple lines, which means simply looking for text within curly brackets on a single line might not be sufficient.\n\n6. Optional Arguments: There might be optional arguments included with the `\\textbf` command which needs to be handled correctly.\n\n7. Escaped Characters: If `\\textbf{}` appears with a backslash before it (e.g., `\\\\textbf{}`), it is not a command but escaped text meant to display as-is.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser needs to handle these scenarios properly.
