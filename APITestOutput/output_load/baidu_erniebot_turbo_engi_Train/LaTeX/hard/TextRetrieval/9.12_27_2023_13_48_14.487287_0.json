I will need to recognize all the possible commands that represent bold text in the document.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting commands, like italics or underlines. Parsing nested commands correctly to extract only the bold text can be complex.\n\n3. **Environment Blocks**: Bold text can also be included within different types of environment blocks like `figure`, `table`, or `itemize`. The parser should recognize text within these environments if it's marked as bold.\n\n4. **Comments and Preamble**: The LaTeX document might contain comments (using `%`) or a preamble with packages and settings that don't contribute to the actual document content. These should be ignored when extracting bold text.\n\n5. **Custom Commands**: There might be custom macros defined in the preamble that change text to bold. These would need to be identified and handled appropriately.\n\n6. **Line Breaks and Inline Braces**: The bold command might be broken over multiple lines, or braces could be used in the text for various reasons. This can complicate parsing and extracting the exact bold text.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, I will need to parse the LaTeX file, taking into account these potential issues and extract the raw texts that are marked as bold, then present them separated by `\\n`."
