This can make the extraction of the file name more complicated.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension when including a figure (e.g., `\\includegraphics{image.png}`), but often, they do not (e.g., `\\includegraphics{image}`). The actual file could have different extensions and LaTeX will default to what is available. Extracting just the base name without an extension might be necessary.\n\n4. **Figure Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command often includes options in square brackets before the file name (e.g., `\\includegraphics[width=3cm]{image}`). These options should not be confused with the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. An include command might be commented out and should not be counted as an included figure.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: In some LaTeX packages or user-defined commands, multiple figures could be included within a single command or environment.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Users may define their own commands or environments that wrap around standard figure inclusion commands, which would require understanding those custom definitions to extract the figure names properly. \n\nThese are just some potential obstacles that might be encountered; the actual difficulties would depend on the specific LaTeX code in question. Now you can share the LaTeX input so that I can proceed with extracting the figure file names."
