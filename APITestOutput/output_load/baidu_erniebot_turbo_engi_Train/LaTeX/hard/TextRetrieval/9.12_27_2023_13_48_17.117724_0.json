This requires careful parsing to avoid losing the bold formatting or extracting incorrect text.\n\n3. **Braces handling**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to enclose the text that should be formatted. It's possible for braces to be nested, which can complicate the extraction as one must match the correct opening and closing braces.\n\n4. **Custom commands and environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that set text to bold, necessitating an understanding of these custom definitions to correctly extract the bold text.\n\n5. **Comments and escaped characters**: The LaTeX file may contain comments (using `%`) that could include what looks like bold commands but should not be processed. Additionally, escaped characters (like `{\\textbf{\\%}}`) should be correctly interpreted.\n\n6. **Multiline bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which requires that the parser maintain state across line breaks.\n\n7. **Incomplete or malformed commands**: If the document has syntax errors or incomplete commands, it could make extraction challenging or result in incorrect outputs.\n\nIn order to provide the correct answer, I will need to carefully account for these potential difficulties while parsing the LaTeX file you provide."
