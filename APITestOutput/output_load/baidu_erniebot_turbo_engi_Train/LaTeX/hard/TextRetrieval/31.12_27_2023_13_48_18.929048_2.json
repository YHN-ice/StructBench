Multiple Commands: LaTeX has several commands to include figures, such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, and sometimes custom commands defined by the user. Identifying all possible commands that can include a figure is necessary.\n\n2. Command Variants: The `\\includegraphics` command could have variants with different options or wrapped inside other environments, like the `figure` environment or custom-defined environments.\n\n3. Comments: Figures included in comments should not be counted. LaTeX comments start with `%` and extend to the end of the line.\n\n4. File Extensions: Sometimes LaTeX file references include the file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`), and sometimes they do not. The parser must handle both cases correctly.\n\n5. File Paths: Figures can be located in different directories, so the parser should capture the entire file path, not just the filename.\n\n6. Multiple Figures in One Command: It's possible to include multiple figures within one command, especially when using sub-figures or custom commands that loop over files.\n\n7. Optional Arguments: LaTeX commands may have optional arguments in square brackets before the actual file path, which should be ignored while extracting the filenames.\n\n8. Non-standard Include Commands: If the document uses a non-standard way to include figures, such as a LaTeX package that defines its own commands or macros for including figures, these would need to be accounted for.\n\n9. Concatenation of File Name Parts: In some cases, the file name or path might be constructed dynamically using LaTeX macros or command concatenation, which can be challenging to parse correctly.\n\nNow that we've identified potential issues, please provide the LaTeX file content so I can parse it and extract the included figure files as requested."
