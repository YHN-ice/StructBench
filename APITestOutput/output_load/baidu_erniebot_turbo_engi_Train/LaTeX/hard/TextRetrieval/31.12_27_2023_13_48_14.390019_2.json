Multiple commands: Figures might be included using different commands, such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\include`, or custom commands defined by the user.\n\n2. Different syntax: The `\\includegraphics` command might have various options that could change the syntax, such as width, height, scale, etc., which can make parsing more challenging.\n\n3. Relative and absolute paths: Figures might be referenced using relative or absolute paths, and the file extension might be omitted if the LaTeX engine is configured to guess it.\n\n4. Multiple figures in one command: The LaTeX file might use commands that include multiple figures at once, which would require parsing out each filename individually.\n\n5. Commented-out code: Some figure inclusion commands might be commented out in the LaTeX source, so these should not be considered.\n\n6. Custom environments or macros: The document might define custom environments or macros that include figures indirectly, making them harder to detect without fully interpreting the LaTeX code.\n\n7. Multi-line commands: LaTeX commands can be broken over multiple lines for readability, which means the filename might not be on the same line as the `\\includegraphics` command.\n\n8. Nested files: The document could use `\\input` or `\\include` to bring in content from other files, meaning the figures might not be included in the main file directly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to parse the LaTeX file with an understanding of its syntax rules, potentially using regular expressions to robustly handle variations and edge cases. Now, please provide the LaTeX file so we can attempt to extract the figure filenames."
