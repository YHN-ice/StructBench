Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles when trying to extract figure file names from a LaTeX file:\n\n1. **Different commands**: LaTeX allows for including figures using various commands such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\epsfig`, or older commands like `\\psfig`. Each command might require different parsing logic.\n\n2. **File path variations**: The file paths for figures can be absolute or relative, and they can include various file extensions or even no extension at all. Some LaTeX compilers will automatically search for common image extensions if none is provided.\n\n3. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes, a single `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple files, especially if it's within a loop or a custom command defined by the user.\n\n4. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command often includes optional arguments that modify the appearance of the figure (like scale, width, height, angle, etc.). These are typically within square brackets before the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX file might be commented out with `%`. These lines should be ignored as they do not contribute to the final document.\n\n6. **Figure environments**: Figures might be included within different environments like `figure`, `subfigure`, `minipage`, etc. The parser needs to recognize these environments to accurately extract the file names.\n\n7. **Custom commands and macros**: A LaTeX document might define custom commands that abstract the inclusion of figures. These macros would need to be recognized and expanded to identify the figure files.\n\n8. **File names with spaces or special characters**: If file names contain spaces, special characters, or LaTeX reserved characters, they might be enclosed in curly braces which is another pattern to look for.\n\nPlease provide the input LaTeX file content, so that I may attempt to extract the figure file names for you."
