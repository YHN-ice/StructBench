Handling these variations to extract the correct filename might be challenging.\n\n3. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes a single command can include multiple figures, especially within a loop or using comma-separated filenames. Parsing such structures accurately would be essential.\n\n4. **Comments and Unused Lines**: Lines that are commented out with `%` should not be considered as they do not contribute to the final output of the LaTeX document.\n\n5. **Complex Environments**: Figures could be included inside complex environments like `figure`, `minipage`, or custom-defined macros which may require careful parsing to extract the filenames.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have optional arguments that could include additional settings for the figure. We need to ignore these settings and focus on the filename.\n\n7. **File Extensions**: LaTeX allows the inclusion of graphics without specifying the file extension. The parser must handle cases where file extensions are not explicitly given.\n\n8. **Graphics Packages**: Different graphics packages might have different syntaxes for including graphics, which could complicate the parsing process.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, I will be able to parse through it and extract the filenames of all included figure files taking these potential difficulties into account."
