Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. Nested commands: Bold text may have other formatting commands inside it. For example, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{important} text}` has emphasized text within bold text.\n\n2. Optional arguments: Some LaTeX commands can take optional arguments, which could be mistaken as part of the bold text if not handled properly.\n\n3. Custom commands: The document may define custom commands that internally use `\\textbf{}` to create bold text. These would need to be interpreted or expanded to extract the bold text.\n\n4. Comments: Bold text within comments should be ignored, as comments are not rendered in the final document. LaTeX comments start with `%`.\n\n5. Environments: There are environments such as `figure` or `table` that may contain formatting commands, but their interpretation might differ from the main text body.\n\n6. Multiple instances: There may be multiple instances of bold text on the same line or across the document, which should all be extracted.\n\n7. Line breaks and whitespace: Care must be taken to handle line breaks and excessive whitespace within the `\\textbf{}` command, as they can appear in the LaTeX source but do not affect the output.\n\n8. Encoded characters: Special characters in LaTeX may be encoded (e.g., `\\_` for an underscore), and these should be correctly interpreted when extracting text.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we need to ensure that the parser is robust enough to handle the LaTeX syntax's intricacies, such as by properly matching braces, ignoring comments, expanding custom commands if necessary, and respecting the structure of environments."
