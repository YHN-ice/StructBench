Some users might include the full file path, while others might include a relative path or just the file name. Additionally, the file extension might be omitted if the author wants LaTeX to automatically detect it.\n\n3. **Commented lines**: Figures might be commented out with a `%` symbol, and you would need to differentiate between active includes and those that are commented out.\n\n4. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes, LaTeX users include multiple figures in one command, for instance using the `\\subfigure` or `\\subfloat` commands within a single figure environment.\n\n5. **Custom macros**: Authors might define custom macros that internally use the `\\includegraphics` command, meaning you would need to recognize and resolve these macros to find out which files are included.\n\n6. **Graphics paths set by `\\graphicspath`**: If the document uses the `\\graphicspath` command, the actual file paths of included graphics will be different from those stated in the `\\includegraphics` command.\n\n7. **Figures included in external files**: Sometimes figures are included not directly in the main LaTeX file but in external files that are included with `\\input` or `\\include` commands.\n\nThese potential difficulties mean that extracting figure filenames from a LaTeX file may require not just simple text parsing but also an understanding of how LaTeX handles file inclusion and potentially some of the logic or macros used within a specific document."
