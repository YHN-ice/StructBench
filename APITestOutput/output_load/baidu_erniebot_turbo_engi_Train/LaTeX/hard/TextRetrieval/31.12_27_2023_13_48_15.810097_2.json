Some users may also use variables for paths which can complicate the extraction.\n\n3. **File extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files will include the file extension (e.g., .png, .jpg, .pdf), and sometimes they will not. The parser must handle both cases.\n\n4. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command may have optional arguments which could contain brackets, making it harder to parse. For instance: `\\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{image.png}`.\n\n5. **Commented out lines**: Lines that include the `\\includegraphics` command might be commented out with a `%`. These should not be considered when extracting figure file names.\n\n6. **Custom commands**: Some LaTeX documents define custom commands to include graphics which can obfuscate the actual file name.\n\n7. **Environment context**: Figures might be included within different environments (like `figure`, or `minipage`), so context needs to be understood to correctly parse them.\n\n8. **File name spaces**: Sometimes file names may contain spaces which are often represented by `~` or `\\space` in LaTeX. The parser needs to account for these representations.\n\n9. **Multiple files in one command**: In some cases, a command might include multiple files at once which need to be extracted individually.\n\n10. **Conditional inclusion**: Files might be included conditionally using LaTeX conditional constructs (e.g., `\\if`, `\\ifdef`, etc.), which complicates the parsing.\n\nGiven these potential issues, I would need to see the specific input file to accurately extract all included figure file names."
