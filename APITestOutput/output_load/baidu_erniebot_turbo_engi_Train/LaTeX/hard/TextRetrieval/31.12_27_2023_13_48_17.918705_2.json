Each of these commands might have different syntax and argument structures.\n\n2. **File path variations**: The path to the included files might be given in various forms, such as relative paths, absolute paths, or even using LaTeX variables for paths.\n\n3. **File extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX users omit the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command because LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type. This means we may have to infer the file type or search for multiple possible extensions.\n\n4. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that change its behavior or the appearance of the included graphic (e.g., scale, width, height). These optional arguments might complicate the parsing process.\n\n5. **Commented lines**: Some lines including figure files might be commented out using the `%` symbol. We need to ensure we are not extracting filenames from commented lines.\n\n6. **Environment contexts**: Figures could be included inside different LaTeX environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), which might affect the way we parse the document.\n\n7. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes, LaTeX users include multiple figures within a single command (e.g., using `\\foreach` or within a single `figure` environment). This could complicate extraction if not handled properly.\n\n8. **Custom commands or macros**: The document could define custom commands that internally use `\\includegraphics`. Detecting these would require parsing and understanding custom macros definitions.\n\nEach of these obstacles would require careful parsing logic to handle correctly."
