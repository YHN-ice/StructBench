The parser needs to handle such cases where the file name does not include an extension.\n\n4. **Commented lines**: Some lines in the LaTeX source might be commented out using the `%` sign, so the parser should ignore those lines.\n\n5. **Brace styles**: The file name in the `\\includegraphics` command can be enclosed within curly braces `{}` or square brackets `[]` for options. The parser must correctly discern the file name from any additional parameters or options.\n\n6. **Graphics paths**: LaTeX allows setting a graphics path where all figures are stored, which might or might not be used in conjunction with the `\\includegraphics` command.\n\n7. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes, a single `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple files for conditional compilation. The parser must handle this scenario as well.\n\n8. **Commands within commands**: File names might be generated by commands within the `\\includegraphics` command, making it hard to extract literal file names.\n\n9. **Environment usage**: Figures might be included within custom-defined environments or within LaTeX constructs like `minipage` which could complicate the parsing.\n\n10. **File name with spaces**: If a file name contains spaces, it could be wrapped in double quotes or use a backslash to escape spaces, which should be handled by the parser.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser must be robust enough to handle different cases and variations of how figures are included in a LaTeX document.
