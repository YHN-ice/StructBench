Comments in LaTeX are initiated by `%`.\n\n5. **Conditional text**: There could be conditional statements that may or may not render text as bold depending on certain conditions.\n\n6. **Custom environments**: If the LaTeX document defines custom environments that implicitly set text to be bold, those would need to be recognized and handled accordingly.\n\n7. **Braces within text**: If there are braces within the text meant to be bold, it can disrupt simple parsing methods because the braces are also used to delimit the scope of LaTeX commands.\n\n8. **Escaped characters**: Special characters that are part of LaTeX syntax might be escaped within the text and need to be interpreted correctly.\n\nIn order to correctly parse the LaTeX file and extract all bold texts, the parser must handle these potential issues properly."
