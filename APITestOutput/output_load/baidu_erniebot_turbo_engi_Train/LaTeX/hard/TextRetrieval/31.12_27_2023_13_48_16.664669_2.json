So, it's possible to find `\\includegraphics{figure1}` without an explicit file extension.\n\n4. **Options within the Command**: The `\\includegraphics` command can also include options within square brackets before the file name, which may alter the straightforward parsing of the file name.\n\n5. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX source may be commented out with `%`, which means that any `\\includegraphics` command within a comment should not be considered as an included figure.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Occasionally, LaTeX users may include multiple figures within one command (using subfigure packages or similar), which can complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Custom Commands**: Users might define custom commands that wrap around `\\includegraphics`, which would require identifying these new commands and parsing them accordingly.\n\nThese are some considerations to keep in mind when parsing a LaTeX file to extract included figure files. Once the input file is presented, these potential difficulties can be addressed more specifically."
