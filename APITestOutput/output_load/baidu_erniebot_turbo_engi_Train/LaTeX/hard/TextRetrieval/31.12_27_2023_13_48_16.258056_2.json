This means that filenames could be listed with or without extensions like `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, etc.\n\n4. **Commented Code**: Parts of a LaTeX document, including figure inclusions, might be commented out with `%` signs. These should not be counted as included figure files.\n\n5. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments for scaling, rotating, etc., which might complicate the extraction of the filename.\n\n6. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that wrap standard figure inclusion commands, which would require understanding these definitions to extract the filenames properly.\n\n7. **Handling Errors**: If the LaTeX file contains errors or non-standard syntax, it could lead to incorrect parsing results.\n\n8. **Multiple Inclusions on One Line**: Sometimes, multiple figures could be included on a single line, separated by commas or within a single command’s arguments.\n\nTo accurately extract all figure filenames, a parser will need to handle these complexities and ensure that only legitimate figure inclusion commands and their corresponding filenames are extracted."
