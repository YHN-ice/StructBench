Handling different path formats without errors is necessary to extract the correct file names.\n\n3. **File extensions**: LaTeX sometimes allows the omission of file extensions when including graphics. In such cases, it might be difficult to determine the exact file name if the extension is not explicitly provided in the LaTeX code.\n\n4. **Commented code**: Parts of the LaTeX document might be commented out, including figure inclusion commands. It's important to ignore commented lines to avoid extracting file names that are not actually used in the document.\n\n5. **Complex macros or definitions**: If the LaTeX document defines macros that include graphics, or if file names are generated by commands, extracting these names can be more complex than simply looking for `\\includegraphics` commands.\n\n6. **Conditional compilation**: Some documents use conditional compilation with commands like `\\if`, `\\ifdef`, or custom defined conditions. Depending on how these are used, some figures might only be included in certain builds of the document, adding complexity to parsing.\n\n7. **Scale and rotation options**: Figure inclusion commands might include options for scaling, rotating, or otherwise transforming the included graphics. These options should not affect the extraction of file names but need to be correctly parsed to avoid misinterpretation.\n\n8. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes multiple figures are included in a single command (for example, using `\\foreach` or in the arguments of other custom commands), which would require careful parsing to extract all relevant file names.\n\nTo address these challenges, an effective LaTeX file parser would need to be not only a simple string finder but also sensitive to the context and able to handle the LaTeX syntax properly."
