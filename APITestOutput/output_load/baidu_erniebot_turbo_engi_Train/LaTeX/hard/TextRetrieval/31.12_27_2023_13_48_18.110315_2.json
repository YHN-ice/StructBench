The parser must recognize files both with and without extensions.\n4. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional parameters that change the image appearance but are irrelevant for extracting the filename.\n5. **Commented Lines**: Some lines with figure inclusion commands may be commented out with `%`, and these should not be processed to extract filenames.\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, LaTeX allows for including multiple figures within one command or environment (e.g., subfigures), which could complicate extraction.\n7. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document might define its own commands or environments that wrap standard LaTeX figure commands, requiring recognition of these custom macros.\n\nTo correctly extract all figures' filenames, the parser must handle all these cases and potentially more, depending on the complexity of the LaTeX source code provided.
