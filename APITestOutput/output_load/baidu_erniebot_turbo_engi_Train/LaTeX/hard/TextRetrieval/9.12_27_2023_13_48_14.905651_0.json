Identifying all possible variations is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands, such as italic (`\\textit{}`), underline (`\\underline{}`), or within environments like lists, tables, etc. The parser needs to correctly handle nested cases.\n\n3. **Braces and Argument Handling**: LaTeX uses braces (`{}`) to delimit the arguments of commands. Matching these braces, especially in complex documents with many nested elements, is non-trivial and essential for correct extraction.\n\n4. **Custom macros**: If the document defines custom macros that wrap the `\\textbf{}` command or even redefine it, the parser must understand these to correctly identify bold text.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX comments (anything following a `%` until the end of the line) might include what appears to be bold commands, which should not be processed.\n\n6. **Line breaks and white spaces**: Text formatting in the LaTeX source might include line breaks and white spaces that are not relevant to the actual content but could interfere with simple text extraction methods.\n\n7. **Environments and groups**: LaTeX's scoping rules mean that text could be made bold by being inside a scope that has `\\bfseries` or similar commands applied. This could occur without the explicit `\\textbf{}` command around the text.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, a parser must be carefully designed to handle the complexities of LaTeX syntax accurately.
