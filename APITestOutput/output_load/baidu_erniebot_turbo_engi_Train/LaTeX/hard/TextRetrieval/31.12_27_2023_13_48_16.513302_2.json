Typically, graphics are included in LaTeX documents using the `\\includegraphics` command from the `graphicx` package.\n\nSome potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process include:\n\n1. **Variations in Commands**: LaTeX provides different commands and environments to include figures, like `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, and the `figure` environment. Each has its syntax and options that can affect parsing.\n\n2. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: The file paths provided to the include commands can be either relative to the LaTeX document or absolute paths. This means that the parser has to be able to handle both types of paths.\n\n3. **Option Parameters**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have optional parameters that specify the width, height, rotation, and other attributes of the figure. These parameters could come before the file name, so the parser should ignore them and find the actual file name.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX include commands specify a file with its extension (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`), but other times the extension is omitted because LaTeX can automatically determine which file to use based on what is available. The parser should be ready to handle both cases.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments in the document using `%`. If a line including a figure is commented out, it should not be considered by the parser.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Some LaTeX commands allow for including multiple figures at once (e.g., subfigures or using a loop), which might require special handling during parsing.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Users can define their own commands and environments in LaTeX, which could encapsulate the `\\includegraphics` command. The parser would need to recognize these custom commands as well.\n\n8. **File Name with Spaces or Special Characters**: File names might contain spaces or special characters which are handled differently in LaTeX, often requiring special treatment (e.g., using `\\ ` for spaces).\n\nThe parser must correctly navigate all of these challenges to accurately extract all figure file names from the LaTeX document."
