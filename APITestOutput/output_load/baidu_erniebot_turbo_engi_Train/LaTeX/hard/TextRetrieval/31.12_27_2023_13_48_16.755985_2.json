They might be relative or absolute paths, and they could include directory separators that are specific to operating systems.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX commands might include the file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`), while others might omit it, relying on LaTeX to find the correct file type.\n\n4. **Commented Lines**: Some lines in the LaTeX file might be commented out using the `%` character. These lines should not be considered when extracting figure filenames.\n\n5. **Complex File Names**: File names can contain spaces, underscores, hyphens, or other special characters, and handling these correctly can be tricky.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command and similar commands can have optional arguments that modify the behavior of the command but are not part of the file name.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple files, especially in the case of subfigures or when using loops or macros to include graphics.\n\n8. **Custom Commands or Environments**: A LaTeX document might define custom commands or environments that wrap standard include commands, which would require additional logic to unwrap and extract the file names.\n\nTo correctly extract the figure filenames, we will need to identify the correct commands used for including figures, handle all variations in file paths and extensions, ignore commented lines and optional arguments, and handle any custom commands or environments that may affect how figures are included."
