You'll need to correctly identify the beginning and end of the text intended to be bold, which could be complicated if there are additional curly braces inside the bold command for other purposes.\n\n4. **Custom Macros and Environments**: If the LaTeX document defines custom macros or environments that change text to bold, you would need to recognize these as well in order to extract the bold text correctly.\n\n5. **Comments and Inactive Blocks**: Bold text within comments (anything after `%` on a line) or inactive blocks should not be considered, since they don't affect the final output.\n\n6. **Complex Structures**: Bold text might appear within more complex structures like equations, figures, or custom-defined blocks that require more sophisticated parsing logic.\n\n7. **Broken Syntax**: Incomplete or incorrectly used LaTeX commands for bold text may lead to parsing errors if not handled gracefully.\n\nAssuming that your capabilities are limited to parsing and interpreting input as a LaTeX parser and not executing or compiling the LaTeX code itself, you would need to carefully handle the above challenges to successfully extract all instances of bold text from the provided LaTeX file content."
