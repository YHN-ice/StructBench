This needs to be handled correctly to extract only the text content.\n\n2. **Line breaks and whitespace**: LaTeX is flexible with line breaks and whitespace, which means that the bold command may be split across lines or contain significant whitespace that needs to be considered when extracting the text.\n\n3. **Special characters**: LaTeX uses special characters like `{}`, `&`, `%`, etc., which could be present within the bold text and need to be interpreted or stripped out correctly.\n\n4. **Multiple instances**: There might be multiple instances of bold text throughout the document. All instances need to be found and extracted.\n\n5. **Environment conflicts**: Bold text might be inside various environments, like equations, figures, or tables, and these environments might alter how text should be extracted or formatted.\n\n6. **Comments**: The LaTeX file could contain comments (lines starting with `%`) that might include the `\\textbf{}` command, but should not be included in the output since they are not actually rendered in the final document.\n\n7. **Custom macros**: The file might define custom macros that internally use `\\textbf{}`. These cases can complicate extraction because one would need to understand the macro's expansion to extract the text properly.\n\nTo give an accurate answer, the parser must handle these potential difficulties and correctly extract only the content that is intended to be displayed in bold in the final document."
