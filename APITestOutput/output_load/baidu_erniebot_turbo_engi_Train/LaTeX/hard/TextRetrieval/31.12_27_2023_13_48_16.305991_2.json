Furthermore, LaTeX may omit the file extension, which may require inference based on common graphic file extensions (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.eps`).\n\n3. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command and others can have optional arguments that must be correctly parsed to isolate the file name (e.g., `\\includegraphics[width=3cm]{image.png}`).\n\n4. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures, especially in the case of subfigures or when figures are included within a loop or macro.\n\n5. **Commented code**: Parts of the LaTeX document including figure inclusion commands might be commented out, so these should not be considered as actual included figures.\n\n6. **Custom commands and environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that internally include graphics, making it harder to spot without fully parsing and understanding the user-defined macros.\n\n7. **Environment encapsulation**: Figure inclusion might happen inside various environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), which doesn't change the inclusion itself but might affect how easy it is to spot.\n\n8. **Graphics package options**: If the document uses specific graphics packages with options that change the behavior of how files are included, this may affect the file names and paths.\n\nEach of these potential issues requires careful consideration when developing a robust LaTeX file parser for extracting figure file names."
