Different Commands: LaTeX provides multiple commands to include graphics (e.g., `\\includegraphics`, `\\pgfimage`, etc.), and each command might have different syntax or options.\n\n2. Command Options: The `\\includegraphics` command often comes with options that might complicate parsing, such as scaling, rotation, or other effects. We'll need to correctly ignore these options to extract the file name.\n\n3. Relative and Absolute Paths: The paths of the included files might be relative to the LaTeX file's directory, absolute on the filesystem, or even use variables for paths.\n\n4. File Extensions: LaTeX does not require the file extension when including an image, so the parser must handle cases where the extension is missing.\n\n5. Comments: The LaTeX comments (`%`) can contain commented-out commands or options that should be ignored.\n\n6. Multiple Figures in One Command: Sometimes a single `\\includegraphics` command may include multiple files, especially when used inside a `figure` environment with subfigures.\n\n7. Environment Wrappers: Figures might be included within different environments (`figure`, `minipage`, etc.), which could affect how the include command is used.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser will have to be robust enough to handle various syntaxes and LaTeX idioms. We need to carefully consider these factors when writing our parsing logic or using a parsing library capable of handling LaTeX files. Now you may provide the input LaTeX file for me to parse and extract the figure file names."
