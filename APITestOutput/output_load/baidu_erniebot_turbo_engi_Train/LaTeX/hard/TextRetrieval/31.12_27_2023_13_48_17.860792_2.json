If paths are included, they could be absolute or relative, and parsing may need to account for different directory separators (e.g., forward vs. backward slashes).\n\n3. **File extensions**: The LaTeX command for including graphics, `\\includegraphics`, does not require the file extension, so the filename might appear with or without an extension in the document.\n\n4. **Option parameters**: The `\\includegraphics` command might include optional parameters inside square brackets before the filename, which need to be ignored while parsing filenames.\n\n5. **Environment encapsulation**: Figures may be included inside environments such as `figure` or `minipage`, which could have additional text or commands that are not related to the file inclusion itself.\n\n6. **Command variations**: Users might define their own commands that internally use `\\includegraphics` or other include commands, leading to non-standard syntaxes that need to be interpreted.\n\n7. **Comments**: Some figures might be commented out in the LaTeX source. These should likely be excluded from the output unless specified otherwise.\n\n8. **Multiple files in one command**: Sometimes `\\includegraphics` allows including multiple files in one command, separated by commas.\n\n9. **File names with spaces or special characters**: Figure filenames may contain spaces or special characters that are handled differently in LaTeX, such as underscores, which might require proper parsing or handling.\n\nConsidering these potential issues, we would need to implement a robust parsing mechanism to accurately extract figure filenames from the LaTeX source code. Now you can provide the LaTeX file content, and I can attempt to parse it and extract the figure filenames for you."
