The parser should recognize all possible commands used for including images.\n\n2. **Command Variations**: Even within `\\includegraphics`, there are options and variations (e.g., `\\includegraphics[options]{filename}`), and the parser must be able to handle these cases correctly.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Figure files may come with or without file extensions in the LaTeX document. The parser needs to be prepared to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Path Specification**: Images may be stored in different directories, and the file paths may be specified relative to the main .tex file or using absolute paths. The parser must extract the filename irrespective of the path.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` character. An image command might be commented out, and in such a case, it should not be considered.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: The `subfigure` or `subcaption` packages allow for multiple figures within one figure environment. The parser needs to distinguish between them.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Macros**: A LaTeX document may define custom commands or macros that internally use `\\includegraphics`. These would need to be resolved to extract the actual filename.\n\n8. **Environment-Based Inclusions**: Figures might be included within different environments (e.g., `figure`, `minipage`), and the parser must be able to extract file names irrespective of their surrounding environments.\n\n9. **File Name Spaces**: If a filename contains spaces, it might be enclosed in double braces (`{{filename with space}}`). The parser should correctly handle such cases.\n\n10. **Nested Commands**: Sometimes, file names could be generated using other LaTeX commands, which might require an understanding of how those commands modify the resulting string.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, we will need to carefully parse the LaTeX file you provide, considering these factors, to correctly extract all included figure files."
