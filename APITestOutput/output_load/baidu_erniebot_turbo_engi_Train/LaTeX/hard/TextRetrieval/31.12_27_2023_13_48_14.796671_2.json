The parser needs to handle both.\n\n4. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command and others could have optional arguments that affect the file name; these need to be correctly parsed to not confuse them with the file name.\n\n5. **Commented out lines**: Lines that are commented out with `%` should not be considered, as they do not actually include a figure in the final document.\n\n6. **Command redefinition**: LaTeX allows users to redefine commands, so potential custom commands could be used to include graphics.\n\n7. **Multiple figures in one command**: A single command might include multiple figures, especially within figure environments or custom commands/macros.\n\n8. **File names with spaces or special characters**: If a file name contains spaces or special characters, it may be enclosed in double quotes or otherwise formatted in a way that requires special handling.\n\nAddressing these issues would require a sophisticated parsing approach to accurately extract all included figure files from a LaTeX document."
