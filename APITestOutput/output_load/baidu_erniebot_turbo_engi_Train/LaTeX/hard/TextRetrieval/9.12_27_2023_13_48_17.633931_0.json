Different Commands: Bold text in LaTeX can be generated using different commands or environments, such as `\\textbf{...}`, `{\\bfseries ...}`, or within a `\\bf` environment. Each of these must be handled correctly.\n\n2. Nested Commands: LaTeX allows for nested commands, so bold text might contain other formatting commands inside it, which should not affect the extraction but should be handled correctly (e.g., `\\textbf{Some \\emph{emphasized} text}`).\n\n3. Escaped Characters: In LaTeX, certain characters are escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\%`, `\\\\`, `\\{`, `\\}`). In the process of extracting text, it's important to consider whether these characters should be output as-is or unescaped.\n\n4. Comments: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. Any content following this symbol on a line is a comment and should be ignored in the extraction process.\n\n5. Environment Contents: Bold text could be inside a custom environment or one that changes text formatting globally. These cases might require environment-specific parsing logic.\n\n6. Multiple Bold Sections: There might be multiple bold sections within the file that need to be extracted separately.\n\n7. Line Breaks and Whitespace: LaTeX is quite flexible with line breaks and white spaces, which might not be reflected in the visual output but need to be handled in the text extraction process.\n\n8. Fragmented Text: The text within a bold command might be broken across lines or separated by LaTeX commands, making it difficult to extract cleanly without additional processing.\n\nAddressing these complexities requires careful parsing and potentially some decision-making about how to handle ambiguous cases."
