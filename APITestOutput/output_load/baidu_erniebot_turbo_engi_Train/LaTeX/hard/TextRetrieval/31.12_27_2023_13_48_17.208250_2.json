These variations need to be handled to extract the file names correctly.\n\n3. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that specify the width, height, scale, etc., which must be distinguished from the file name itself.\n\n4. **Commented Lines**: Sometimes, commands may be commented out using `%`. These lines should not be considered when extracting figure file names.\n\n5. **Grouping and Braces**: LaTeX uses `{}` for mandatory arguments and `[]` for optional arguments. Nested braces or brackets need to be parsed correctly to get the actual file names.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: LaTeX allows for including multiple figures within one command using subfigure packages. This may require additional parsing logic to extract all individual file names.\n\nOnce you present the LaTeX input file, I will parse it while considering these potential difficulties to accurately extract all included figure file names."
