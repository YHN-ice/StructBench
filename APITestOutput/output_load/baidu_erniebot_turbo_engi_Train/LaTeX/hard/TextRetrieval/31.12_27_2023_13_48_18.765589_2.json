The parser must handle both cases and extract the file name correctly.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX users include the file extension in the command, and sometimes they don't (because LaTeX can guess the right one based on what is available). The parser has to account for both scenarios.\n\n4. **File Names with Spaces**: If file names contain spaces or special characters, they are often enclosed in curly braces. The parser needs to correctly identify the file name within these braces.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol, and anything following this symbol on a line is ignored by LaTeX. However, a naive parser might incorrectly interpret commented file names as actual inclusions.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: It is possible to include multiple figures within one command (e.g., using subfigure environments). The parser should be able to extract all file names.\n\n7. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Some documents define custom commands or environments that wrap around the standard figure inclusion commands, complicating the extraction process.\n\n8. **Command Options**: LaTeX allows for optional arguments in square brackets before the mandatory arguments. The parser must ignore these options to correctly extract the file name.\n\n9. **Command on Multiple Lines**: Sometimes commands are broken up across multiple lines, which can make it harder to correctly identify the parts pertaining to the figure file name.\n\n10. **Reuse and Macros**: A filename could be defined as a macro elsewhere in the document and then used within an include command, making it necessary to resolve macros to get the actual file name.\n\nPlease provide the LaTeX file content so that I can attempt to extract the included figure files."
