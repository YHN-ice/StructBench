These need to be recognized and handled.\n   \n2. **Nested Commands:** Bold text commands could be nested within other commands or environments, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Comments and Inactive Code:** The LaTeX file might contain comments (using `%`) or inactive code that includes bold commands which should not be extracted as they are not actually used to format text in the final document.\n\n4. **Custom Environments:** If the LaTeX file has custom environments that change text to bold, it would require understanding these environments to extract the bold text correctly.\n\n5. **Brace Matching:** Since LaTeX uses braces `{}` for command arguments, correctly matching opening and closing braces is essential to accurately extract the bold text content.\n\n6. **Multiline Text:** Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser needs to handle line breaks and concatenate lines properly to extract the entire bold text.\n\n7. **Special Characters:** Special characters or commands within the bold text might need proper handling to ensure they do not interfere with parsing (e.g., `\\{`, `\\}`, `\\\\`, etc.).\n\n8. **Multiple Instances:** There could be multiple instances of bold text throughout the document, and all instances must be found and extracted.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, we can aim to extract all bold texts from the given LaTeX file accurately."
