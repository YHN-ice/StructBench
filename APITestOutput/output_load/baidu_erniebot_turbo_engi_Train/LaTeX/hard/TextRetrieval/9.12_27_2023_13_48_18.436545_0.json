Identifying all possible ways that bold text can be represented is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text commands can be nested within other formatting commands or environments, making it tricky to extract only the bold text without including other formatting.\n\n3. **Comments and escape characters**: Comments (using `%`) might contain bold text commands which should not be extracted as they are not rendered in the final document. Also, special LaTeX characters might be escaped (like `\\_`) which need to be handled properly.\n\n4. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text in LaTeX might span multiple lines or even paragraphs. Proper parsing should handle these cases, considering LaTeX's flexibility with whitespace and line breaks.\n\n5. **Custom and complex environments**: Bold text could be inside custom-defined environments or within complex environments (like tables, figures, itemize lists, etc.), necessitating more advanced parsing logic to correctly extract the content.\n\n6. **Conditional text**: Sometimes, LaTeX documents might have conditional statements that only render bold text if certain conditions are met (e.g., using `\\if... \\fi` constructs). It could complicate the parsing depending on whether these conditions need to be evaluated or not.\n\nTo properly address these challenges, the parser would have to be quite sophisticated, being able to interpret the context of LaTeX commands, handle nested structures, and understand custom definitions and environments."
