The presence of additional braces within this text (for nesting or other purposes) may complicate the parsing.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Text that appears to be formatted as bold may be commented out using the `%` symbol or may be part of inactive code blocks, such as within a `\\iffalse ... \\fi` construct.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Malformed Commands**: If the LaTeX file contains syntax errors, such as missing closing braces for the `\\textbf` command, this could cause incorrect parsing of the bold text.\n\n6. **Multi-line Bold Text**: The bold text might span across multiple lines or even pages, which would require handling line breaks and potentially page breaks correctly.\n\n7. **Custom Styles or Class Files**: The LaTeX file might use custom styles or class files that define bold text in a non-standard way, which would require additional logic to identify.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser would need to handle these potential issues effectively while traversing the LaTeX code."
