Furthermore, conditional text that's not active in the final document (e.g., within `\\iffalse ... \\fi`) should also be ignored.\n\n5. **Escaped characters**: Special characters that are escaped (e.g., `\\%`) should be treated correctly and not as the start of a comment or command.\n\n6. **Complex environments**: Some LaTeX environments like `tabular` or `figure` can have different formatting rules, and extracting text from them could require additional considerations.\n\n7. **Line breaks and white spaces**: In LaTeX, line breaks and white spaces are handled differently than in plain text, and we need to account for these when extracting the text to ensure it maintains its intended formatting.\n\nThese potential issues will require careful parsing and possibly a context-sensitive approach to ensure accurate extraction of only the bold texts from the LaTeX file."
