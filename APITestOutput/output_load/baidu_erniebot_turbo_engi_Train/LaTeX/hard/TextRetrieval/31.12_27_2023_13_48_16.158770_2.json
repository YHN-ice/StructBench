It is important to extract the correct file name regardless of the path included in the LaTeX code.\n\n4. **File extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension when including graphics (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf), but other times they do not. The parser must be able to handle both cases.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX comments, starting with '%', may contain lines that look like figure inclusion commands but are actually commented out and should not be considered.\n\n6. **File names with spaces or special characters**: File names can include spaces or special characters, which can complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. **Multiple figures in one command**: LaTeX allows for multiple figures to be included in a single command (for example, using \\foreach or by putting multiple file names separated by commas).\n\n8. **Environment variations**: The figure files might not be directly included with \\includegraphics but might be part of other environments or new commands defined by the user that internally use \\includegraphics.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust LaTeX file parser needs to:\n- Correctly identify all commands and environments used for including figures.\n- Handle optional arguments without getting confused about the file name.\n- Extract the correct file name regardless of whether the path is absolute or relative.\n- Properly ignore commented out lines.\n- Deal with special characters and spaces in file names.\n- Handle multiple files in one command if applicable.\n- Be aware of custom commands or environments defined by the user that might include graphics indirectly.\n\nOnce these challenges are addressed, the parser can then reliably extract all figure file names from a LaTeX document."
