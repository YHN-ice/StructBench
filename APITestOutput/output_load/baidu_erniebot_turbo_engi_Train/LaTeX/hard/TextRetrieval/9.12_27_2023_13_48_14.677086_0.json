The parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Custom environments and macros**: The document might define custom commands or environments that change the default behavior of bold commands or encapsulate text within a bold context.\n\n5. **Comments**: The LaTeX file might contain comments that include the syntax for bold text, but since they are comments, they should not be considered as actual content.\n\n6. **Text formatting across lines**: Bold commands might span multiple lines, which can complicate the parsing process if the parser expects commands to be contained within a single line.\n\n7. **Braces balancing**: Correctly identifying the closing brace for a command in the presence of nested braces or other LaTeX constructs is important to ensure accurate extraction of text.\n\nIt's important to address these potential issues to accurately parse and extract bold text from a LaTeX document."
