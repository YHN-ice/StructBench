Comments: Figures included in comments (lines starting with %) should not be considered as actual inclusions.\n\n5. Conditional inclusion: Figures may be included conditionally using LaTeX's conditional structures (e.g., \\if, \\ifdef, \\ifx). The parser needs to evaluate these conditions to determine if a figure is really included.\n\n6. Custom commands or environments: A document might define custom commands or environments that internally include figures. These would require the parser to understand such custom definitions.\n\n7.
