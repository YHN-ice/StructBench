The parser must recognize all these commands.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text in LaTeX could be nested within other commands or environments, which might affect the parsing logic. For example, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{important} text}` has emphasis inside bold text.\n\n3. **Custom commands**: A LaTeX document might define custom commands that result in bold text. The parser must be able to interpret these custom definitions to extract bold texts correctly.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. If bold text appears within a comment, it should not be extracted as it is not part of the compiled document.\n\n5. **Brace matching**: LaTeX commands use curly braces `{}` to encapsulate the scope of the command's effect. The parser must correctly handle nested braces and ignore braces used within text (e.g., by escaping them or within a verbatim environment).\n\n6. **Escape characters**: Special characters in LaTeX are often escaped with a backslash (`\\`). The parser needs to interpret these escape characters correctly to determine if they are part of a command or represent a special character in the text.\n\n7. **Environment-specific rules**: Different environments (like `equation`, `itemize`, etc.) might have specific rules regarding formatting. The parser needs to be aware of these environments while extracting text.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a comprehensive understanding of the LaTeX syntax and careful implementation of the parsing logic."
