Additionally, escaped characters (like `\\%` for a literal percent sign) should be handled correctly.\n\n5. **Braces Handling**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to enclose arguments to commands. When extracting text, it's important to handle these correctly, especially if they are nested.\n\n6. **Custom Macros**: The document might define custom macros that change text to bold, making it necessary to understand or expand those macros to extract the text correctly.\n\n7. **Conditional Formatting**: There might be conditional statements that switch formatting based on certain conditions—these would need to be evaluated to determine if the text is indeed bold.\n\n8. **Parsing Incomplete or Incorrect LaTeX Syntax**: If the LaTeX file is not well-formed or contains syntax errors, it could cause issues with parsing.\n\n9. **Multi-file Documents**: Some LaTeX projects are split into multiple files using `\\input` or `\\include` commands. If that's the case, all relevant files would need to be parsed to find all instances of bold text.\n\n10. **Encoding**: The encoding of the file could potentially cause issues if not properly handled, especially with special characters or non-ASCII text.\n\nGiven these potential issues, it will be important to approach the task with a clear strategy and possibly use a robust LaTeX parsing library or carefully crafted regex patterns to accurately extract bold text from the document."
