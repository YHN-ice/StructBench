We need to identify all possible commands used in the input file to successfully extract all bold texts.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be within other formatting commands. For instance, you might have italicized text within bold text like `\\textbf{\\textit{...}}`. Parsing these nested commands correctly to only extract the bold text can be tricky.\n\n3. **Environment-based formatting**: Bold formatting might be applied through environments, like `\\begin{bfseries}...\\end{bfseries}`, which could encompass multiple lines or paragraphs. These cases require identifying the start and end of such environments.\n\n4. **Inline braces and special characters**: Braces `{}` are used in LaTeX for grouping but can also be part of the text if escaped properly. Special characters like `%`, `$`, `&`, etc., can affect parsing if not handled correctly.\n\n5. **Comments and non-printable content**: Comments (after `%`) should be ignored, as they are not part of the final output. Additionally, we need to ignore content that is meant for configuration or setup purposes, like `\\usepackage{}` statements, which do not contribute to the actual text content.\n\n6. **Custom commands and macros**: The LaTeX file might contain user-defined macros or commands that alter text formatting. These would need to be interpreted correctly to ensure that bold text resulting from these macros is included.\n\nThese are some of the potential obstacles that would need to be addressed when parsing a LaTeX file for bold text content."
