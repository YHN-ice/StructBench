We need to ensure that we recognize all the variants used for including figures.\n\n2. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options that change the behavior of the command. These options might be enclosed in square brackets `[]` before the file name. Parsing needs to account for these and not confuse them with file names.\n\n3. **File Path Complexity**: File names might include relative or absolute paths, special characters, or spaces. They may also omit file extensions, which is allowed in LaTeX if the extension is among default recognized image formats.\n\n4. **Comments**: Figures included in comments should not be counted. LaTeX comments begin with `%`. A figure inclusion command following `%` should not be considered.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: There might be multiple commands to include figures within a single line. Each case should be handled separately.\n\n6. **Environment Consideration**: Figures could be included inside different environments like `figure`, `minipage`, etc. The parser should work regardless of the environment.\n\n7. **File Extension Variations**: LaTeX is capable of working with different graphic formats, and sometimes the file extension might not be included in the LaTeX source code.\n\n8. **Custom Commands**: Sometimes users define custom commands in the preamble for including figures, which could alter the standard syntax for figure inclusion.\n\n9. **Concatenated File Names**: Rarely, file names might be constructed using LaTeX macros or concatenation, making simple parsing strategies insufficient.\n\nOnce we see the input LaTeX file, we will need to address these obstacles to extract all included figure filenames correctly."
