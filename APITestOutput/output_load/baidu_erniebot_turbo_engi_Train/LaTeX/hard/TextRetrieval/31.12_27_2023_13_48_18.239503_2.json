The parser must recognize all possible commands used to include figures.\n\n2. **File Paths**: The file path of the included figures can be absolute, relative, or even nested within directories. The parser needs to correctly identify and output the file path as it appears in the LaTeX code.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include graphics without specifying the file extension, relying on the LaTeX compiler to find the correct one. The parser needs to decide whether to output just the file name or to make assumptions about common extensions.\n\n4. **Comments**: Figures might be commented out in the LaTeX source code. The parser should ignore figures that are not actually included in the final document due to being commented out.\n\n5. **Complex Environments**: Figures might be included within more complex environments or custom commands defined earlier in the document, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have optional arguments that need to be processed or ignored, such as scaling or rotation options.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures per Line**: There might be lines that include multiple figures or figures included within a macro or loop, which could make parsing more challenging.\n\n8. **File Name Special Characters**: Sometimes filenames can contain special characters that need proper handling, such as spaces or underscores.\n\nTo provide accurate answers, the parser must navigate these complexities effectively."
