Each might have a slightly different syntax for including images.\n   \n2. **Different Commands**: While `\\includegraphics` is the most common command to include images, users might define their own commands or wrappers around this command.\n\n3. **Various Include Syntaxes**: The `\\includegraphics` command can be used with various options and syntax styles. For example, the image filename can be included with or without the file extension, within braces or brackets, or with additional parameters that affect the rendering.\n\n4. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX file might be commented out, including lines that seem to include graphics. The parser should ignore any lines that are commented out.\n\n5. **Multiple Files**: The figures might not be included in the main LaTeX file but in files that are included into the main file via `\\input` or `\\include`. Without access to these files, it might not be possible to extract all figure filenames.\n\n6. **Path Complexity**: Figures could be included from different directories, so the parser needs to handle paths correctly.\n\n7. **Figure Environment and Other Environments**: Figures could be wrapped within a `figure` environment or other LaTeX environments. This adds complexity to the parsing as it may need to understand the context to extract filenames accurately.\n\n8. **Conditional Inclusion**: Figures might be included conditionally using LaTeX if-conditions, making it more challenging to determine which figures are actually included when processing the file statically without compiling it.\n\n9. **Custom Commands or Classes**: Some LaTeX documents may define custom commands for including figures or use a custom document class which changes the standard behavior of figure inclusion commands.\n\nThe parser needs to handle all these possibilities to correctly extract the filenames of all included figure files."
