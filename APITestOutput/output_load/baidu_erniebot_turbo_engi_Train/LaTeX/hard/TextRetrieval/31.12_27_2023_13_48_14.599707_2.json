Each of these commands may have different syntax for specifying the file name.\n\n2. **File paths:** The file names can be specified with or without a path, and the path can be relative or absolute. Moreover, LaTeX might be set up to use a certain graphics path by default, meaning that the actual path to the image might not be explicitly written in the document.\n\n3. **File extensions:** Sometimes, LaTeX files specify graphics without a file extension. LaTeX is often configured to search for various image types (like .png, .jpg, .eps) if no extension is specified.\n\n4. **Multiple figures in one command:** The `\\includegraphics` command may be used inside a figure environment or other environments (like `minipage` or `figure*`) which can include multiple images.\n\n5. **Comments:** Any line or text that is commented out with `%` should not be considered when extracting figure file names.\n\n6. **Optional arguments:** The `\\includegraphics` command can contain optional arguments for scaling, rotating, etc., which could complicate the parsing as the file name is not always the first argument after the command.\n\n7. **Figures included within macros or custom commands:** If a LaTeX document defines custom commands or macros that wrap the `\\includegraphics` command, this might hide the direct usage of the include command and complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. **Figures included in external files:** Sometimes figures are included not directly in the main LaTeX document but in external files brought into the document with `\\input` or `\\include`.\n\n9. **Conditional inclusion:** There might be conditional statements (like `\\ifpdf`, `\\ifeq`, etc.) that determine whether a figure is included or not, depending on certain conditions which can't be evaluated without a full LaTeX engine.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, it's important to clarify some assumptions about how figures are included in the LaTeX file you will provide. For instance, we may need to know if we're only looking for standard `\\includegraphics` commands or if we should account for other ways figures may be included in the document."
