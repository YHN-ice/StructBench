This means we need to account for all possible ways bold text might be indicated.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text in LaTeX may contain other formatting commands or even nested bold commands. We have to handle these nested structures correctly to extract only the relevant text.\n\n3. **Escape Characters**: In LaTeX, certain characters are escaped with a backslash. When extracting text, we need to consider whether these characters should remain escaped or be converted to their literal representations.\n\n4. **Environment Context**: Bold text might be within different environments (like `figure`, `table`, etc.), which could affect how it's parsed.\n\n5. **Custom Macros**: If the LaTeX file contains custom macros or styles that define bold text, we would need to parse and understand these as well.\n\n6. **Comments and Inactive Code**: LaTeX comments (using `%`) or code that is not active (e.g., within `\\iffalse ... \\fi` constructs) might contain bold commands that are not actually used in the final document. We must differentiate between active and commented or inactive code.\n\n7. **Brace Matching**: Since LaTeX uses braces `{}` for command arguments and scope, accurately matching opening and closing braces is essential for correctly extracting the content.\n\n8. **Incomplete Commands**: If the LaTeX file is incomplete or has syntax errors related to bold commands, this might complicate or prevent accurate extraction of bold text.\n\nAddressing these difficulties will require careful consideration of the LaTeX syntax and potentially complex parsing logic to ensure accurate extraction of all bold texts."
