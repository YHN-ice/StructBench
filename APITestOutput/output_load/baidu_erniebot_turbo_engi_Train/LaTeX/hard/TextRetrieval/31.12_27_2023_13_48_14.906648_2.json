The parser must correctly extract the file name regardless of the path complexity.\n\n3. **Figure options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options specified in square brackets before the file name, such as `[width=0.5\\textwidth, height=5cm]`. The parser must ignore these options and only extract the file name.\n\n4. **File extensions**: Some LaTeX documents may omit the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command (e.g., `\\includegraphics{image}` instead of `\\includegraphics{image.png}`). The parser may need to account for this and still recognize the file name without an extension.\n\n5. **Curly braces and nested commands**: LaTeX uses curly braces for command parameters, and sometimes commands can be nested inside these parameters. The parser must properly handle nested commands and braces to accurately extract file names.\n\n6. **Commented lines**: The LaTeX file may contain comments, which are lines starting with `%`. If a figure command is commented out, it should not be considered by the parser.\n\n7. **Multiple files in one command**: Sometimes, a single `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple files separated by commas. The parser should split these correctly and list each file separately.\n\n8. **Custom commands or environments**: A LaTeX document might define custom commands or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics` but are not directly visible in the command structure that the parser is looking for.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the parser needs to be designed with a robust understanding of LaTeX syntax and potentially utilize regular expressions or a context-aware parsing algorithm to accurately identify and extract figure file names."
