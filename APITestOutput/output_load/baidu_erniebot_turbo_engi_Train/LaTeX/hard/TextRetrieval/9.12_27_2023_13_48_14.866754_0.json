The parser needs to recognize all these possible ways.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Sometimes, bold commands can be nested within other formatting commands or environments. The parser should be able to handle such cases correctly without missing the bold text or including unwanted text.\n\n3. **Custom Commands**: The document may define custom commands that ultimately result in bold text. Unless the parser is aware of these custom commands, it might miss some bold text.\n\n4. **Comments**: Bold text within comments (anything after a `%` on a line) should not be treated as part of the document.\n\n5. **Complex Environments**: Bold text may appear within complex environments like tables, lists, or custom-defined environments, which could make parsing more challenging.\n\n6. **Line Breaks and Whitespace**: LaTeX is quite flexible with line breaks and whitespace, so the bold command and its associated text might not be on the same line or might have irregular spacing.\n\n7. **Braces Handling**: Braces `{}` are used for grouping in LaTeX; thus, the parser must correctly handle them, especially when they enclose the text meant to be in bold.\n\n8. **Incomplete or Erroneous Commands**: If there are typos or incomplete commands in the LaTeX source, this can lead to challenges in accurately parsing the content.\n\nOnce we have access to the input LaTeX file, we can address these challenges specifically based on the actual content we're dealing with."
