The parser must recognize all possible commands used for including figures.\n\n2. **File path complexity**: Figures might be included with relative or absolute paths, and the paths may contain directories/subdirectories. Handling different path structures could be a challenge.\n\n3. **File extensions**: In LaTeX, it's not necessary to specify the file extension of the image being included (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`). The parser might need to take this into account and extract file names without regard to their extensions.\n\n4. **Optional parameters**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional parameters that modify how the image is displayed (e.g., scale, width, height). These parameters should not be confused with the file name.\n\n5. **Commented code**: Sometimes, LaTeX files contain commented lines with `%`. Figures included in these lines should not be extracted as they are not actually included in the final document.\n\n6. **Multiple figures in one command**: LaTeX allows for including multiple figures within a single command, especially within figure environments or using subfigure packages.\n\n7. **Environment usage**: Figures can be included inside different environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), which might have their own syntactical peculiarities that need to be navigated.\n\n8. **Custom commands and macros**: Some LaTeX documents define custom commands or macros that wrap standard figure inclusion commands. The parser needs to resolve these macros to find the actual file names.\n\n9. **Graphics path command**: LaTeX allows setting a default path for graphics using the `\\graphicspath` command. The parser might need to consider this when extracting file names if only partial paths are used for includes.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a robust parser will need to carefully navigate the LaTeX file's syntax to accurately extract all figure file names."
