This would require understanding the custom macros to identify bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold commands can be nested within other commands or environments, which makes parsing more challenging.\n\n3. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. A `\\textbf{...}` command might be commented out and should not be included as a bold text.\n\n4. **Alternative Commands**: There are other ways to make text bold such as using the `\\bfseries` command or within custom environments, so these need to be considered too.\n\n5. **Brace Matching**: The `{` and `}` braces denote the scope of the `\\textbf` command. Unbalanced or incorrectly matched braces can lead to parsing errors.\n\n6. **Special Characters**: Special characters within the `\\textbf{...}` scope may need to be handled correctly; for example, LaTeX uses `\\\\` for line breaks and `&` for alignment in tables.\n\n7. **Concatenation**: Sometimes, the text within `\\textbf` might be split across lines or concatenated with other commands, which can complicate extraction.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues would help in creating a robust parser for extracting bold text from a LaTeX file."
