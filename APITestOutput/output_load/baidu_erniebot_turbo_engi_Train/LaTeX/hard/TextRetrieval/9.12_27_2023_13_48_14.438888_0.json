We need to account for all these commands.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, making it necessary to correctly parse the hierarchy to extract only the bold text.\n\n3. **Brace Matching**: Bold text is often enclosed within curly braces `{}` following the bold command. Properly matching braces, especially if they are nested, is essential to extract the complete text.\n\n4. **Special Characters and Escape Sequences**: Special characters in LaTeX (e.g., `%`, `$`, `&`, `#`, etc.) and escape sequences (e.g., `\\&`) might be included within bold text. These should be handled correctly.\n\n5. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX are denoted by `%` and should be ignored by the parser as they are not rendered in the final document.\n\n6. **Split Across Lines**: Bold text might be split across lines or even pages, which requires multiline parsing and context retention.\n\n7. **Custom Macros and Environments**: The document may include custom macros or environments that change the text to bold, which would require interpreting or expanding these macros.\n\n8. **Incomplete Code or Errors**: The LaTeX file might have syntax errors or incomplete code, which could confuse the parser if it is expecting well-formed input.\n\n9. **Command Options**: Some commands might have options that modify their behavior. It's important to correctly interpret these options to ensure accurate text extraction.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust parsing strategy should be implemented that can navigate through the structure of a LaTeX document, recognize and handle different bold commands, manage braces and special characters, ignore comments, and handle multiline text appropriately."
