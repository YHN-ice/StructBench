There may also be environments that set text in boldface.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold commands may be nested within other formatting commands or environments, such as italic, underline, or custom-defined LaTeX commands.\n\n3. **Command Parameters**: There might be optional parameters within the bold command that need to be handled correctly, such as `\\textbf[option]{...}`.\n\n4. **Text Concatenation**: The text within the bold command may be broken up by other LaTeX commands, line breaks, or comments, which would need to be concatenated to get the whole bold text.\n\n5. **Comments in LaTeX**: Text within comments (`%`) should not be included, but it could appear as if it's part of the bold text if not properly handled.\n\n6. **Custom Commands**: The LaTeX file might have custom command definitions that change the behavior of the typical bold commands, or create new ones entirely.\n\n7. **Scalability**: If the LaTeX file is very large, efficiently parsing the file without excessive resource consumption could be challenging.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser must be designed to handle these complexities and ensure that it can correctly identify and extract only the text that is meant to be displayed in bold within the final document."
