Multiple Commands: LaTeX can include figures with different commands, such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\epsfig`, or even custom-defined commands in a given document.\n\n2. Options and Arguments: The `\\includegraphics` command may have options that alter the behavior or appearance of the included figure. The filename might not be the first argument, and options could be inside square brackets `[]` before the actual filename.\n\n3. Relative vs. Absolute Paths: The filenames might be given with relative or absolute paths, which might need to be resolved or handled differently based on the requirement.\n\n4. File Extensions: LaTeX often allows omitting file extensions, assuming that the engine will find the appropriate file. This means that some included graphics could be listed without their `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, etc.\n\n5. Multiple Files in One Command: Some LaTeX packages or user-defined macros might allow including multiple files within a single command.\n\n6. Comments: Some lines might be commented out using the `%` symbol, meaning they are not actual commands but comments. These should not be considered when extracting filenames.\n\n7. Cross-References: If a LaTeX document is split across multiple files using `\\input` or `\\include` commands, the figures might be included in those external files and not in the main file being parsed.\n\n8. Environment Wrappers: Figures may be placed inside environments like `figure` or `minipage`, and these environments may contain additional LaTeX code that needs to be navigated to find the actual include command.\n\n9. Custom Macros or Styles: Specific LaTeX templates or styles might define custom macros for including figures, and without knowledge of these macros' definitions, it can be challenging to extract figure filenames.\n\n10. Encoded File Paths or Macros: Some LaTeX files encode paths or use macros to construct filenames dynamically, which can make it hard to extract the actual filename without evaluating the macro.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, these potential complications need to be taken into account when designing the parser or when interpreting the LaTeX commands manually."
