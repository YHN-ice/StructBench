These may require parsing beyond simple text extraction.\n\n3. **Comments and escaped characters**: If the `\\textbf{}` command is commented out or part of a text string rather than a command (e.g., within a `\\verb|...|` or after a `%` sign), it should not be considered for bold text extraction.\n\n4. **Split across lines**: The command and its content might be split across lines, which could complicate regex-based extraction.\n\n5. **Brace matching**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to denote the scope of commands. Correctly matching opening and closing braces, especially when they are nested, is crucial for proper extraction.\n\n6. **Custom commands or macros**: If the document defines custom macros that result in bold text, recognizing these will require parsing the macro definitions and understanding how they apply to the text.\n\n7. **Incomplete or malformed commands**: In some cases, the LaTeX file might contain syntax errors, like unclosed braces or misspelled commands, which would need to be handled gracefully.\n\n8. **Environment-based formatting**: Text may also be made bold within environments like `\\begin{thebibliography}` where entries are often bolded. Understanding the context of where bolding occurs will be necessary.\n\nTo properly extract all bold texts, the parser will need to recognize and handle all these cases appropriately."
