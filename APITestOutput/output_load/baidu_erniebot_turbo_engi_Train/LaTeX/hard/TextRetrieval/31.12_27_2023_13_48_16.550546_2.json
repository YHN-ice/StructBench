LaTeX is capable of inferring the correct file type during compilation, but this can complicate automated extraction of file names.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths:** Figures might be included using both relative and absolute paths. The parser should be able to extract the full path if provided.\n\n4. **Commented Lines:** Figured commands that are commented out should not be considered in the extraction process.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command:** Some LaTeX packages allow including multiple figures with one command, which would necessitate parsing the command's arguments to extract individual file names.\n\n6. **File Path with Spaces:** File paths might contain spaces which can be represented using `\\space` or by enclosing the path in double quotes.\n\nConsidering these potential challenges, I'd parse the LaTeX document carefully, primarily focusing on the `\\includegraphics` commands and related figure environments while handling the various edge cases mentioned above."
