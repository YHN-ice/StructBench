Identifying all possible commands used to include figures is essential.\n\n2. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options that alter its behavior, and the filename might not always be easily extractable if it's not well-formatted or if it includes LaTeX variables or commands.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: LaTeX does not require the file extension for graphics, and it can sometimes infer the type of the file. This means that extensions might be omitted, making it harder to identify the file names.\n\n4. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Figures might be included using relative or absolute paths, and the path structure can vary significantly, possibly including directories.\n\n5. **Commented Code**: Some figure inclusions might be commented out in the LaTeX source, and these should not be counted as included figures.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: If a document defines custom commands or environments to include figures, parsing these correctly can be complex.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Commands like `\\includegraphics` can sometimes be used within other environments (like `figure`) that allow including multiple files in one command.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will help us write a more robust parsing strategy to identify all included figures accurately.
