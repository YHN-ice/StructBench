File path complexities: Figure files might be included with relative or absolute paths, and they may reside in subdirectories. The parser has to resolve these paths correctly.\n3. File extensions: LaTeX sometimes allows for the omission of the file extension when including a figure (e.g., `\\includegraphics{figure}` instead of `\\includegraphics{figure.png}`). The parser might need to infer the correct file type.\n4.

The parser must evaluate these conditions properly.\n6. Custom commands and environments: Users can define custom commands or environments that wrap around the standard figure inclusion commands. The parser needs to understand these customizations to find the included figures.\n7. Commented out lines: If figure inclusion lines are commented out, they should not be considered by the parser.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must have a robust understanding of LaTeX syntax and be able to handle a variety of inclusion scenarios intelligently.
