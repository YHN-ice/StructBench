Each command may have different syntax and options.\n\n3. **Figure Path Variations:** Figure file names might be included with or without their file extensions, and they could be located in subdirectories, which would require parsing the path correctly.\n\n4. **Comments:** LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. If a figure inclusion command is commented out, it should not be considered as an included figure.\n\n5. **Conditionals and Custom Commands:** Some documents may include figures conditionally depending on certain flags or within custom commands that encapsulate the actual include command.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command:** Some LaTeX packages allow for including multiple figures within a single command (e.g., subfigures), which makes parsing more challenging.\n\n7. **File Encoding and Format:** If the LaTeX file has any encoding issues or is in a format that is not plain text, this could complicate the parsing process.\n\n8. **Command Options:** The `\\includegraphics` command can take various options that could be confused with the file name if not parsed correctly.\n\nTo address these obstacles, an accurate parser would need to:\n- Recognize and properly handle LaTeX command syntax.\n- Parse paths and file names accurately, considering possible subdirectories.\n- Ignore commented out lines.\n- Handle conditional includes and custom commands appropriately.\n- Differentiate between command options and file paths/names.\n\nThe parser's accuracy in identifying figure inclusion commands while addressing the above points will determine its success in extracting all figure file names correctly."
