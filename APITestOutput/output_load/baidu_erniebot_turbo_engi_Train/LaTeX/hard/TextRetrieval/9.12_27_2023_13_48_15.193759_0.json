Parsing the bold text without losing the nested formats (like italics in this example) requires careful handling.\n\n3. **Line breaks and whitespace**: The text to be bolded might span across multiple lines or contain significant whitespace that should be preserved in the output.\n\n4. **Comments**: The LaTeX file may contain comments that start with `%`. These comments might have content that looks like bold text, but they should not be extracted as they are not part of the compiled document.\n\n5. **Custom environments or groups**: Bold text could be set within custom environments or between curly braces `{}` groups that change the text formatting to bold. Parsing these correctly would require understanding the scope and effect of such environments.\n\n6. **Bracket balancing**: LaTeX commands often include curly braces `{}` to denote the command's scope. Extracting only the content within the braces while maintaining proper balance can be tricky.\n\nI will need to carefully parse the file to handle these situations properly and accurately extract all bold texts."
