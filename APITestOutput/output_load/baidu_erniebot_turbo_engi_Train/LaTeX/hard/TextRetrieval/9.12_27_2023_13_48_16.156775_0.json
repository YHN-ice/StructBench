Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to extract bold texts:\n\n1. **Custom Commands**: If the LaTeX file defines custom commands that make text bold, we need to recognize these commands in order to extract the bold text correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text can be nested within other formatting commands or environments, such as italics, underlines, or custom defined environments. We need to handle these cases correctly.\n\n3. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. Bold commands within comments should not be counted as they are not actually rendered in the final document.\n\n4. **Brace Matching**: We must correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the text argument of the `\\textbf{}` command accurately, even when there are nested braces.\n\n5. **Conditional Text**: In LaTeX, conditional compilation can be done using commands like `\\if`, `\\else`, etc. We need to make sure to only extract the bold text that is included in the final document.\n\n6. **Multiple Lines**: The argument to `\\textbf{}` might span multiple lines in the source file, so we can't simply rely on regular expressions that match single lines.\n\nTo properly answer your request, I would need to see the input LaTeX file or at least some representative example of its content in order to identify and extract all instances of bold text."
