We'll need to parse these paths correctly.\n\n4. **File extension variety**: Figures can have different file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf, etc.), and sometimes the extension might not be included in the LaTeX command.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX comments (`%`) could hide include commands or parts of them from being processed.\n\n6. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes, LaTeX allows including multiple files within one command, separated by commas.\n\n7. **Environment wrapping**: Figures might be wrapped inside environments (like `figure`), which could complicate the extraction process if we're looking for commands outside of these environments.\n\n8. **Custom commands or macros**: A user might define a custom command to include figures, making it harder to identify without knowing the macro definitions.\n\nOnce we get the input file, we will need to carefully parse it to handle these complexities appropriately to extract all included figure file names."
