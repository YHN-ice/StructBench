Knowing all possible commands is necessary to ensure complete extraction.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text may be nested within other commands or environments, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Custom Commands**: Users can define their own commands in LaTeX, which could include bold formatting. Without knowing these custom definitions, it may be difficult to extract bold texts.\n\n4. **Comments**: Bold text within comments should not be extracted, so we need to ignore content after `%` until the end of the line.\n\n5. **Complex Environments**: Bold text might be within more complex environments such as tables, lists, or custom environments defined by the user.\n\n6. **Brace Matching**: Since LaTeX uses `{}` for command parameters, correct brace matching is essential to extract the entire bold text, especially if there are nested braces.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: If the LaTeX file contains escaped characters like `\\{` or `\\}`, these should not be mistaken for command delimiters.\n\n8. **Line Breaks**: Bold text might span multiple lines, which means that simple line-by-line parsing may not be sufficient.\n\n9. **Different Document Classes and Packages**: Different document classes and packages may handle text formatting differently, which could affect how bold text should be extracted.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a LaTeX parser needs to be quite sophisticated, capable of understanding the context and structure of the LaTeX file, as well as handling the various nuances that come with text formatting in LaTeX documents."
