However, there could be custom commands defined in the preamble or macros that also result in bold text.\n\n2. Nested Commands: The text within `\\textbf{...}` could contain other LaTeX commands, and care must be taken to extract only the text part, not the embedded commands.\n\n3. Custom Environments: If the LaTeX file defines custom environments that render content in bold, it's necessary to recognize these environments and extract text accordingly.\n\n4. Comments and Inactive Code: Text within comments (`%`) should not be extracted as they are not rendered in the final document. Additionally, conditional statements might activate or deactivate certain text.\n\n5. Handling Groups: LaTeX also allows for text to be made bold by using braces with `\\bfseries` before the text like `{\\bfseries ...}`, so it's important to recognize this pattern as well.\n\n6. Multiple Lines: Bold text might span multiple lines, which means the parser needs to handle line breaks correctly within the bold commands.\n\n7. Robustness and Edge Cases: LaTeX files can be very complex, with various edge cases due to the flexibility of LaTeX. The parser must be robust enough to handle unexpected scenarios.\n\nOnce you provide the input LaTeX file or a portion of it, I can attempt to extract the bold texts while addressing these potential obstacles."
