Different commands for bold: In LaTeX, text can be made bold using different commands such as `\\textbf{}`, `\\bf{}`, or even custom commands defined in the preamble that might wrap one of the standard bold commands.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text might be nested within other LaTeX commands or environments, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. Special characters: LaTeX special characters within the bold text could affect the parsing, such as `\\%`, `\\$`, `\\&`, etc.\n\n4. Line breaks and whitespace: Bold text might be split across lines or contain significant whitespace that needs to be handled properly.\n\n5. Comments: The LaTeX file might contain comments (lines starting with `%`) which could include false positives for bold text commands.\n\n6. Conditional text: LaTeX can include conditional statements that may or may not render text in bold depending on certain conditions.\n\n7. Multi-part commands: The `\\textbf` command might be split across lines or separated by comments or other text.\n\n8. Custom environments: If the LaTeX document defines custom environments, bold text may be styled within them without explicit `\\textbf` commands.\n\nTo accurately extract all bold texts, the parser must correctly handle all these potential issues. It will need to understand the LaTeX syntax to a reasonable degree, ignore comments and irrelevant commands, and properly concatenate text that spans multiple lines or has significant whitespace."
