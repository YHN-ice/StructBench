We must identify all possible commands that can be used to include a figure.\n\n2. **Command Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command, for example, may have options specified in square brackets before the file name, which we must correctly parse to get to the actual file name.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Figure file paths can be given as either relative to the LaTeX file location or as absolute paths. We will need to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, LaTeX files may include multiple figures within the same command (for instance, using a loop or a comma-separated list). The parser must be able to handle these cases and extract all file names.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX users often comment out parts of the code using the `%` character. If a figure inclusion command is commented out, it should not be considered.\n\n6. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX users might include the file extension in the command, while others might omit it (relying on LaTeX to automatically determine the appropriate file type). We need to consider both scenarios.\n\n7. **File Path Formatting**: File paths in LaTeX can include spaces or special characters that need to be handled correctly.\n\n8. **Environment Wrapping**: Figures might be included inside environments like `figure` or `minipage`, and the parser must be context-aware to extract file names from within these environments.\n\nHere is how we could tackle some of these issues:\n\n- Use regular expressions to capture variations of figure inclusion commands and accommodate for optional arguments.\n- Filter out lines that are commented out by checking if the line starts with `%` or contains a `%` before the include command.\n- Normalize file paths by handling relative and absolute paths uniformly.\n- Handle special cases where multiple figures might be included in one command by splitting on the appropriate delimiters.\n- Take into account different ways of specifying file names, with or without extensions.\n\nOnce you provide the LaTeX file content, I'll be able to apply these considerations and attempt to extract the figure file names accordingly."
