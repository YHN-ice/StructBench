We need to recognize all possible commands for bold text.\n\n2. Nested Commands: Bold text commands could be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which could complicate the extraction.\n\n3. Command Variations: Custom user-defined commands or macros could be used to represent bold text, which would not be captured by standard parsing for the known bold commands.\n\n4. Inline versus Block: Bold text could be part of a larger block of text, or it could be inline with other text, influencing how we extract it.\n\n5. Escaped Characters: We need to handle escaped characters such as `\\{`, `\\}`, or `\\\\` that may appear within the text and are not actually delimiting LaTeX commands.\n\n6. Comments: Text within comments, marked by `%`, should not be considered as part of the document content and hence should be ignored.\n\n7. Environment Overlaps: Bold text could start in one environment and end in another, which might make extraction tricky.\n\n8. Error Handling: Incomplete or malformed commands for bold text may result in parsing errors which will need to be handled gracefully.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we'll have to account for these potential issues while extracting the bold texts."
