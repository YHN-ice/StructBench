When parsing a LaTeX file to extract included figure files, we might encounter several challenges:\n\n1. **Different include commands**: LaTeX has multiple commands for including graphics (e.g., \\includegraphics, \\include, \\input).

They may also include different file extensions or no extension at all.\n\n3. **Commented lines**: Sometimes, figure inclusion commands may be commented out using the '%' character. We need to ignore commented lines.\n\n4. **Optional arguments**: The \\includegraphics command can have optional arguments that change how the figure is displayed but do not affect which file is included. We need to correctly parse these to get the file name.\n\n5. **Multiple figures in one command**: A single command may include multiple figures, such as in a figure environment with subfigures. We need to extract all file names within such environments.\n\n6. **Custom commands or environments**: A LaTeX document may define custom commands or environments that internally include figures. Without knowledge of these definitions, we might miss included figures.\n\n7. **File name with spaces or special characters**: File names might include spaces or special characters that could complicate the parsing process.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, we will need to carefully parse the LaTeX document, focusing on the syntax of graphics inclusion commands while handling optional arguments and ignoring comments and custom definitions that we can't interpret without additional context."
