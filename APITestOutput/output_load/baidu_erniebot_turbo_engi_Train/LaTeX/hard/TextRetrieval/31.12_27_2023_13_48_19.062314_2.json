Multiple include commands: LaTeX files can include figures using different commands like `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, or even custom commands defined by the user. We need to account for all possible commands that can include a figure.\n\n2. File path variations: The path to the included figure could be absolute or relative, and it could include various directory separators (like `/` or `\\\\` for different operating systems). The parser needs to handle these variations.\n\n3. File extensions: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension when including a figure (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`), but other times they omit it. The parser should be able to recognize both cases.\n\n4. Commented lines: Lines in LaTeX files can be commented out with the `%` symbol. The parser should ignore any figure includes that are commented out.\n\n5. Multiple figures in one command: Sometimes, a single `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple figures within one line, especially if the figures are part of a subfigure environment. The parser needs to be able to extract all filenames in such scenarios.\n\n6. Complex file names: File names might contain spaces, special characters, or be enclosed within quotes or braces. The parser needs to correctly parse these filenames.\n\n7. Figure options: The `\\includegraphics` command can include options (like scale, width, height, etc.) before the file name. The parser must accurately identify the file name and not be confused by these options.\n\nConsidering these challenges, the parser should be robust enough to handle different scenarios and extract the filenames accurately."
