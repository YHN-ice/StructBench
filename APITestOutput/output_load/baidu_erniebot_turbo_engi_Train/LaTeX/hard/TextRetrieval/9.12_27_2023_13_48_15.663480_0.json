Extracting text while keeping track of the correct matching braces is essential.\n\n7. **Escaping characters**: Special characters might be escaped in LaTeX, and the parser needs to handle these correctly to avoid interpreting them as command or parameter delimiters.\n\n8. **Inline vs. block**: Bold text can appear inline within a paragraph or as a separate block of text, which might require different parsing approaches.\n\n9. **Multi-line text**: Some bold commands might span multiple lines, so the parser should handle line breaks appropriately.\n\n10. **Incomplete or malformed commands**: If the LaTeX code contains errors or incomplete commands, the parser might have difficulty extracting the correct text.\n\nThese obstacles will need to be considered when attempting to accurately extract all the bold texts from a LaTeX file."
