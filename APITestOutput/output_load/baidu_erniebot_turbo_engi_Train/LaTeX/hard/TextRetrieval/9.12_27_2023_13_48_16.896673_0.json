The parser needs to handle all possible variants.\n\n2. **Nested Commands:** Bold text commands may be nested within other formatting commands or environments, requiring a more complex parsing strategy to correctly identify the bold text.\n\n3. **Curly Braces Balancing:** LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to denote the scope of commands. Ensuring that the parsing correctly balances opening and closing braces is crucial for accurate extraction.\n\n4. **Custom Macros:** A LaTeX document may define custom macros that encapsulate the `\\textbf` command, requiring the parser to understand these macros to extract bold text.\n\n5. **Comments and Everything Else:** The parser has to ignore LaTeX comments (anything following a `%` until the end of the line) and other non-text elements in the document.\n\n6. **Split across lines:** Bold text might be split across lines or even pages, which means the parser needs to handle line breaks and page breaks properly.\n\n7. **Special Characters:** Handling special characters within bold text (like underscores, ampersands, etc.) that have specific meanings in LaTeX could be tricky.\n\n8. **Optional Arguments:** Some LaTeX commands include optional arguments (`[]`) before the mandatory ones (`{}`). The parser should ignore these but recognize when the bold command is being used.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, extracting bold text from a LaTeX file is a non-trivial task that requires careful consideration of the LaTeX syntax and document structure."
