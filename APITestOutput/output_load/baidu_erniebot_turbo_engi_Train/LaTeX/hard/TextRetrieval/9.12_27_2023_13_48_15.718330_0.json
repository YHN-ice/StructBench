The parser must recognize all these commands.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands, such as italic (`\\textit{}`) or underline (`\\underline{}`). The parser should correctly identify the bold text even when nested.\n\n3. **Custom Macros**: A LaTeX document may define custom macros that make text bold. Without knowing what these macros do, the parser may fail to recognize bold text created by them.\n\n4. **Comments**: If the LaTeX file has comments (using `%`), the parser should ignore anything within comments that might look like bold text commands.\n\n5. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to enclose arguments for commands. The parser must correctly handle nested braces.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of LaTeX commands might be escaped (like `\\{`), and the parser should not confuse them with actual command starts.\n\n7. **Environments**: Bold texts can also be inside environments which could have their own sets of braces and formatting rules.\n\n8. **Incomplete Commands**: If the LaTeX source is incomplete or has errors (like missing closing braces), the parser has to handle these gracefully.\n\nAny parser designed to extract bold texts from a LaTeX file must be able to handle these complexities and variations in LaTeX syntax."
