Parsing may require resolving these references to give a complete answer.\n\n6. **Non-standard document classes or packages:** The behavior and structure can change with different document classes or packages, which could affect the parsing logic.\n\n7. **Styling commands:** Commands that affect styling might be present within the content, and depending on the request, may need to be included or filtered out.\n\n8. **Possible errors in the LaTeX code:** If the LaTeX file contains errors or unfinished parts, it could hinder the parsing process.\n\n9. **Encoding**: LaTeX files are generally plain text but can have different encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.), which might affect text extraction if not properly handled.\n\n10. **Command definitions within the document:** The LaTeX file might contain new command definitions that change how subsequent text should be interpreted.\n\nOnce provided with the input file, I would look for the `\\section`, `\\subsection`, and `\\subsubsection` commands to locate the required content, taking into account these potential obstacles."
