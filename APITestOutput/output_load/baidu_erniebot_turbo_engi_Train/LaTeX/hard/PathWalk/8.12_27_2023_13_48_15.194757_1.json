Without compilation, these references would appear as commands (e.g., `\\ref{label_name}`).\n\n5. **In-text Commands and Formatting**: LaTeX documents can contain in-text formatting commands (e.g., `\\textbf{}`, `\\emph{}`) that affect how text is displayed. Deciding if and how to present these commands as part of the extracted content might be necessary.\n\n6. **Latex Preamble and Macros**: The preamble of a LaTeX document can include packages and macros that affect how sections and subsections are defined and displayed. These need to be understood or ignored appropriately.\n\n7. **Multiple Files**: Large LaTeX projects may be split across multiple files using `\\input` or `\\include` commands, which could make it difficult to locate specific content without access to all files.\n\n8. **Encoding and Special Characters**: LaTeX files can contain special characters and may use different encoding schemes, which could affect text extraction if not properly accounted for.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles will help in approaching the task of parsing the LaTeX file and extracting the specified content accurately."
