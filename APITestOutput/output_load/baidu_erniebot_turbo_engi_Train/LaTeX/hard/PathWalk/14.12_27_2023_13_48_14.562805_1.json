If the content in question is in an external file, it may not be visible in the main file.\n\n4. **Conditional compilation**: LaTeX can conditionally include or exclude content using conditional commands like `\\if`, `\\ifdef`, etc. Depending on the conditions set before compiling, different content might be included in the output.\n\n5. **Comments**: Content could be hidden within comments, denoted by `%` signs, which would not appear in the compiled document but would still be present in the .tex file.\n\n6. **Cross-referencing:** The structure and flow might rely on labels and references that are not immediately clear without compiling the document.\n\nTo accurately extract the required information, I will need to parse the LaTeX source code while considering these potential challenges. Please provide the LaTeX file or the relevant excerpt so that I can attempt to find and extract the content of the specified subsubsection."
