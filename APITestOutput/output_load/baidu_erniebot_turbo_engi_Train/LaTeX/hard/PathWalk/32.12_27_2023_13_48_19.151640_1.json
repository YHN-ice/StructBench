These should be maintained in the extracted text to reflect the intended emphasis.\n\n7. **Inclusion of External Files**: Parts of the document might be included from external files using commands like `\\input` or `\\include`. To parse these parts, the external files would need to be accessed and parsed as well.\n\n8. **Complex Structures**: Some LaTeX documents use complex structures for organizing content, like custom macros or environments that could obscure the hierarchy of sections, subsections, and subsubsections.\n\nTo provide an accurate excerpt from the LaTeX file as requested, a parser will need to handle these potential challenges while maintaining the hierarchical structure and context of the requested subsubsection."
