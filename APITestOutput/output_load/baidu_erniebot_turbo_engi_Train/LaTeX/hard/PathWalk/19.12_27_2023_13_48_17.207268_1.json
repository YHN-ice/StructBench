Some commands can change the behavior of subsequent text, which could make parsing difficult without knowing the context.\n\n2. **Custom Commands and Environments**: LaTeX allows the definition of custom commands and environments which may not be known beforehand. This means that the parser needs to be adaptable to handle such customizations.\n\n3. **Nested Environments**: LaTeX environments can be nested within each other, which can create a complex structure that needs to be navigated correctly to extract the content accurately.\n\n4. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX are ignored by the LaTeX compiler but would be visible in the source file. A parser must differentiate between content and comments.\n\n5. **Conditional Compilation**: The content in a LaTeX file could be conditionally included or excluded using various commands (such as `\\if`, `\\ifdef`, `\\ifndef`, etc.), making the parsing context-dependent.\n\n6. **Inclusion of Other Files**: LaTeX documents can be modular, with portions of the document included from other files using `\\input` or `\\include` commands. This can obscure the content unless those files are also parsed.\n\n7. **Formatting Commands**: Text formatting commands (like `\\textbf`, `\\emph`, etc.) are scattered throughout the document and need to be interpreted or stripped out based on the requirements of the output.\n\n8. **Cross-referencing**: References to other parts of the document (such as `\\label`, `\\ref`, `\\cite`) imply a non-linear structure that might need resolution.\n\nTo give an accurate excerpt including any subsections, the parser must navigate these potential hurdles and correctly interpret the LaTeX markup to output plain text, formatting commands, or a combination of both as required."
