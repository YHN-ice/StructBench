This could make it difficult to recognize section headings without understanding these commands.\n\n3. **Comments and Conditionals**: Content within comments (`%`) should not be included, and conditional statements may alter which sections are actually included in the final document.\n\n4. **Cross-referencing**: LaTeX allows for labels and references, which may appear as incomplete information when viewed outside of the compiled document context.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Labeling**: There is no strict enforcement on section numbering in LaTeX, which could lead to mislabeling or non-sequential numbering that confuses the hierarchy.\n\n6. **External Files**: LaTeX allows for modularity by including external files with commands like `\\input` or `\\include`. The content of a subsection could be in another file, making it challenging to retrieve without access to that file.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, we can assess which of these potential difficulties apply and how to overcome them to extract the requested information accurately."
