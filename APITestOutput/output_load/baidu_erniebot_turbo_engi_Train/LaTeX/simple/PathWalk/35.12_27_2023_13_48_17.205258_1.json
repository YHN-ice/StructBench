Proper parsing would need to account for these and extract text accordingly.\n\n4. **References and Citations**: LaTeX files commonly include references and citations that are linked to a bibliography or a reference list. These may not be fully resolved without processing the entire document, which can affect the extraction of clean text.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX comments (indicated by `%`) are ignored by the LaTeX compiler but may be present in the file. The parser needs to ignore these.\n\n6. **Conditional Statements**: LaTeX allows for conditional compilation (using `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`), which can alter the content that gets included in the final document. Thus, understanding these conditions is necessary to determine what is actually part of the subsection.\n\n7. **External Files**: A LaTeX document can include external files using `\\input` or `\\include`. If the relevant content is in an external file, the parser must also be able to handle those files.\n\n8. **Command Parameters and Options**: Some commands can alter their behavior based on parameters and options provided, which can affect how content should be interpreted (e.g., `\\section*` vs. `\\section`).\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it will be important to carefully parse the structure of the LaTeX file to ensure that the content of the specified section and subsection is accurately extracted."
