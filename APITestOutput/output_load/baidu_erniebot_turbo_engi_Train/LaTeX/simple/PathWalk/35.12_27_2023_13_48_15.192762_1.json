If the document uses such commands for sections, it could make it more difficult to parse without knowing what these commands do.\n\n3. **Comments**: Content might be commented out using the `%` symbol. Comments should not be confused with actual content.\n\n4. **Conditional Compilation**: LaTeX allows for conditional compilation where certain sections may only be included if certain conditions are met (e.g., using `\\if` commands). This could affect which content is actually part of the final document.\n\n5. **Multiple Files**: LaTeX documents can be split over multiple files using `\\input` or `\\include` commands. If the relevant subsection is in a separate file, one would need to parse that file as well.\n\n6. **Environment Conflicts**: LaTeX environments (like figures, tables, equations) can contain subsection-like commands that don't actually denote a subsection of the text.\n\n7. **Nested Environments**: Subsections themselves can contain multiple nested environments that have to be correctly identified and extracted.\n\n8. **Special Characters and Formatting**: Special characters and formatting commands (like `\\textbf`, `\\emph`, etc.) need to be correctly interpreted or stripped away as needed, depending on the requirement of the output.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in creating a strategy to extract the desired content accurately from the LaTeX source file."
