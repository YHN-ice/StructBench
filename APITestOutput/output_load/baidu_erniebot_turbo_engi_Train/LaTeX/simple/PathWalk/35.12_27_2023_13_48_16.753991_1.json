Custom Commands and Macros: Users can define their own commands and macros in LaTeX, which may not be easily recognizable without the context or knowledge of these definitions.\n\n4. Cross-Referencing: LaTeX documents often use labels and references to manage cross-referencing; understanding these without parsing the entire document might be impossible.\n\n5. Conditional Compilation: LaTeX supports conditional compilation using packages like `comment` or commands like `\\if`, making it difficult to know which parts of the content are included without evaluating these conditions.\n\n6.
