Without access to these files, it could be difficult to provide the complete content of a section.\n\n6. **Unconventional Formatting**: The author may use unconventional formatting or structuring that does not follow standard LaTeX practices, making it hard to parse.\n\n7. **Cross-referencing**: Some sections may contain cross-references to other parts of the document, which would need to be resolved to provide a complete picture.\n\nBefore proceeding, ensure you have the correct tools and understanding of the LaTeX structure to handle these obstacles effectively."
