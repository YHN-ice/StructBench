Extracting plain text while retaining the correct structure and hierarchy can be tricky.\n\n2. **Commands and Environments**: Understanding which commands denote sections, subsections, and other divisions is crucial. LaTeX allows for custom definitions of such commands, so one must be aware of the document's specific structure.\n\n3. **Nested Content**: Subsections might be nested within sections, and parsing them requires careful tracking of the document hierarchy.\n\n4. **Conditional Compilation**: LaTeX supports conditional compilation (with `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`), which might hide or reveal certain parts of the document depending on flags that might not be visible in the excerpt.\n\n5. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX (denoted with `%`) could contain keywords that appear to denote sections or subsections but should not be included in the parsed content.\n\n6. **Cross-referencing**: LaTeX documents often include cross-references (like `\\label` and `\\ref`) that might not make sense out of context or require resolving for a complete understanding of the content.\n\n7. **Multiple Files**: LaTeX documents can be split across multiple files using `\\input` or `\\include`. If the content of a section is in a different file, it might not be directly accessible without that additional file.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a LaTeX parser must:\n\n- Interpret the structure correctly by recognizing and processing commands for document organization.\n- Account for nested environments and balance the begin-end pairs.\n- Handle comments appropriately by ignoring them.\n- Deal with conditional content based on compilation flags.\n- Resolve references where necessary or at least recognize them as such.\n- Access all necessary files if the document is split across multiple files.\n\nOnce these hurdles are addressed, the parser should be able to extract the content of the specified subsection accurately."
