It requires understanding of all these commands to correctly extract bold texts.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text could be nested within other commands or environments, making extraction more complex. For example, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{important} text}` where \"important\" is emphasized within the bold text.\n\n3. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that change the font weight to bold, which would not be immediately recognizable as such without parsing and understanding the preamble or style files.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Bold commands within commented sections (`%`) should not be considered active text.\n\n5. **Conditional Compilation**: Parts of the LaTeX document might be included or excluded from the final document based on conditions, so it's necessary to determine whether the condition includes the bold text in the final output.\n\n6. **Brace Matching**: LaTeX commands often use braces `{}` to encompass their arguments, and sometimes these braces are nested. It requires keeping track of brace matching to correctly extract the text.\n\n7. **Multi-line Arguments**: The argument for a bold command might span multiple lines, so a parser should be able to handle multi-line inputs.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a parser should:\n\n- Recognize all the different commands that can make text bold.\n- Handle nested structures and brace matching properly.\n- Ignore commented sections and inactive code.\n- Be aware of custom commands or environments that may not be explicit in terms of changing font weight.\n- Handle conditional compilation logic if present.\n- Process multi-line arguments seamlessly.\n\nNow, you can provide the LaTeX input file for further analysis and extraction of bold texts."
