Paths could also use different directory separators depending on the operating system.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: LaTeX allows for the inclusion of graphics without specifying the file extension. Therefore, the parser must be able to handle file names both with and without extensions.\n\n4. **Comments**: The LaTeX file may contain comments (lines starting with `%`) that include strings formatted like include commands. These should not be counted as actual includes.\n\n5. **Complex Commands**: Sometimes figures are included within custom commands or environments, or the filename is constructed dynamically within the LaTeX code. This can make it harder to extract the filenames.\n\n6. **Figure Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can contain options before the filename, which need to be parsed correctly to extract only the filename.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command may include multiple figures, especially when using commands that allow for subfigures.\n\n8. **File Encodings and Formats**: Different LaTeX files may have different encodings (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.), and figures might not be included in a standardized way (e.g., using `\\graphicspath`).\n\n9. **Conditionals or Macros**: There could be conditional statements that include different figures under different conditions or macros that are defined to simplify figure inclusion but complicate parsing.\n\nConsidering these challenges, the parser would need to be designed to handle a wide variety of LaTeX practices for including figures and robustly extract the filenames while ignoring non-figure include commands or commented-out lines."
