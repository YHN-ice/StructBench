Handling different path formats consistently can be challenging.\n\n3. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. A figure command inside a comment should not be considered.\n\n4. **Command options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options like scaling and rotation that might complicate the regex or parsing logic.\n\n5. **Multiple figures in one command**: In some cases, LaTeX allows including multiple figures within one command, like in a `\\foreach` loop or within a figure matrix environment.\n\n6. **Complex environments**: Figures might be included within complex environments like `figure`, `minipage`, or custom-defined environments, adding complexity to parsing.\n\n7. **Nested files**: LaTeX documents can include other files using the `\\input` or `\\include` commands, which might in turn include figures. This nested structure can complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. **Figure wrappers**: Sometimes figures are wrapped in additional custom commands defined by the user, which might not be standard across different documents.\n\nIn order to accurately extract figure file names, a parser must navigate these challenges by being flexible and robust against various LaTeX practices and conventions."
