Each of these would need to be handled separately.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: The path to the figure files can be given in various forms, including relative paths, absolute paths, or using LaTeX's graphics path setting. Paths may also include directories, which would need to be traversed or taken into account.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Sometimes the LaTeX file will specify the file extension of the image (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`), but other times it will be omitted, assuming LaTeX to automatically detect it. This means the parser should be ready to handle file names with and without extensions.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Portions of the LaTeX code might be commented out or otherwise inactive. The parser must differentiate between active and inactive code to avoid extracting file names from those parts.\n\n5. **Complex File Names**: File names might contain spaces, special characters, or LaTeX commands themselves. Proper parsing rules need to be applied to extract such complex file names correctly.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command (among others) may contain optional arguments that the parser must ignore when extracting the file name, for example, scaling and rotation options.\n\n7. **Figure Environments**: Figures are often wrapped in `\\begin{figure}` ... `\\end{figure}` environments. The parser should recognize these environments but focus on the commands that actually include graphics files.\n\n8. **Groups and Scopes**: Sometimes the command to include a figure may be within a LaTeX group or scope, which might alter how paths are interpreted or how commands are executed.\n\n9. **Command Redefinitions**: In some LaTeX documents, standard commands might have been redefined, which could change the expected behavior for including figure files.\n\nThe parser will need to account for these potential issues to accurately extract all figure file names from the LaTeX source code provided."
