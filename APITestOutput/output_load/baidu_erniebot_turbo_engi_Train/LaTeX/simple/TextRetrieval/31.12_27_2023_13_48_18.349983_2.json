These options come in square brackets before the file name and should not be confused with the file name itself.\n\n3. **File path complexity**: Figures may be included using relative or absolute paths, and the paths might contain directories. The parser needs to extract just the file names or the full path as required.\n\n4. **File extensions**: LaTeX can work without specifying the file extension of the image, relying on the compiler to find the appropriate version (e.g., .png, .jpg, .pdf). The parser must handle cases both with and without file extensions.\n\n5. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes figures are included in a row or within a single environment. The parser must correctly identify each file name in such cases.\n\n6. **Commented code**: The LaTeX file might contain commented out lines that include figure commands. The parser should ignore anything that is commented out.\n\n7. **Custom commands and environments**: Some LaTeX documents define custom commands or environments that wrap standard figure inclusion commands. Unless these are standardized and accounted for, they might be missed by a simple parsing algorithm.\n\n8. **Complex environments**: Figures might be included inside complex environments like `figure`, `minipage`, `subfigure`, etc., and could be within nested environments which makes parsing challenging.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, the parser must overcome these difficulties and correctly extract only the intended figure file names from the LaTeX source code."
