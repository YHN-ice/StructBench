Additionally, some documents may use custom commands or environments that result in bold text.\n\n2. **Nested Commands:** Bold text commands can be nested within other commands or environments, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Brace Matching:** Since LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` to indicate the scope of commands, correctly matching opening and closing braces is essential to extract the complete text that is intended to be bold.\n\n4. **Special Characters:** Special characters and LaTeX commands within the bold text need to be handled properly.\n\n5. **Comments:** LaTeX comments, which begin with `%`, might contain bold commands that are commented out and should not be counted as actual content.\n\n6. **Multiple Lines:** A bold command may span multiple lines, so the parser must be able to handle line breaks within the command.\n\n7. **Conditional Text or Macros:** Some LaTeX documents may include conditionals or macros that change how text is rendered. These might affect whether or not text is actually bold in the final document.\n\n8. **Custom Styles or Classes:** Some LaTeX documents define custom styles or classes that include bold formatting, which would not be immediately recognizable without parsing the document class or style files.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a LaTeX file parser would need to implement a robust parsing algorithm that can handle nested structures, match braces accurately, ignore comments, and recognize all possible ways that bold text can be indicated in a LaTeX document."
