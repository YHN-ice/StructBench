Both cases need to be handled.\n\n5. **Brace balancing**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to scope commands, and extracting text requires careful tracking of opening and closing braces.\n\n6. **Custom macros**: LaTeX allows users to define their own macros, which may include bold text. Identifying and interpreting these could be complex without executing the LaTeX file.\n\n7. **Comments and ignored content**: LaTeX comments (anything after `%` on a line) should not be processed. Additionally, any text in a `\\comment{...}` block or similar should be ignored.\n\n8. **Complex environments**: Certain LaTeX environments like tables, figures, or custom environments might contain bold text with additional formatting that needs special handling.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, an accurate extraction process requires a robust understanding of the LaTeX syntax and potentially a full LaTeX parser that can handle all the intricacies of the LaTeX language."
