Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might be encountered when parsing a LaTeX file to extract included figure files:\n\n1. **Multiple Commands**: LaTeX offers different commands to include figures such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, etc. We need to identify all possible commands that could include a figure.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: Figure file paths can be written in various ways, including relative paths, absolute paths, or without any path if they are in the same directory. Moreover, the file extension may be omitted, as LaTeX can automatically determine it.\n\n3. **Comments**: Figures might be commented out in LaTeX using the `%` sign. These commented lines should not be considered when extracting figure filenames.\n\n4. **Figure Environments**: Figures could be within different environments like `figure`, `figure*`, `subfigure`, etc., and these environments might have additional parameters that are not related to the file path which need to be ignored.\n\n5. **Custom Commands or Macros**: A custom command or macro could be defined in the document for including figures, which might not be straightforward to identify without executing the LaTeX code.\n\n6. **Brace Styles**: LaTeX allows for different brace styles, such as curly braces `{}` or square brackets `[]` for including optional arguments. The parser must correctly interpret these to extract the file names.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Line**: Sometimes, more than one figure could be included in a single line of code separated by commas or other characters.\n\n8. **Package Options**: Some packages might change the syntax for including figures, and these need to be accounted for.\n\nEach of these points represents a possible challenge that must be overcome to accurately extract all figure file names from a LaTeX document."
