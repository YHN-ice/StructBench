We need to account for all possible variations.\n\n2. **Nested Commands:** Bold text might be nested within other commands or environments, which adds complexity to the parsing. For example, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{bold} text}` contains emphasized text within bold text.\n\n3. **Brace Matching:** LaTeX commands often use braces `{}` to enclose arguments. It's necessary to correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the correct text, especially in the presence of nested commands.\n\n4. **Comments:** Text within comments `% ...` should not be considered part of the document and thus should be ignored when extracting bold text.\n\n5. **Conditional Text:** LaTeX may include conditional text that is included or excluded based on certain conditions (e.g., using `\\if ... \\fi`). Handling this requires understanding the conditions.\n\n6. **Custom Macros:** The document may define custom macros that change the appearance of text to bold, which would need to be recognized by the parser.\n\n7. **Incompatibility with Encodings:** If the LaTeX document uses a unique encoding or has special characters, it might be necessary to handle these appropriately to avoid parsing errors or incorrect outputs.\n\n8. **Environments Affecting Text Style:** Some environments, like `\\begin{theorem}`, might automatically apply a bold style to some parts of the text. These environments need to be recognized and parsed accordingly.\n\n9. **Cross-referencing Labels:** There may be labels in bold text that are used for cross-referencing that need to be parsed correctly, such as in `\\textbf{\\label{sec:intro}Introduction}`.\n\n10. **Incomplete Commands:** If the LaTeX file is not complete or has syntax errors, such as missing closing braces, this can cause incorrect parsing results.\n\nTo accurately extract bold texts, a parser should be designed to handle these intricacies appropriately.
