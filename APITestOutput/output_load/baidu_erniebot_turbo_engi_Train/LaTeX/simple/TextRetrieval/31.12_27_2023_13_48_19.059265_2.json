We need to be prepared to handle all relevant commands.\n\n2. **Variety of options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have many options specified within square brackets before the actual file name. Parsing needs to account for these and still correctly identify the file name.\n\n3. **Path specification**: The file names could include relative or absolute paths, which would need to be parsed correctly to extract just the file name or the full path as required.\n\n4. **File extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files may include the file extension, and sometimes they may not. The parser should consider both scenarios.\n\n5. **Commented lines**: Lines containing figure includes may be commented out in the LaTeX source, so the parser should ignore those lines.\n\n6. **Multiple figures in one command**: There are LaTeX packages that allow including multiple figures within a single command (e.g., subfigures), which might complicate parsing.\n\n7. **Custom commands and environments**: Users might define their own commands or environments to include figures, which would not be recognized by a standard parsing approach unless specifically accounted for.\n\n8. **Figure files outside of the document**: If the LaTeX document uses externally defined commands from other files or packages to include figures, those might not be directly visible in the LaTeX source code being parsed.\n\n9. **Uncommon file types**: While most figures are in common image formats like .png, .jpg, .eps, etc., sometimes LaTeX can include other types of files as figures.\n\nTo correctly extract all included figure file names, the parser must handle all these potential issues effectively."
