We need to handle both cases.\n\n8. **Environment Context**: Figures can be included within different environments (like `figure`, `minipage`), and sometimes the environment itself can affect how the filename should be extracted.\n\n9. **Line Breaks**: Filenames might be split across lines or have line breaks before/after them, which requires proper handling to extract the full filename.\n\n10. **Escaped Characters**: In LaTeX, certain characters might be escaped (like `%`, `{`, `}`, `#`, etc.), and if these are part of a filename, they need to be interpreted correctly.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful consideration of the LaTeX syntax and potentially building a robust parsing mechanism that can handle various cases and exceptions."
