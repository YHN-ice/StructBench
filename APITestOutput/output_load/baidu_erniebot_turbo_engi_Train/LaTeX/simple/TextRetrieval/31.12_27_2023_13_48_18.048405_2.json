Different argument specifications: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments for specifying the path or formatting options, which may complicate the extraction of the pure file name.\n\n3. Relative and absolute paths: Figures can be included using both relative and absolute paths, and the parser must correctly resolve these to extract the file names.\n\n4. Multiple figures in one command: It's possible to include multiple figures within a single command, for example by using a wildcard character like `*` in the file name, or by specifying multiple files separated by commas.\n\n5. Commented lines: Lines that are commented out should not be considered, as these do not result in included figures in the final document.\n\n6. File extensions: Some LaTeX users may omit the file extension when including graphics, assuming that LaTeX will find the appropriate file.
