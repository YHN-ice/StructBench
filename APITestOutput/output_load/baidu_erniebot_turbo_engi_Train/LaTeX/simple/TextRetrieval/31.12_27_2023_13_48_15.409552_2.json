We need to identify all possible commands that can be used to include figure files.\n\n2. **File Extension Omission:** LaTeX allows the omission of file extensions when including graphics. The parser must consider this and potentially look up the corresponding file with common graphic file extensions such as `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.pdf`, `.eps`, etc.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths:** The figure files can be included using both relative and absolute paths. The parser must handle both types of paths correctly.\n\n4. **Commented Lines:** LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. Any command within a commented line should be ignored by the parser.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command:** Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures, especially when using commands like `\\includegraphics` inside a loop or using a custom command that includes multiple figures.\n\n6. **Graphics Inside Environments:** Figures might be included within different environments, like `figure`, `minipage`, or user-defined environments. The parser has to correctly identify the include commands within these environments.\n\n7. **Optional Arguments:** The `\\includegraphics` command and others might have optional arguments that can complicate parsing the filename.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, careful consideration will be required to accurately extract all figure file names from a LaTeX document. Please provide the LaTeX input file so I can proceed with extracting the included figure file names."
