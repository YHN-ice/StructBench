The most common commands are `\\textbf{...}` and `{\\bfseries ...}`, but there may be custom commands defined in the preamble or included packages that also result in bold text. We must recognize all possible commands.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested within other LaTeX commands, which can complicate the extraction process. For example, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{important} text}` has emphasis nested within bold text.\n\n3. **Command parameters**: The argument to a bold command might include other LaTeX markup or commands that are not part of the text itself. These should be ignored when extracting just the raw text.\n\n4. **Environment-based bolding**: In addition to commands, LaTeX also has environments that can make their content bold, such as `{\\bfseries ...}`. Handling these correctly requires paying attention to the environment beginnings and ends.\n\n5. **Custom macros or styles**: The file might contain custom macros or style files that change the behavior of standard commands or introduce new ways to make text bold. Without knowing these, we might miss some bold text.\n\n6. **Comments**: Text that appears to be bold within comments (lines starting with `%`) is not actually part of the document and thus should not be extracted.\n\n7. **Split commands**: Sometimes LaTeX commands can be split across lines or have optional arguments which can make parsing difficult. A command like `\\textbf` might be used with square brackets for optional arguments before the curly braces containing the text to be bolded: `\\textbf[options]{text}`.\n\nNow, let's proceed to see the input file and try to extract the bold texts accordingly. Please provide the LaTeX input so I can assist you further."
