Each command might be used differently or have different syntax for specifying the file path.\n\n2. **File Path Syntax**: Figure file paths may be given in various formats, relative or absolute, with or without file extensions. The parser must correctly interpret all these formats.\n\n3. **Comments**: The LaTeX file may contain comments that include lines that look like figure inclusion commands but are actually commented out. The parser should ignore these.\n\n4. **Nested Files**: Sometimes LaTeX documents are split into multiple files using `\\input` or `\\include` commands. Figures might be included in these nested files, which means the parser might need to recursively analyze included files.\n\n5. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command may have optional arguments that change how the figure is included (e.g., scale, width, height). The parser needs to ignore these options to extract only the file name.\n\n6. **Environment Usage**: Figures are often wrapped within `figure` environments or other custom environments. The parser must recognize the relevant commands within these environments.\n\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: There might be commands that include multiple figures at once, especially in cases of subfigures.\n\n8. **Custom Commands or Macros**: The document may define custom commands or macros that include figures, which the parser would need to understand and expand to find the included files.\n\nFor a perfect extraction, the parser must handle all these cases correctly. Please provide the LaTeX file content now, so I can proceed with extracting the included figure files."
