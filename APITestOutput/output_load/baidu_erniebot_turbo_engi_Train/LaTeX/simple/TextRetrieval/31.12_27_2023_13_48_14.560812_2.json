The parser needs to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: A single `\\includegraphics` command might include multiple files, especially if conditional compilation is used, or if the file name is constructed using LaTeX commands.\n\n5. **Comments and Line Breaks**: Figures included in comments should not be considered. Line breaks can also occur within `\\includegraphics` options or file paths, which complicates the parsing.\n\n6. **Graphics Path Declaration**: If the LaTeX file uses a `\\graphicspath` declaration, it changes the base path for all subsequent `\\includegraphics` commands.\n\n7. **Options in Include Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command can include options such as scale, width, height, etc. The parser needs to differentiate between options and the actual file name.\n\n8. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics`, which would require understanding these custom definitions to extract the correct file names.\n\n9. **Multiple Passes and Conditional Inclusion**: Files may be conditionally included based on certain flags or variables set in the document, requiring multiple passes or logic to determine what's actually included.\n\n10. **Encoding and Special Characters**: File paths may include special characters or spaces that are encoded in a specific way in LaTeX, and the parser needs to correctly interpret these.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to consider these potential issues to successfully extract all figure file names."
