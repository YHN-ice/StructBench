Some LaTeX compilers automatically append common image extensions if not provided.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes a single command might include multiple figures, especially within figure environments or when using subfigure packages.\n\n5. **Comments**: Figure includes could be commented out in the LaTeX source, so they are not actually included in the final document. We would need to ignore those lines.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: The LaTeX document could define custom commands or environments that include figures, making it more difficult to identify without executing those commands.\n\n7. **Nested Files**: The LaTeX document might use `\\input` or `\\include` to nest other .tex files which in turn may include figures. These would require parsing multiple files.\n\nWith these potential difficulties in mind, we can now proceed to parse the LaTeX file provided and extract the list of included figure files, keeping an eye out for these potential issues."
