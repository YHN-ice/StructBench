For example:\n   - `\\includegraphics{filename}`\n   - `\\includegraphics[width=60mm]{filename}`\n   - `\\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{filename}`\n\n2. **Relative or absolute paths**: The figures might have relative or full paths, which need to be handled accordingly. For example:\n   - `figures/myfigure.png`\n   - `/home/user/documents/figures/myfigure.png`\n\n3. **File extensions**: Some LaTeX files may omit the file extension when including graphics (LaTeX can automatically determine the correct file type in some cases). So, it's necessary to consider filenames with and without extensions.\n\n4. **Multiple figures in one command**: The `\\includegraphics` command might be used within a figure environment that includes multiple subfigures, each with its own file.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` character. If a line containing `\\includegraphics` is commented out, it should not be considered.\n\n6. **Custom commands**: Sometimes users define new commands that wrap around `\\includegraphics`, so it's necessary to check for those custom definitions.\n\n7. **Graphics included in other files**: Sometimes, a LaTeX document includes other files using the `\\input` or `\\include` command, and those files may contain graphics. It would be necessary to also parse those files to extract all figure filenames.\n\n8. **Complex environments**: Graphics could be included inside complex environments (like `figure`, `minipage`, etc.), which might add complexity to parsing due to nested structures.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it's crucial to apply a careful parsing strategy to accurately extract all figure filenames from the provided LaTeX document."
