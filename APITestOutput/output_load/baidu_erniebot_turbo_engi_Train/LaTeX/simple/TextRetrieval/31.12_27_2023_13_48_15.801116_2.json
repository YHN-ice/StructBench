The parser should disregard such lines.\n\n5. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have optional arguments that could contain brackets, making it more challenging to extract the filename correctly.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: There could be LaTeX commands that include multiple figures in one line (e.g., using subfigure packages).\n\n7. **Complex File Names**: Filenames with spaces, special characters, or multiple dots can complicate the parsing process.\n\n8. **File Name Extraction Logic**: Depending on how the filenames are included, there may be a need for custom logic to extract just the filename if additional text or LaTeX commands follow the filename within the same line.\n\n9. **Macro Expansion**: Filenames might be included via macros or commands that need to be expanded before the actual filename can be determined.\n\n10. **Concatenated File Names**: Sometimes in LaTeX, file names are concatenated using variables and LaTeX commands which might be difficult to resolve without executing the code.\n\nRecognizing and handling all these scenarios ensures accurate extraction of figure file names from a LaTeX document."
