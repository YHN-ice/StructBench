This means the parser must handle both cases.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures, especially within a figure environment with subfigures.\n\n5. **Figure Options**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options that specify the width, height, scale, etc., of the image, which can be a part of the same brackets as the file name, making parsing more challenging.\n\n6. **Comments**: Parts of a LaTeX document, including figure inclusions, may be commented out. The parser needs to ignore commented lines to avoid extracting file names from them.\n\n7. **Custom Commands**: A LaTeX document may define custom commands that internally use standard figure-inclusion commands. These would require special handling to extract figure file names.\n\n8. **Environment Variations**: Figures can be included inside different environments, like `figure`, `minipage`, or even user-defined environments, which might change how file names are specified.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be designed with a robust understanding of LaTeX syntax and should focus on the most common patterns used for including figures in LaTeX documents."
