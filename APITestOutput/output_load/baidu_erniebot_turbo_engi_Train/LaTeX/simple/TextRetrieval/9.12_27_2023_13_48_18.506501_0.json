We need to correctly identify these commands and any variations to extract the bold text.\n\n2. Handling Nested Commands: Bold text commands might contain other formatting commands or be nested within them. We must ensure that our parser can handle such cases and still extract the bold text correctly.\n\n3. Dealing with Custom Commands: Users might define their own commands for bold text that do not follow the standard LaTeX conventions. If the file contains such custom commands, we need to be able to recognize them.\n\n4. Multiple Environments: Bold text might appear within different environments, such as figures, tables, or custom-defined environments. The parser should work across these different contexts.\n\n5. Incomplete or Malformed Commands: The LaTeX file could have syntax errors or incomplete commands, which could make parsing difficult.\n\n6. Comments: The LaTeX file might contain comments that include the word “bold” or similar, which are not actual bold text commands but should be ignored by the parser.\n\n7. Large Data Sets: If the LaTeX file is very large, the parser needs to be efficient enough to handle and process the data without taking too much time or memory.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we can apply an appropriate strategy to extract the bold text while being mindful of these potential issues."
