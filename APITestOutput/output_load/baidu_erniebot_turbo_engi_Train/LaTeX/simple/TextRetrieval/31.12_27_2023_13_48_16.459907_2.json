We would need to recognize all possible commands used for including images.\n\n2. **File Path Variations**: The path to the image file can be given with or without the file extension, and it can be a relative or an absolute path. We need to account for these variations when extracting the filenames.\n\n3. **Comments and Comments Blocks**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. Anything following this symbol on the same line is ignored by LaTeX. We need to make sure we ignore these comments when parsing.\n\n4. **Multiple Includegraphics in One Line**: Sometimes, LaTeX users might include more than one image on a single line, separated by commas or inside a figure environment with subfigures. We should handle these cases correctly.\n\n5. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command may contain optional arguments within square brackets before the filename, which could include additional settings like scaling, rotation, etc. We need to correctly parse the command to extract only the filename.\n\n6. **Environment Wrapping**: Images can be included inside different environments, such as `figure`, `minipage`, or `subfigure`. We'll need to parse these environments correctly to get to the image files.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Environments**: Some LaTeX documents define their own commands or environments that internally use `\\includegraphics` or similar commands to include images. We'd have to be aware of these custom definitions to properly extract the filenames.\n\n8. **File Encoding and Special Characters**: The LaTeX file may contain special characters or be encoded in a way that is not straightforward to parse (e.g., Unicode characters, special LaTeX symbols).\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, it's important to clarify which of them we need to consider for the specific task at hand once we have access to the LaTeX source file."
