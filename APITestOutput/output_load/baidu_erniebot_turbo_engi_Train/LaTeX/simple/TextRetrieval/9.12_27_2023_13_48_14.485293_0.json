The parser needs to recognize all possible commands that can render text in bold.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text may be nested within other formatting commands or environments, like in italics, underlined text, or even within tables and custom environments. The parser should be able to handle nested structures without losing the context of the bold text.\n\n3. **Command Parameters**: Sometimes, bold commands can have optional parameters that don't necessarily contain the text meant to be bold, such as styling options. The parser should distinguish between optional parameters and the actual text content.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Code**: LaTeX comments start with `%` and go until the end of the line. Additionally, any code that's commented out should not be processed. Thus, the parser must ignore any text within comments when extracting bold texts.\n\n5. **Special Characters and Escaping**: LaTeX uses special characters like `{`, `}`, `&`, `%`, `$`, and others for formatting purposes. When they are part of the bold text, they must be handled correctly. Moreover, if these characters are escaped within the text (like `\\%`), the escape character must be considered.\n\n6. **Custom Styling Environments**: LaTeX allows users to define custom styling environments with `\\newenvironment`. Bold text might be inside such environments, which can complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Multiple Instances**: There may be multiple instances of bold text in the document, and all instances need to be extracted without duplication or omission.\n\n8. **Line Breaks and Whitespaces**: LaTeX is flexible with line breaks and whitespaces. The parser might encounter bold text that spans multiple lines or has unconventional whitespace patterns.\n\nThe parser needs to be designed to handle these potential issues in order to accurately extract all instances of bold text from a LaTeX file."
