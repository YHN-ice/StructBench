Identifying all such patterns is essential.\n\n2. **Nested Commands:** Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Custom Commands:** The document might define custom commands that result in bold text, which would require parsing of the preamble to identify these commands.\n\n4. **Comments and Inactive Blocks:** Bold text might be present within comments (`%`) or inactive blocks, which should not be extracted as they are not rendered in the final document.\n\n5. **Multiline and Broken Commands:** Bold commands might span multiple lines or be broken up by line breaks, complicating the pattern matching.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments:** Some LaTeX commands have optional arguments that need to be handled correctly.\n\n7. **Environment Use:** Bold text might also be produced by certain environments, so the parser needs to understand these contexts.\n\n8. **False Positives:** There could be false positives where the bold command is present but commented out or used in a different context not meant for formatting text.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, the parser would need to handle these scenarios and possibly more, depending on the complexity of the LaTeX document."
