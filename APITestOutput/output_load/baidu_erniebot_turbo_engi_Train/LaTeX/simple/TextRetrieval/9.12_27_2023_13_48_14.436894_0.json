Different commands for bold: In LaTeX, bold text can be indicated using different commands such as `\\textbf{...}`, `\\bfseries`, or even custom commands defined in the document preamble that wrap one of the standard bold commands.\n\n2. Nested formatting: Bold text may be nested within other formatting commands, such as italics or underlining, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. Braces balancing: The content within the `\\textbf{...}` command could include curly braces `{}` for various purposes, which need to be correctly balanced to extract the text properly.\n\n4. Command parameters: Some bold commands might have optional parameters that must be appropriately handled to avoid including them as part of the extracted text.\n\n5. Comments and whitespace: The LaTeX file might contain comments (using `%`) that should be ignored, and handling whitespace correctly is necessary to ensure clean and accurate extraction of the bold text.\n\n6. Environment usage: Bold text may be inside LaTeX environments that handle text formatting in blocks rather than inline, such as a `theorem` environment that is set to display text in bold.\n\n7. Custom environments and macros: The document might define custom macros or environments which change text to bold, without using standard bold commands. These would require specific knowledge of such customizations to extract their contents.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, parsing a LaTeX file for bold texts will require careful analysis of the syntax to ensure accurate extraction."
