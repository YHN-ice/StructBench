Recognizing all possible methods will be necessary.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n3. **Command parameters**: Some LaTeX commands may have optional parameters that need to be accounted for, as they may appear before the actual content that's bolded.\n\n4. **Custom commands and environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that change text to bold, which wouldn't be recognizable without interpreting the preamble or style files.\n\n5. **Comments**: Comments in LaTeX start with `%` and should not be considered as part of the content, but they could contain what appears to be bold-formatted text, which is not actually rendered in the final document.\n\n6. **Text spread over multiple lines**: The content within the `\\textbf{}` command might be spread over multiple lines, which would require handling line breaks in the parser.\n\n7. **Braces within braces**: The content within `\\textbf{}` might include additional curly braces for other LaTeX commands, which could make it harder to determine where the bold content starts and ends.\n\nTo address these challenges, the parser will need to have a robust understanding of LaTeX syntax, handle nesting and line breaks properly, and skip over comments and optional parameters without extracting them as part of the bold text."
