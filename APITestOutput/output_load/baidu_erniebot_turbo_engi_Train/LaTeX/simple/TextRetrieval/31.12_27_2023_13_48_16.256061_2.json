Without the extension, additional steps may be required to determine the actual file name.\n4. **Figure Environments**: Figures might be included inside different environments (e.g., `figure`, `subfigure`, etc.), and some documents might have custom commands or environments defined for including figures.\n5. **Comments**: Lines that are commented out should not be processed, as the figures on these lines are not actually included in the document.\n6. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments for scaling, rotating, etc., which need to be handled correctly to extract only the file name.\n7. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes a single command might include multiple figures, especially in the case of subfigures.\n\nOnce the input file is available, it will then be possible to parse it and apply logic to overcome these potential difficulties to extract the figure file names."
