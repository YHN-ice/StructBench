Additionally, the file extension might be omitted (LaTeX can infer it).\n\n3. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: The \\includegraphics command may be used within a figure environment that contains multiple figures (e.g., using subfigure or minipage environments).\n\n4. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Some documents define custom commands or environments that internally use \\includegraphics. These would require special handling.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX comments (% sign) might contain \\includegraphics-like text that should not be treated as actual command invocations.\n\n6. **Multiple Formats**: The figures might be in various formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf) and the parser should recognize all possible extensions.\n\n7. **Conditional Inclusion**: Some figures might be conditionally included using LaTeX if-conditions, which makes parsing more complex.\n\n8. **File Encoding**: If the LaTeX file has a non-standard encoding or uses special characters in filenames, it could pose additional challenges.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser must be robust enough to handle various syntaxes and LaTeX constructs while extracting the correct filenames."
