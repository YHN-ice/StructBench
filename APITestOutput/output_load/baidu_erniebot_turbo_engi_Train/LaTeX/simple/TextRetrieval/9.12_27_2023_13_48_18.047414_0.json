A bold command within a comment should not be considered.\n\n5. **Command Parameters**: The LaTeX file may use optional parameters with the bold commands that need to be ignored for text extraction, e.g., `\\textbf[option]{text}`.\n\n6. **Environment-based Formatting**: Some documents apply bold formatting by declaring an environment rather than directly wrapping text in a command, such as in a `{\\bfseries ... }` block.\n\n7. **Escaped Characters**: If the backslash or other LaTeX command characters are escaped within the document, the parser must handle them appropriately to avoid false positives or negatives.\n\n8. **Cross-line Commands**: Some LaTeX commands might span multiple lines, which could complicate the regex or parsing method used.\n\n9. **Fonts and Styles Packages**: The use of additional fonts or styles packages might alter the default behavior of bold commands and must be taken into account.\n\n10. **Handling Incomplete Documents**: The text could be part of an incomplete document where commands are not closed properly, making it difficult to parse.\n\nThese obstacles would require the parser to be robust and capable of handling a variety of LaTeX formatting scenarios to accurately extract all bold texts."
