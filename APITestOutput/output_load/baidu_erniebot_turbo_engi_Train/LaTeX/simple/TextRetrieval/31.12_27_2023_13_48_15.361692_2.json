Identifying all these commands would be essential.\n2. **Figure Path Variations**: Figures might be included with relative or absolute paths, and they might reside in different directories. Paths could also have various file extensions or no extension at all.\n3. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments before the actual filename (e.g., scale, width, height), which should be correctly parsed to extract the filename.\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` sign. Any include commands within comments should be ignored.\n5. **Inline Braces**: Filenames could be broken up with LaTeX commands inside braces, which can complicate extraction.\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Users might define custom macros which internally use standard include commands. Recognizing these requires parsing and understanding new macros or environments.\n7. **Multiple Files in One Command**: There may be commands that include multiple files at once, which would require splitting and extracting each filename individually.\n\nOnce we see the actual input file, we'll have a better idea of which of these potential issues we need to address to accurately extract the figure filenames."
