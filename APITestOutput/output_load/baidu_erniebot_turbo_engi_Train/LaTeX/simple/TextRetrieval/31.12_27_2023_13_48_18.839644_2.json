Each command may have its own syntax.\n\n2. **File Path Complexity**: The file paths for figures can be relative or absolute and can include directories. Sometimes, the paths are broken into multiple lines or concatenated with other LaTeX commands.\n\n3. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that change how the figure is included. These optional arguments come before the file name and need to be correctly ignored to extract the file name.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: LaTeX often allows including graphics without specifying the file extension, relying on the engine to find the correct file. Files can also have different extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf).\n\n5. **Commented Lines**: Lines that are commented out with `%` should not be considered as they do not result in included figures in the final document.\n\n6. **Non-Standard Inclusions**: Figures might be included within environments or commands that are not straightforward, such as within a `\\newcommand` definition or in a custom environment.\n\n7. **File Naming Conventions**: Some filenames may have spaces or other special characters that need to be handled correctly.\n\n8. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes multiple files are included within a single command, such as in a loop or a list passed to a custom command.\n\n9. **Environments**: Figures might be included inside environments (like `figure`), and one must parse the environment content correctly.\n\n10. **Error Handling**: The parser needs to handle errors and edge cases gracefully without crashing or providing incorrect output.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that could arise when trying to extract figure filenames from a LaTeX document.
