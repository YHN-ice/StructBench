These optional arguments must be correctly parsed to extract the file name.\n\n3. **File Path Variations**: The file path of the included graphics can be absolute or relative, and it may omit the file extension. The parser needs to handle these variations correctly.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Some LaTeX packages allow for subfigures within a single figure environment. These may involve multiple files included with separate commands.\n\n5. **Comments**: Parts of the LaTeX document may be commented out, including figure inclusion commands. These should not be considered when extracting file names.\n\n6. **Environment Confusion**: The `figure` environment doesn't necessarily mean a file is included there; it may contain inline drawings or no graphics at all.\n\n7. **Custom Commands**: Users can define their own commands that wrap standard LaTeX commands, which could be used to include graphics.\n\n8. **File Names with Spaces or Special Characters**: If file names contain spaces or special LaTeX characters, they need to be handled appropriately.\n\n9. **Macros and Variables**: File names could be constructed using LaTeX macros or variables which would need to be resolved.\n\n10. **Conditional Inclusions**: Figures might be included conditionally within `\\if` statements or other conditional LaTeX constructs.\n\n11. **Nested Includes**: Files included within other files might make the parsing process more complex if the complete document tree needs to be resolved.\n\nBefore parsing, we need to anticipate these potential issues and ensure that our approach can handle a variety of LaTeX code constructs to accurately extract figure file names."
