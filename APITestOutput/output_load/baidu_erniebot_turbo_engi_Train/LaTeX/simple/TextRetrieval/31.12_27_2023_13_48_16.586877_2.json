They might also lack file extensions if the LaTeX compiler is configured to automatically determine the file type.\n\n3. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes a single command might include multiple figures, possibly separated by commas or included in a loop or macro.\n\n4. **Comments and conditional inclusions**: Figures might be commented out or included conditionally within the LaTeX source, which means they should not always be extracted as existing figures.\n\n5. **Custom or complex environments**: Figures may be wrapped inside custom environments or commands that don't explicitly use standard LaTeX figure inclusion commands, making it hard to identify without understanding the custom definitions.\n\n6. **Optional arguments**: The \\includegraphics command can have optional arguments that change how the figure is included, such as its scale or rotation, which may appear before the file name and add complexity to the parsing.\n\n7. **Non-standard file extensions**: Some LaTeX documents may use non-standard or less common image file extensions, or even no extension at all, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\nTo deal with these potential difficulties, the parser must be robust enough to handle various inclusion commands, ignore comments and conditional code, manage file paths with and without extensions, and identify figures within custom environments."
