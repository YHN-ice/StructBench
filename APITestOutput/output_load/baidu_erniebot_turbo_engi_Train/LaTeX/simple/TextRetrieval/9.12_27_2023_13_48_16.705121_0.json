We need to identify all possible commands that can make text bold.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands or within themselves, which complicates the extraction process.\n\n3. **Special Characters**: LaTeX special characters or commands within the bold text could affect simple parsing, for instance, `{`, `}`, `&`, `%`, `$`, etc., which are used for different purposes in LaTeX.\n\n4. **Comments**: Content within comments (`%`) should be ignored, as it is not rendered in the final document.\n\n5. **Cross-line Bold Texts**: Bold text formatting may span multiple lines, which can be challenging to detect with a simple line-by-line parser.\n\n6. **Custom Commands**: The LaTeX document might define custom commands that handle bold text in a non-standard way.\n\n7. **Environment Conflicts**: The bold text might be within an environment that changes how text is processed, such as a verbatim environment where formatting commands are ignored.\n\n8. **Optional Arguments**: Some LaTeX commands accept optional arguments which can appear before the actual content to be made bold, potentially complicating the extraction.\n\nWe will need to develop a robust parsing strategy to handle these cases accurately to extract only the content that is intended to be displayed in bold within the compiled LaTeX document."
