They could have relative or absolute paths, and the parser must correctly extract just the file names if necessary.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX commands may or may not include the file extension of the image. The parser must be able to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Options in Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command and similar ones can have options inside `[]` which might include additional commas and brackets that should not be confused with the filename.\n\n5. **Commented Lines**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. If a figure include command is commented out, it should not be counted.\n\n6. **Multiple Files in One Command**: Sometimes, LaTeX commands may include more than one file within a single command, separated by commas; the parser needs to split them correctly.\n\n7. **Environment Context**: Figures might be included inside different environments, like `figure`, which might or might not affect their parsing.\n\n8. **Repetitions and Versions**: Some documents might include the same figure multiple times or have different versions (like for printing vs. online viewing).
