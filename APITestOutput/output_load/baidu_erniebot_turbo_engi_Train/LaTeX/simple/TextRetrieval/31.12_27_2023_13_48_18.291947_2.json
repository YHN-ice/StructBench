Paths might also contain spaces or special characters that need to be handled correctly.\n\n3. **Comments**: Some include commands might be commented out using the % symbol. These should not be counted as included figures.\n\n4. **Custom commands**: The document might define custom commands that include graphics, which would not be immediately recognizable without interpreting those definitions.\n\n5. **Figure environments**: Figures can be included within different environments (figure, figure*, sidewaysfigure, etc.), and the file paths could be part of complex parameters within these environments.\n\n6. **Options in includegraphics**: The \\includegraphics command can have options before the file path which might complicate the extraction of the file name alone.\n\n7. **Multiple files in one command**: Sometimes a command might include multiple files, especially when using wildcards or file list commands.\n\n8. **File extensions**: Some LaTeX compilers allow omitting the file extension when including graphics; thus, the parser must handle cases both with and without file extensions.\n\nTo ensure accuracy when extracting figure files, the parser must handle all these complexities.
