It is important to recognize all possible ways bold text may be implemented.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, such as italic, underline, or custom environments. Identifying the bold text within nested structures could be challenging.\n\n3. **Braces and special characters**: The LaTeX syntax uses braces `{}` to denote the scope of commands. Special characters, like backslashes or curly brackets, might be used within the bold text itself, complicating the extraction process.\n\n4. **Comments in LaTeX**: Text within comments (after `%` symbols) should not be extracted as they are not rendered in the final document. It's important to ignore anything that is commented out.\n\n5. **Complexity of LaTeX environments**: Bold text might be part of more complex environments like tables, lists, or custom-defined environments. It may require handling these environments properly to extract the bold text.\n\n6. **Line breaks and whitespace**: Line breaks and whitespace in LaTeX source files do not necessarily correspond to the layout in the rendered document. When extracting text, it may need to be processed to ensure it represents the content accurately.\n\nOnce provided with the input, these issues will need to be addressed to accurately extract and output the bold texts from the LaTeX file."
