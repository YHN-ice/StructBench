You'll have to account for all these possibilities.\n\n2. **Path Specifications**: The file paths for figures can be specified with absolute or relative paths and can include directories. The parser must correctly identify the file name regardless of the path complexity.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Sometimes the LaTeX file may omit the file extension for figures, relying on the LaTeX compiler to automatically detect it. The parser will need to handle cases where the file extension is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes a single command might include multiple figures, especially in the case of subfigures. This needs to be considered during parsing.\n\n5. **Comments and Conditional Inclusions**: LaTeX allows for comments (with `%`) and conditional compilation (with `\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`, etc.). The parser should ignore figures included in commented-out sections or in branches of conditionals that would not be compiled.\n\n6. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Users may define their own commands and environments to include figures, which may not follow the standard `\\includegraphics` syntax. If the LaTeX file uses such customizations, it becomes more challenging to extract figure file names unless these custom commands are predefined in the parsing logic.\n\nAssuming that the LaTeX file uses standard figure inclusion commands and does not include figures in comments or conditional compilation sections, I can proceed with extracting the figure file names based on common commands like `\\includegraphics`.
