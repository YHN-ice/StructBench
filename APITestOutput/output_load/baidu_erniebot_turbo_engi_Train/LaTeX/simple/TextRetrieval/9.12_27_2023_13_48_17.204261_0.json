Recognizing all possible ways to denote bold text is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might contain other formatting commands or environments nested inside it. It is important to extract only the text that is bold, without including any additional LaTeX commands.\n\n3. **Multi-line bold text**: Bold text might span multiple lines or even paragraphs. The parser should be able to handle cases where the bold formatting is not confined to a single line.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX files may contain comments that use the `%` symbol. If bold text occurs within a comment, it should not be considered as part of the extracted text.\n\n5. **Custom macros or environments**: The document might define custom macros or environments that change the text to bold. Without knowledge of these, the parser might miss some bold text.\n\n6. **Escaped characters**: Characters such as `{`, `}`, or `\\` might be escaped within the text, and the parser must recognize and handle these correctly.\n\n7. **Brace matching**: Since LaTeX uses `{}` for command arguments, the parser needs to correctly match opening and closing braces to extract the complete text within the bold command.\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, it's important for the parser to have a robust mechanism to accurately identify and extract bold texts from the document. Now we can proceed with examining the input file to extract the requested information."
