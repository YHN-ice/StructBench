Extracting text requires correctly matching opening and closing braces, even when they are nested.\n\n4. **Custom Commands or Macros**: The LaTeX file might have custom commands or macros defined that change the way text is formatted, which could affect how bold text is identified.\n\n5. **Comments and Conditionals**: Text within comments `%` should not be counted as part of the document. Also, conditional LaTeX commands might selectively apply bold formatting.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: Characters that are part of LaTeX syntax, such as `{`, `}`, or `\\`, might be escaped to display literally rather than indicate formatting; this needs to be handled correctly.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust parsing strategy that accounts for the different ways bold text can be encoded in LaTeX, as well as LaTeX's syntax rules, must be employed."
