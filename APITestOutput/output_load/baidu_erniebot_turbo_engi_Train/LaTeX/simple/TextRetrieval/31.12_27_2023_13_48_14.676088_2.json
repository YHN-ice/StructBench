We would need to identify all such commands used for including images.\n\n2. **Options in Include Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command may contain options before the filename, such as `[width=0.5\\textwidth]`. The parser must correctly identify the filename irrespective of such options.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: The file names in the LaTeX document may or may not include file extensions (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`). LaTeX allows for omitting the extension, and it will automatically search for the appropriate file types. We must handle both cases.\n\n4. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: File paths can be given as absolute or relative paths, and the parser needs to be able to handle both.\n\n5. **Commented Lines**: Lines in LaTeX can be commented out with the `%` character, meaning that they should not be processed. The parser must distinguish between active commands and commented lines.\n\n6. **Multiple Files in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple files, especially when using loops or custom commands. The parser must be able to handle these cases.\n\n7. **File Paths with Spaces**: File paths or names with spaces can be included in LaTeX with quotes or braces. The parser needs to account for such cases.\n\n8. **Nested Commands**: LaTeX allows for nesting commands within others, which could complicate the extraction of filenames.\n\n9. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Some documents define custom commands or environments that include graphics. Without knowing these custom definitions, it may be difficult to correctly extract filenames.\n\n10. **Different Environments**: Filenames could be included within different environments such as `figure`, `minipage`, etc., and the parser needs to be aware of these contexts.\n\nKnowing these potential obstacles can help in preparing a more robust parsing strategy. To provide an accurate list of filenames, the parser will need to address these issues effectively."
