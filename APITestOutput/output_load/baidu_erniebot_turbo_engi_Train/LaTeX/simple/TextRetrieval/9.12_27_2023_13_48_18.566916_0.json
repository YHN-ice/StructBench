In LaTeX, text is commonly made bold using the `\\textbf{}` command or within a `\\bfseries` scope.

Handling nested braces correctly is essential to extract the complete text.\n\n2. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document might define custom commands or environments that make text bold, which would require additional logic to handle.\n\n3. **Comments**: The LaTeX file might contain comments that include the `\\textbf{}` command, which should not be processed as they are not part of the actual document content.\n\n4. **Alternative Formatting Styles**: Different LaTeX classes or packages might offer alternative ways to bold text, such as `\\bf` (deprecated) or using a custom environment.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Broken Commands**: If the LaTeX file contains errors or incomplete commands (e.g., missing closing braces), it could complicate the parsing process.\n\n6. **Variation in Spacing**: Sometimes, spaces or newlines might appear within the command or around the braces, which should be considered while parsing the content.\n\n7. **Starred Versions of Commands**: Some commands have starred versions (e.g., `\\textbf*{}`) that might behave slightly differently and need to be handled.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, a robust LaTeX parser would be needed that can understand the context of the LaTeX commands and properly extract text that is meant to be bold."
