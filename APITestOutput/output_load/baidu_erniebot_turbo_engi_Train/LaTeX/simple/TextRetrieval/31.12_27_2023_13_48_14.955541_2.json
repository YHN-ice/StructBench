Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during the process:\n\n1. Different Commands: LaTeX allows several commands to include figures, such as `\\includegraphics`, `\\input`, and custom commands defined by the user. Identifying all possible commands used to include figures is necessary.\n\n2. Multiple Formats: Figures can be included in various file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf). Figuring out all possible formats included in the LaTeX file is essential.\n\n3. Path Information: Figures may be included with relative or absolute paths, or just by the file name if they reside in the same directory as the LaTeX file. Extracting the appropriate path information or discarding it might be necessary depending on the question's requirements.\n\n4. Optional Arguments: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that change the presentation of the figure (e.g., scale, width, height). It's important to differentiate between these options and the file name itself.\n\n5. Comments: File names could be present in commented lines, which should not be counted as included figures since they are not active in the document.\n\n6. Multiple Figures in One Command: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures (e.g., using a comma-separated list). Each file name should be extracted individually.\n\n7. File Name Variations: The same file might be included with different extensions or without an extension at all, and this should be handled correctly.\n\nOnce you provide the LaTeX input file, I will look for lines with commands that include figures and extract the relevant file names while considering these potential difficulties."
