Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise in this process:\n\n1. Different Commands: LaTeX supports multiple commands for including figures (e.g., \\includegraphics, \\epsfig, etc.), and these may have different syntaxes.\n\n2. Multiple Options: The \\includegraphics command can have many options that precede the actual filename, which might complicate the extraction if the parser does not correctly handle these options.\n\n3. File Path Formats: Figure file paths can be relative or absolute, and can use different directory separators (e.g., '/', '\\'). Filenames might also contain spaces or special characters that need to be accounted for.\n\n4. Multiple Figures in One Command: Sometimes a single command might include multiple figures, especially in the case of subfigures.\n\n5. File Extensions: LaTeX files often omit the file extension when including graphics as LaTeX is capable of automatically determining the correct file type. The parser must be prepared to handle this.\n\n6. Commented Out Lines: The parser must distinguish between active lines of code and those that are commented out, as commented lines should not be considered when extracting figure filenames.\n\n7. \\graphicspath Command: LaTeX allows for a global path setting for all graphics via the \\graphicspath command, which might affect how filenames are interpreted.\n\n8. Figure Environments: Figures might be included within different environments (figure, figure*, etc.) and could be nested within other commands or environments that might obscure direct parsing.\n\n9. Error Handling: The parser should be able to handle errors or unexpected input gracefully without crashing or producing incorrect output.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the parser needs to be robust and flexible to handle various LaTeX coding styles and scenarios."
