The parser must be able to recognize all the variations.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other LaTeX commands or environments, which could complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Brace matching**: Since LaTeX uses braces `{}` to indicate the scope of commands, the parser must correctly match opening and closing braces, even when nested.\n\n4. **Custom commands and environments**: A LaTeX file might define custom commands or environments that internally use one of the bold text commands. The parser must recognize these as well.\n\n5. **Comments**: The LaTeX file may contain comments (lines starting with `%`) that could include bold commands that should not be executed or extracted.\n\n6. **Conditional text**: The file might contain conditional statements that could affect whether text is bold or not, and this could complicate extraction.\n\n7. **Inline vs. Block**: Bold text could be present in both inline text and within different blocks like figure captions, tables, etc. The parser should handle both cases.\n\n8. **Escape characters**: Special characters (like `%`, `{`, `}`, `&`, etc.) may be escaped within the LaTeX code, and the parser must handle these correctly.\n\n9. **Multiple bold sections in one command**: A command may contain multiple sections of bold text separated by plain text.\n\n10. **Text spanning multiple lines**: Bold text might span across multiple lines, and the parser should concatenate these lines properly.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust parsing strategy to accurately extract only the relevant bold text segments from the LaTeX file content. Now, please provide the LaTeX file content so I can attempt to extract the bold texts for you."
