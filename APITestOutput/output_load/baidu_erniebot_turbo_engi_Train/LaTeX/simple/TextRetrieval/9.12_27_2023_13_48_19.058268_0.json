The parser needs to recognize all possible bold commands.\n\n2. **Nested commands:** Bold text might be within other formatting commands or environments, and the parser must handle nested structures.\n\n3. **Custom commands:** A document might define custom commands for bold text that the parser is not initially aware of.\n\n4. **Inline braces:** Braces `{}` are used in LaTeX for grouping and scope. They might be present within the bold text for other reasons, complicating the extraction.\n\n5. **Comments:** The LaTeX file might have comments that include bold commands that should not be extracted.\n\n6. **Multi-line text:** Bold text might span multiple lines, and the parser must handle line breaks correctly.\n\n7. **Math mode:** Bold text inside math mode is handled differently (e.g., `\\mathbf{}`), and the parser needs to distinguish between text and math modes.\n\n8. **Escaped characters:** Commands might be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being parsed, and these should not be extracted as bold text.\n\nTo correctly extract bold texts, the parser must address these potential issues comprehensively."
