The parser must recognize all these commands.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Parameter Braces**: Bold commands have parameters enclosed in braces `{}`. Ensuring that the correct text is extracted without including unwanted braces or missing text with nested braces is important.\n\n4. **Line Breaks and Whitespaces**: Bold text might span multiple lines or contain line breaks and additional whitespaces that should be handled properly.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol; any bold text within comments should not be extracted.\n\n6. **Custom Environments**: If the LaTeX file defines custom environments that change text to bold, it would be necessary to recognize these too.\n\n7. **Incomplete or Broken Commands**: The LaTeX file might have errors or incomplete commands, which could lead to incorrect extraction.\n\n8. **Special Characters**: Special LaTeX characters or commands within the bold text need to be handled correctly, so they are not mistaken for LaTeX syntax outside of the text intended to be bold.\n\nI'll need to see the actual LaTeX content to determine the correct approach for extracting the bold texts while addressing these potential issues."
