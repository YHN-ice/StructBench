Identifying all of these requires knowledge of the specific LaTeX document.\n\n2. **Environment handling**: Bold text might be within different environments, such as `itemize`, `enumerate`, or custom environments. How to handle these environments needs to be considered.\n\n3. **Nested commands**: Bold commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which may complicate extraction.\n\n4. **Comments**: Text within comments (`% some comment`) should not be considered as part of the document, and hence, bold text within comments should be ignored.\n\n5. **Custom macros**: If the document defines custom macros for bold text, we need to identify these macros to extract the text.\n\n6. **Brace matching**: Since LaTeX uses `{}` to delimit the scope of commands, it’s necessary to correctly match braces when extracting text.\n\n7. **Non-standard packages**: Some documents may use packages that define additional or non-standard ways to bold text which could be missed if only looking for the common commands.\n   \nTo accurately parse and extract bold texts from a LaTeX file, these issues must be taken into account.
