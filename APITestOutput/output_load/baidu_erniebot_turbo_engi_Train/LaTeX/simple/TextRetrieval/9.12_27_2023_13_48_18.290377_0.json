Recognizing all possible variants is necessary.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text might be nested within other commands or environments, which could complicate the extraction process. For example, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{important} text}` has italic text nested within bold text.\n\n3. **Line breaks**: The bold text might contain line breaks or be split over multiple lines, which might necessitate handling multi-line patterns.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX comments (anything following a `%` on a line) could contain what looks like commands for bold text but should not be included in the output.\n\n5. **Brace matching**: Properly matching curly braces `{}` is essential for correctly identifying the argument to the bold command, especially if there are multiple levels of braces.\n\n6. **Custom environments**: Sometimes documents define custom environments or commands that change text to bold, so without knowledge of these definitions, it may be challenging to identify all bold text.\n\n7. **Math mode**: Bold commands within math mode (e.g., `\\mathbf{}` or `\\boldsymbol{}`) have different semantics and may or may not be relevant depending on the context of the question.\n\nEach of these potential issues would need to be addressed in parsing the LaTeX file to ensure accurate and complete extraction of the bold texts."
