The parser may need to handle these cases, possibly by assuming default extensions or searching for existing files.\n4. **Relative and Absolute Paths**: Figures might be included using relative or absolute paths, and the parser should be able to handle both (e.g., `figures/file.png` vs `/home/user/documents/figures/file.png`).\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Some LaTeX packages allow including multiple figures in one command, potentially complicating the extraction process.\n6. **Comments**: Figures might be commented out in the LaTeX source, and a simple extraction process could mistakenly include these commented-out figures.\n7. **Custom Commands**: A user might define custom commands that internally use standard LaTeX commands to include figures, which could obscure the actual file names from a naive parser.\n8. **Environment Usage**: Figures may be included inside environments (like `figure` or `minipage`), and some environments might modify the context in which files are included.\n\nHaving these potential difficulties in mind, I will look for commands like `\\includegraphics`, accounting for variations in command usage, to extract the figure file names."
