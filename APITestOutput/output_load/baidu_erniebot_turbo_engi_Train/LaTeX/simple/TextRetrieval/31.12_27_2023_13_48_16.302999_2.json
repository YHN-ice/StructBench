The parser must handle both cases.\n\n4. **Options in Include Commands**: There could be optional arguments within the include commands that do not pertain to the filename but modify how the figure is displayed (e.g., width, height, scale). These should not be confused with filenames.\n\n5. **Comments and Unusual Syntax**: LaTeX allows comments with `%`, and filenames included within such commented lines should not be extracted. Also, there may be custom macros or unusual syntax that could make parsing more difficult.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes a single command might include multiple figures, especially in the case of subfigures or when using loops.\n\n7. **Environment Variations**: Figures can be included in different environments, and some might nest within others. The parser must correctly handle such nesting.\n\n8. **Curly Braces and Other Characters**: Filenames could contain special characters, spaces or be wrapped in additional curly braces for grouping which should be correctly interpreted.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, the actual parsing logic must be carefully crafted to accurately identify and extract the figure filenames from the LaTeX document."
