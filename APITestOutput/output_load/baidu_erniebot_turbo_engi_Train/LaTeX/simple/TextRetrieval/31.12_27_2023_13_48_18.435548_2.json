Parsing these correctly to extract just the file name might be challenging.\n\n3. **File Extensions**: Some LaTeX commands might include the file extension, while others might omit it (relying on the LaTeX compiler to find the correct file). We need to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Options in Include Graphics**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options before the file name, like `[width=0.5\\textwidth]`. These options should not be confused with the file path/name.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using `%`. Any include commands within comments should not be considered.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, multiple figures are included within a single command, especially within a figure environment. This requires careful parsing to extract each file name.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Environments**: Users might define their own commands to include figures or wrap `\\includegraphics` into a custom environment. Recognizing these would depend on understanding the user's macro definitions.\n\n8. **Figure Variants**: Sometimes figures are included with variants for different compilation modes (such as draft or final versions), which could complicate the extraction.\n\n9. **Encoding and Special Characters**: File names could have special characters that are encoded differently in LaTeX, such as spaces or underscores.\n\n10. **Error Handling**: The given LaTeX might contain syntax errors which could lead to incorrect parsing if not handled properly.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in developing a robust approach for parsing LaTeX files and extracting figure file names accurately."
