Custom Macros: The document may define custom macros that result in bold text, which would not be caught by simply looking for `\\textbf{}` or `{\\bfseries}`.\n3. Environment Overrides: Bold text might be applied through environments or scope changes that set a certain region of text to be bold without explicitly marking each segment with `\\textbf{}`.\n4. Comments and Inactive Code: Bold commands may appear within comments or inactive parts of the code, which should not be included in the output.\n5. Variations in Syntax: There may be variations in how bold is applied, such as different braces/brackets or even custom-defined commands that encapsulate the `\\textbf{}` command.\n6. Encoded or Escaped Characters: The LaTeX file might contain encoded characters within the `\\textbf{}` command that need proper decoding to extract the intended text.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, we would need to parse it while considering these potential challenges to ensure accurate extraction of all bold texts."
