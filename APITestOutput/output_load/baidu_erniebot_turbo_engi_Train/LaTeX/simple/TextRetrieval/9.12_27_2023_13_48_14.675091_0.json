We need to identify which commands are used in the file.\n\n2. **Nested formatting**: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands, such as italics or underline. Parsing these correctly to extract only the bold text can be challenging.\n\n3. **Environment-specific bolding**: Bold text might be within environments that change text properties, like `itemize`, `enumerate`, or custom-defined environments.\n\n4. **Inline versus block commands**: Bold text could be applied inline within a paragraph or applied to entire blocks of text, possibly spanning multiple lines.\n\n5. **Comments and other LaTeX features**: Comments in LaTeX begin with `%` and should be ignored. Additionally, LaTeX may include custom commands defined in the preamble or elsewhere that could change how bold is applied.\n\n6. **Math mode**: Bold text within math mode might use different commands like `\\mathbf{}` or `\\boldsymbol{}` that need to be identified separately.\n\n7. **Multi-line and parameter parsing**: Bold commands might span across multiple lines, or include parameters that aren't part of the intended bold text.\n\n8. **Conditional formatting**: Sometimes, text formatting is conditionally applied based on certain LaTeX boolean flags or commands.\n\nTo correctly extract all bold texts, the parser has to handle all of these scenarios without getting confused by non-bold text or other formatting that might be present in the LaTeX file."
