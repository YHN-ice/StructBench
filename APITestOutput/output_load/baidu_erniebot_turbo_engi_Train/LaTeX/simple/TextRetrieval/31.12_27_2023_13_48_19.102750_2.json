The parser needs to handle different path specifications correctly.\n\n3. **File extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include figures without specifying the file extension (relying on the LaTeX compiler to locate the file); other times, the extension is specified. The parser should be able to handle both cases.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` symbol. Any figure file included on a line that is commented out should not be extracted.\n\n5. **Multiple figures in one command**: It's possible to include multiple figures within one command, especially within a figure environment or when using subfigures. The parser needs to distinguish these and extract each file name separately.\n\n6. **Options within include commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options within square brackets before the file name, which should not be confused with the file name itself.\n\n7. **Custom commands or macros**: The LaTeX document might define custom commands or macros that wrap around the `\\includegraphics` command, making it difficult to directly search for the standard commands.\n\n8. **Uncommon packages**: There might be packages used which change the syntax for including figures or add new ways to do it.\n\n9. **File name with spaces or special characters**: File names may contain spaces or special characters, and these must be correctly parsed to extract the exact file name.\n\n10. **Conditional inclusion**: There might be conditional statements in the LaTeX document that include figures only if certain conditions are met (using `\\if`, `\\ifdef`, etc.).\n\nConsidering these potential difficulties, the parser must be designed comprehensively to deal with these scenarios to accurately extract all figure file names."
