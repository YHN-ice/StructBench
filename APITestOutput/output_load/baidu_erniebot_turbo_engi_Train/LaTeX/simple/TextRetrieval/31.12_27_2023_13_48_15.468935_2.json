This will require careful parsing to extract each file name.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX users might comment out lines, including those that contain `\\includegraphics` commands. I'll need to ignore commented lines to ensure only active figures are extracted.\n\n5. **Custom commands or environments**: Users sometimes define custom commands or environments that internally include figures.
