We need to consider this when extracting file names.\n\n3. **File Paths**: Figures could be included from different directories, so the file paths could be relative or absolute. We need to correctly parse these paths to extract just the file names if required.\n\n4. **Options in Commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command and others can have options that may include brackets `[]` before the actual file name. These should not be mistaken for file names.\n\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX files can contain comments, which start with `%`. If a figure inclusion command is commented out, it should not be considered.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures, especially in environments like `figure` with subfigures or custom commands for multiple files.\n\n7. **Command Redefinitions**: In LaTeX, it's possible that standard commands are redefined to do something other than their default behavior. This could mislead the parser if it only looks for standard commands.\n\n8. **Complex Environments**: Figures might be included within complex environments or nested within other commands, which can make parsing challenging.\n\n9. **Groupings and Scopes**: The use of braces `{}` in LaTeX to group content and define scope could affect how file names are extracted.\n\n10. **Conditional Compilation**: Parts of the LaTeX document, including figure inclusions, might be conditionally compiled with `\\if` statements or similar constructs.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we need a robust parsing approach that understands LaTeX syntax and can discern between actual figure inclusions and other text or commands in the document."
