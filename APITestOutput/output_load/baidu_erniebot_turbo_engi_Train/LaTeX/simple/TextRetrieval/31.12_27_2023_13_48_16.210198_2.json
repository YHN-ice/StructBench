LaTeX comments start with `%`, and anything following it on the same line is ignored by LaTeX.\n\n3. **Multiple Figures on One Line**: There could be multiple commands on a single line, which would require parsing the line to extract each file separately.\n\n4. **File Paths**: The file names could include directories, and we need to decide if we want to extract the full path or just the file name.\n\n5. **Options in Includegraphics**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have options between square brackets before the file name; these need to be properly ignored to extract the file name.\n\n6. **Different File Extensions**: LaTeX does not require the file extension to be present, so some included graphics might not have an extension, or there could be multiple files with the same base name but different extensions.\n\n7. **File Names with Spaces or Special Characters**: File names or paths with spaces or special characters might be enclosed in double braces or use other LaTeX conventions to handle these cases.\n\n8. **Nested Includes**: Files included inside other LaTeX documents imported via `\\input` or `\\include` commands would not be directly visible in the root document.\n\nTo address these challenges, a parser needs to be robust enough to handle different variations of how figures can be included in LaTeX documents and must consider LaTeX syntax rules and conventions carefully."
