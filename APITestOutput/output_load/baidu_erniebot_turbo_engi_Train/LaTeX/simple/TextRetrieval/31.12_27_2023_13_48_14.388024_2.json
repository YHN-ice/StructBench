The parser must be prepared to handle both cases.\n\n3. **Relative and Absolute Paths:** The figures might be included using relative paths (e.g., `figures/image1.png`) or absolute paths (e.g., `/home/user/documents/figures/image1.png`). The parser should ideally extract the file names irrespective of the path type.\n\n4. **Multiple Figures in One Command:** The LaTeX document could include multiple figures within a single command or environment, such as in a `figure` environment with subfigures. The parser needs to identify all the file names.\n\n5. **Comments and Environment Detection:** File names could be commented out in the LaTeX source code or placed in environments that are not currently being used (like conditional statements). The parser needs to ignore such scenarios.\n\n6. **Options Inside Commands:** There can be additional options inside the figure commands, like scaling, rotation, etc., which must not be confused with the file name.\n\n7. **Custom Commands or Macros:** The document might use custom commands or macros to include figures, which makes parsing more complex, as the custom command definitions need to be interpreted to find the actual file names.\n\nGiven these potential challenges, an effective parser would need to be robust and account for these variations and complexities within LaTeX documents."
