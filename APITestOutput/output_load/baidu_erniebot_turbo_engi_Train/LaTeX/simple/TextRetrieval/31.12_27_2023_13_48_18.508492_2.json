The file path itself can be enclosed in curly braces.\n\n3. **File Path Formats**: The file paths may be relative or absolute, and they might not include the file extension (since LaTeX can often determine the extension automatically). The parser will have to handle all these variants.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments using the `%` character. Anything following this character on a line is ignored by LaTeX. The parser must disregard commented lines.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes figures are included using a single command but with multiple file names. For example, the command may include subfigures each with its own file.\n\n6. **Custom Macros or Environments**: The document may define custom macros for including figures, which would require understanding these macros' definitions to correctly extract figure file names.\n\n7. **Complex Environments**: Figures might be included within complex environments like `figure`, `minipage`, or user-defined environments that require specific parsing logic to correctly identify included files.\n\n8. **File Names with Special Characters**: File names may contain special characters or spaces that are handled with quotes or other LaTeX specific syntax.\n\nTo handle these difficulties effectively, the parser must be designed to recognize and process the various ways figures can be included and deal with the LaTeX syntax nuances accurately."
