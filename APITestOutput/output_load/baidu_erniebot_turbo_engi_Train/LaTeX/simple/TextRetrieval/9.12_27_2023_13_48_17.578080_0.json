One needs to identify all the possible commands that denote bold text.\n\n2. **Nested commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands or environments, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Broken across lines**: The command for bold text or its argument might be broken across lines or include line breaks, which can make it tricky to parse.\n\n4. **Comments and exclusions**: Bold text within comments (`%`) should be ignored since they are not rendered in the final document.\n\n5. **Curly braces balancing**: LaTeX uses curly braces `{}` for grouping, so it's important to parse matching pairs of braces correctly, especially when they are nested.\n\n6. **Custom commands in preamble**: Sometimes, bold text is defined via custom commands in the LaTeX preamble. These would need to be identified before parsing the main document body.\n\n7. **Math mode**: Text within math mode indicated by `$...$`, `\\[...\\]`, `\\(...\\)` or other math environments may use different commands for bolding (like `\\mathbf{}`) and should be handled based on context.\n\nTo address these challenges, a LaTeX parser must be robust enough to handle various syntaxes and conventions used for denoting bold text in LaTeX documents. Now, you can provide the LaTeX file content for extraction."
