For example, `\\textbf{This is \\emph{important}}` contains emphasized text inside bold text.\n\n3. **Custom Commands and Environments**: Users can define custom macros that may change the way bold text is handled. A parser must be aware of these customizations to accurately extract bold text.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX comments, indicated by `%`, should be ignored by the parser. Text within comments should not be extracted even if it appears to be formatted as bold.\n\n5. **Conditional Formatting**: Sometimes, the formatting is applied conditionally with the use of LaTeX conditionals (`\\if`, `\\else`, `\\fi`). Parsing the correct text might depend on understanding these conditions.\n\n6. **Multi-line Commands**: Bold text commands may span multiple lines, which might require multiline pattern matching or contextual parsing.\n\nGiven these potential obstacles, the parser needs to be robust enough to handle various scenarios while accurately extracting only the text intended to be bold."
