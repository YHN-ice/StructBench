The parser must recognize all possible methods.\n4. **Comments and Disabled Code**: Bold text within comments (`%`) or in disabled code blocks should not be considered, but detecting and excluding these can be challenging.\n5. **Escaped Characters**: In LaTeX, curly braces are escaped with a backslash (`\\{` and `\\}`). These should not be confused with actual command arguments.\n\nGiven these potential issues, the parser must be robust enough to handle a variety of cases where bold text could be defined or used within the LaTeX document.
