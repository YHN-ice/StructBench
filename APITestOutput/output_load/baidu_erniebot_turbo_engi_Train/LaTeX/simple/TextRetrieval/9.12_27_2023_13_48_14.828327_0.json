Each of these needs to be identified and handled correctly.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands might be nested within other formatting commands, or vice versa, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. **Custom Macros**: The LaTeX document might define custom macros that result in bold text, so without the definitions of those macros, it would be hard to know what text they affect.\n\n4. **Environment Blocks**: Bold text might be within environment blocks like `figure`, `table`, or custom-defined environments, which could require additional logic to parse.\n\n5. **Bracket Matching**: Correctly matching opening and closing braces `{}` is essential to extract the complete text that is meant to be bold.\n\n6. **Conditional Text**: LaTeX can include conditional logic that might change whether or not text is bold based on certain conditions. This would be hard to parse correctly without evaluating those conditions.\n\n7. **Comments and Inactive Code**: Comments (`%`) or code that is commented out should not be included in the extraction but might contain bold text-like patterns.\n\n8. **Line Breaks and White Spaces**: Handling line breaks and white spaces in LaTeX can be tricky since they may appear inside the curly braces of bold commands or in the surrounding text.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it's important to approach the LaTeX file parsing with careful consideration of the LaTeX syntax and formatting commands."
