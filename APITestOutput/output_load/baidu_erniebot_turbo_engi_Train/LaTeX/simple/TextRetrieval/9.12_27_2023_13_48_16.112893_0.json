Here are some possible difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Nested commands**: Bold text might have nested commands inside it, such as italic (\\textit{}), underline (\\underline{}), or any other formatting command. It's important to ensure that only the bold part is extracted, without the nested formatting commands if they are not part of the requirement.\n\n2. **Custom commands**: The LaTeX file might define custom commands that internally use `\\textbf{}` or `\\bfseries`, which means we would need to recognize these custom commands as producing bold text.\n\n3. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. If the `\\textbf{}` command is commented out, it should not be considered as bold text.\n\n4. **Environment-based bolding**: The `\\bfseries` command works differently from `\\textbf{}` as it affects all subsequent text until the end of the group or environment. This can make parsing more complex because we need to understand the scope within which the text is bolded.\n\n5. **Alternative bolding methods**: There might be other ways of making text bold in LaTeX, such as using the `\\boldmath` command for mathematical expressions or defining a new environment that implicitly makes its content bold.\n\n6. **Multiple instances**: There may be multiple instances of bold text in one line, which all need to be extracted.\n\n7. **Split commands**: Sometimes, LaTeX commands can be split across lines or have optional arguments that can make parsing more difficult.\n\nI will need to see the actual input file to provide a precise answer to what the bold texts are."
