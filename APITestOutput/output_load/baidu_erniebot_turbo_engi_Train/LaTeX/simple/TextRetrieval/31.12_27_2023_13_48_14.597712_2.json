The parser needs to recognize all possible variants.\n2. **Relative and absolute paths**: Figures might be included using either relative or absolute paths, and the parser should be able to handle both.\n3. **File extensions**: Some LaTeX editors or compilers allow for omitting the file extension of graphics. The parser should consider this and be able to extract the file name without an extension, or handle multiple extensions.\n4. **Multiple figures in one command**: There could be commands that include multiple figures at once, such as with subfigures, and the parser should extract each file name separately.\n5. **Comments**: LaTeX allows for comments with the `%` symbol. If a figure inclusion line is commented out, the parser should ideally ignore it.\n6. **Custom commands**: A user might create a custom command that wraps around the `\\includegraphics` command. The parser should be prepared to handle such cases if they are defined before their usage in the document.\n7. **Options within commands**: The `\\includegraphics` command and the `figure` environment can contain several options inside brackets before the file name is mentioned. The parser needs to correctly identify the file name within these options.\n8. **File paths with spaces**: File paths including spaces need special treatment as they may be enclosed in `{}` within LaTeX commands.\n\nTo handle these challenges effectively, the parser should have a flexible pattern matching system, perhaps using regular expressions, to accurately identify and extract figure file names from the LaTeX source code."
