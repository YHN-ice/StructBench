Different syntax options: The `\\includegraphics` command has options for including figures that can alter the syntax, such as specifying the width, height, or other attributes.\n3. File path variations: Figures can be included with relative or absolute paths, and with or without file extensions. These variations need to be accounted for when extracting file names.\n4. Commented lines: Lines that include figure files may be commented out with `%`. These should not be extracted as they are not active in the final document.\n5. Figure environments: Figures can be wrapped in different environments (e.g., `figure`, `figure*`, `minipage`), which might complicate the extraction process.\n6. Multiple figures in one command: Sometimes, multiple figures are included in a single command, especially within a figure environment using subfigures.
