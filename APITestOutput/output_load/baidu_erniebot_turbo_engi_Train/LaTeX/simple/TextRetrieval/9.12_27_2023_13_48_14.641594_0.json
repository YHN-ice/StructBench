Different commands for bold: In LaTeX, bold text can be created using different commands, such as `\\textbf{}`, `\\bfseries`, and even custom commands if they are defined in the document preamble. One needs to identify all possible ways bold text is introduced.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text might be nested within other formatting commands, or other formatting commands might be nested within bold text, which can complicate extraction.\n\n3. Brackets and braces balancing: Correctly identifying the beginning and end of the command's argument, especially when braces are nested, is crucial.\n\n4. Environment handling: Bold text might also be contained within environments (e.g., `\\begin{itemize}`) that have their own formatting. It's necessary to recognize and properly handle these environments.\n\n5. Incomplete or malformed commands: In cases where the LaTeX code is incomplete or contains errors, it might be difficult or impossible to accurately extract the intended text.\n\n6. Custom macros: The document may define custom macros that generate bold text, and without executing these macros, it may not be possible to recognize that text should be bold.\n\n7. Comments and non-executed code: Text within comments or within conditional statements that aren't executed should not be extracted, but distinguishing these cases can be tricky.\n\nBased on these potential difficulties, an accurate LaTeX parser would need to be quite sophisticated to handle all possible situations. However, in many practical cases, assuming well-formed and consistent LaTeX code using common conventions (like `\\textbf{}`) may be sufficient for extracting bold texts."
