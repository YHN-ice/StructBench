Different commands for bold: LaTeX has multiple commands that can make text bold, such as `\\textbf{}`, `\\bf{}`, or even a custom command defined in the preamble. Identifying all possible variants is necessary.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text might be nested within other commands or environments, making it harder to parse without a proper LaTeX parser. For example, `\\textbf{Some \\emph{important} text}`.\n\n3. Comments and escaped characters: Text that appears to be bold may actually be commented out with `%` or use escaped characters, like `{\\textbf\\{Not bold\\}}`, which should not be extracted as bold text.\n\n4. Environment-based bolding: Text might be inside an environment that changes text to bold without the explicit `\\textbf{}` command, such as in `\\begin{thebibliography}` where entries are commonly bold.\n\n5. Custom macros: LaTeX allows users to define their own macros, which may include commands to bold text. Without knowing these macros, it can be hard to identify all bolded text.\n\n6. Conditional formatting: The document could use conditional statements (like `\\ifthenelse`) that make the text bold only if certain conditions are met.\n\n7. Incomplete or broken tags: Sometimes LaTeX files may have syntax errors or incomplete tags, which could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\nFor each extracted piece of text, it will be essential to ensure that it is indeed meant to be displayed as bold in the final document and is not part of a comment, escaped sequence, or conditional statement that would prevent it from being displayed as such."
