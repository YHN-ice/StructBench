It might also include spaces or special characters that are sometimes enclosed in curly braces.\n\n3. **Multiple File Extensions**: The parser might have to consider different file extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .pdf, etc.), and sometimes LaTeX files omit the file extension in the `\\includegraphics` command.\n\n4. **Commented Lines**: If the `\\includegraphics` command is commented out with a `%`, that line should be ignored by the parser.\n\n5. **Custom Commands or Environments**: The document could define custom commands or environments that wrap `\\includegraphics`, making it harder to extract figure file names directly without knowing these definitions.\n\n6. **File Inclusion Commands Other Than `\\includegraphics`**: Other commands like `\\input` for including other LaTeX files or `\\include` for including whole chapters might not necessarily refer to figures but could be mistakenly parsed as such if not handled correctly.\n\nThe parser has to be designed to correctly navigate these challenges to accurately extract the names of the figure files included in the given LaTeX file."
