We need to identify all such commands that could be used to include images.\n\n2. **Path Variations**: The path to the image files can be specified in multiple ways, including relative paths, absolute paths, and paths with variables or LaTeX commands. We need to be able to handle all these variations.\n\n3. **Comments**: Figures included within comments (lines starting with `%`) should not be considered as they are not actually included in the final document.\n\n4. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command might have optional arguments that could include additional brackets before the file name, which need to be correctly parsed to extract the file name.\n\n5. **File Extensions**: LaTeX can include images without specifying the file extension. The parser must be prepared to handle such cases where the file extension may be omitted.\n\n6. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures, especially in cases where subfigures are used.\n\n7. **Graphics Packages**: Different LaTeX documents might use different packages for including graphics, and each package might have its own syntax for including images.\n\n8. **Complex File Names**: File names can include spaces, special characters, or even LaTeX commands, which can complicate the extraction process.\n\n9. **Figure Environments**: Figures might be wrapped inside `figure` environments or other custom environments that could affect how the figure is included.\n\n10. **Conditional Inclusion**: Figures might be included conditionally using LaTeX if-else constructs, making it necessary to interpret the condition to determine whether a figure is actually included or not.\n\nEach of these potential obstacles will require specific handling in the LaTeX file parsing logic to accurately extract all figure file names.
