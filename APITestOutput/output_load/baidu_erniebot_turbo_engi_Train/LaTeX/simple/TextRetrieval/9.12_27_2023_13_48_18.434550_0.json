Identifying all possible variations for bold text is essential.\n\n2. Nested commands: Bold text commands can be nested within other formatting commands, such as within an italicized sentence or a footnote. Properly identifying the start and end of the bold text in these scenarios can be challenging.\n\n3. Custom Commands: Users can define custom commands that result in bold text, which may not be immediately apparent without knowledge of the preamble or style files used.\n\n4. Comments: Text that appears to be bold within comments (lines starting with `%`) should not be extracted as they are not rendered in the final document.\n\n5. Environments: Bold text within certain environments might require special handling, for instance, within a `verbatim` environment where LaTeX commands are not processed.\n\n6. Broken Commands: If a LaTeX command is split across lines or has a syntax error, it may not be clear that the intention was to create bold text.\n\n7. Encoded Characters: Special characters or non-ASCII characters might be encoded in a way that complicates simple parsing.\n\nWhen approaching the parsing task, one must consider these potential issues and ensure that the parser is robust enough to handle the intricacies of LaTeX formatting commands."
