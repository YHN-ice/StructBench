We need to handle both cases.\n4. **Multiple figures in one command**: There might be commands that include multiple figures within a single line (such as in a figure array).\n5. **Commented out lines**: Lines that include figure path comments should not be counted. LaTeX treats anything after a `%` as a comment until the end of the line.\n6. **Complex environments**: Figures might be included inside complex environments or custom commands, which may require context-aware parsing to handle correctly.\n7. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments (such as scale, width, height) before the actual file path, which might complicate the extraction process.\n\nWhile processing the input, we will need to ensure that we accurately account for these potential issues in order to extract the correct figure file names."
