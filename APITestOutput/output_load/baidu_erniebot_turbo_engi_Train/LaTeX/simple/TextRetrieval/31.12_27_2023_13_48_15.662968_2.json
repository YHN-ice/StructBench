We must recognize all possible commands that could be used to include a figure.\n\n2. **Command Options**: Commands like `\\includegraphics` can have options that change their behavior. We need to parse these options correctly without mistaking them for filenames.\n\n3. **File Paths**: The figures might not be in the same directory as the LaTeX file. The filenames might include relative or absolute paths, which we need to handle correctly.\n\n4. **File Extensions**: Sometimes LaTeX files include the file extension of the figure, and sometimes they don't. We might need to account for both cases.\n\n5. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command may include multiple figures (e.g., in subfigure environments), we need to extract all such filenames.\n\n6. **Commented Lines**: Lines that are commented out should not be considered, as they are not part of the final document.\n\n7. **Complex Environments**: Figures might be included inside complex environments or user-defined macros, which would require more nuanced parsing logic.\n\nThese are some potential issues we'd have to address while parsing a LaTeX file to extract figure filenames.
