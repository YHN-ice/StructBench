Nested Commands: Bold text might have other formatting commands nested inside it, such as italics (`\\textit{...}`) or underline (`\\underline{...}`), which could complicate extraction.\n2. Custom Commands: The LaTeX file might define custom commands that internally use `\\textbf{...}` but don't look like the standard bold command at first glance.\n3. Environment Usage: Bold text could be inside environments that change the font to bold, such as `{\\bfseries ...}` or a custom environment defined in the preamble.\n4. Comments and Inactive Text: The bold command might be commented out or used inside a conditional block that isn't active, meaning it shouldn't be treated as bold text in the final document.\n5. Split Commands: The command to make text bold could be split across lines or have line breaks within the braces, making it harder to parse correctly.\n6. Special Characters: Special characters inside the bold text might need special handling, such as escaping certain characters or dealing with LaTeX reserved characters like `%`, `&`, `{`, `}`, etc.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, a careful approach must be taken to ensure accurate extraction of all and only the intended bold text from the LaTeX file."
