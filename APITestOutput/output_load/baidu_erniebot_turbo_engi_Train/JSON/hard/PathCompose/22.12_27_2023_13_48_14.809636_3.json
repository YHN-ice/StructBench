        "Based on the input JSON file and the potential difficulties and obstacles, here's a method you can use to access the value \"c\":\n\n1. Determine the correct path to the desired value: The JSON file has a nested structure, so you need to determine the correct path to the desired value. For example, you can use \"obj[key or index 1][key or index 2][key or index 3]\" to access deeper levels.\n2. Know the structure of the JSON file: You need to know the structure of the JSON file before accessing the value \"c\". You can use a JSON parser library or other tools to help you understand the structure of the file.\n3. Iterate through the structure: If the JSON structure is dynamic and not known beforehand, you can use iterative methods to navigate through objects and arrays and find the value programmatically.\n4. Handle data types: JSON supports various data types (e.g., objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null), so you need to handle these data types appropriately when accessing elements.\n\nFor example, you can use a recursive method or an iterative method (such as for-loops) to navigate through the JSON structure and find the value \"c\". Here's an example of a recursive method:\n\n\n```python\ndef access_value(obj, path):\n    # Split the path into parts\n    parts = path.split('.')\n    # Get the current object from obj\n    current_obj = obj\n    # Iterate through each part in the path\n    for part in parts:\n        # Get the current key from current_obj\n        current_key = part\n        # Check if current_obj is an object or array\n        if isinstance(current_obj, dict) or isinstance(current_obj, list):\n            # If it's an object, get the current key from it\n            if isinstance(current_obj, dict):\n                current_obj = current_obj[current_key]\n            # If it's an array, get the current index from it\n            else:\n                index = int(current_key)  # assuming the keys are integers in an array\n                current_obj = current_obj[index]\n        else:\n            return None  # assuming we only care about objects and arrays here\n    # If we reach this point, we found the value at the end of the path\n    return current_obj\n```\nYou can call this function with your JSON object and path \"c\" as arguments, like this: `access_value(your_json_object, 'obj[\"id\"][\"N\"][\"subs\"][-1][\"id\"]')`\n\nThis method will traverse through your JSON object until it reaches the value \"c\". If it encounters any errors or invalid paths, it will return None. You can modify this method to handle more complex JSON structures and data types."
