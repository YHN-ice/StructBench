Mistyping a key name or using the wrong case will result in an inability to access the desired data.\n\n3. **Arrays vs. Objects**: Knowing whether the data is stored in an array (accessed by index) or an object (accessed by key) is important. Using the wrong type of accessor will lead to errors.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues**: Ensuring that the data type (e.g., string, number, boolean) is understood; misinterpreting the type can lead to incorrect handling of the value.\n\n5. **Dynamic Keys or Indices**: If keys or indices are dynamic or generated at runtime, they may not be predictable, requiring more complex logic to access values.\n\n6. **Large or Minified JSON**: Working with very large or minified JSON files can make it difficult to read and understand the structure without proper formatting or tools.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors in JSON**: Malformed JSON with syntax errors (like missing commas or brackets) will prevent parsing and need to be corrected before accessing values.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: JSON files should be UTF-8 encoded; if not, there might be issues with special characters or internationalization.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges can help you prepare for parsing and correctly navigating a JSON file to access the desired data.
