If there are encoding issues, some keys or values might not be correctly interpreted.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: Invalid JSON syntax could prevent proper parsing of the file altogether. It's essential that the input JSON is well-formed.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to:\n- Carefully inspect the structure of the JSON file.\n- Differentiate between object keys and array indices.\n- Use proper error handling to avoid type errors.\n- Utilize JSON parsing tools or libraries that can handle large file sizes and encoding effortlessly.\n- Ensure that the JSON is valid before attempting to parse it.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll be able to provide the exact path needed to access the value \"j\"."
