A misspelled key will result in an error or return `undefined`.\n\n3. **Array Indices**: If the value is within an array, you must know the correct index to access it. Array indices start at 0, so it's important to count correctly.\n\n4. **Type Mismatch**: When traversing the JSON structure, you might accidentally treat an object as an array or vice versa, which will lead to errors.\n\n5. **Large Files**: Large JSON files can be difficult to navigate manually and may require automated tools to parse effectively.\n\n6. **Data Format**: Values can be stored in different formats (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.), and using the wrong format to access them can cause issues.\n\n7. **Dynamic Keys**: Sometimes, JSON structures use keys that are dynamically generated and not known ahead of time, making it harder to write a static path to a value.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: JSON is a strict format where a small syntax error (like a missing comma or an extra curly brace) can invalidate the entire file.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, accessing the correct value in a JSON structure requires careful attention to the structure and syntax of the JSON file."
