        "To access the value \"jy\" from the JSON input, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the object within the JSON that contains the \"jy\" value.\n\nIn the provided JSON, there are two objects: `{ \"id\":\"eb\", \"M\":\"ry\", \"subs\":[...], ... }` and `{ \"id\":\"eb\", \"M\":\"ry\", \"subs\":[...], ... }`. You need to find the object that contains the `\"subs\"` array, which is the one with `\"id\":\"eb\"`.\n\n2. Navigate through the `\"subs\"` array to find the nested object that contains \"jy\".\n\nThe nested object in this array may have any depth, so you will need to use recursive or iterative methods to traverse through it. Once you find the object with `\"id\":\"eb\"` and `\"subs\":[...]`, you will need to check if it contains a nested object with `\"id\":\"db\"` or `\"id\":\"cb\"` that has the value \"jy\".\n\n3. If you find the desired value, extract it using its key name.\n\nOnce you find the nested object with \"jy\", you can extract its value using its key name. For example, if \"jy\" is stored in a key named `\"D\"` or `\"subs\"`[0].value, you can access it using `obj[\"D\"]` or `obj[\"subs\"][0].value`.\n\nNote: The provided JSON structure is quite complex and may require some time to navigate through it. If you are dealing with large JSON files, it might be helpful to use a JSON parser library like Python's json module or a dedicated JSON parser library to parse and traverse the data."
