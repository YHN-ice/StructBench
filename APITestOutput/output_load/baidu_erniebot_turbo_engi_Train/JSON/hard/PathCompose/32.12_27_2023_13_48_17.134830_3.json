It’s important to understand the type of each element within the JSON structure.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: When writing the access path, it's easy to make syntax errors such as missing quotation marks, brackets, or commas.\n\n7. **Data Volume**: A very large JSON file may be difficult to visually inspect, and thus, finding the correct path to the desired value can be time-consuming.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file includes special characters or is not properly encoded, it can present challenges in parsing and accessing specific data points.\n\nHaving understood these potential obstacles, we can now look at the JSON file to answer your question accurately.
