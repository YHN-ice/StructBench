It could be part of a composite key or in a format that requires parsing (such as a UUID).\n\n5. **Possible Errors in JSON:** The JSON file could contain errors such as missing brackets, commas, or quotation marks that might prevent proper parsing of the file.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues:** The file might use an unexpected character encoding, which could interfere with correctly interpreting text within the JSON data.\n\n7. **Access Permissions:** There could be file access permissions that prevent reading the content of the JSON file.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to ensure that we can access and read the entire JSON file, handle its structure accurately, manage any potential duplications or data type/format issues, and properly parse it while being prepared to deal with any malformations or encoding problems."
