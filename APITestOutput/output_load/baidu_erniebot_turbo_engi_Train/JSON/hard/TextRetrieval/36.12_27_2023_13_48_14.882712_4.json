Non-Uniform Structures: JSON files could have non-uniform structures, meaning some parts of the file could be more deeply nested than others. Identifying the \"most deeply nested\" objects requires a comparison of nesting levels across different branches of the JSON structure.\n\n5. Data Types and Formats: JSON supports various data types, and ensuring proper handling of all these types (e.g., strings with escape sequences, numbers with different formats) is important.\n\n6. Encoding and Special Characters: The JSON file might contain special characters or be encoded in a way that requires careful handling to ensure an accurate parsing.\n\n7.
