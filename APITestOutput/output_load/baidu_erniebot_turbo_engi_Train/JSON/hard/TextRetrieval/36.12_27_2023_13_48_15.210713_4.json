        "As per your question, you want to find the most deeply nested objects in the JSON structure which have no value of type list or dict. Let's analyze this issue step by step.\n\nFirst of all, we need to understand that JSON structure can be complex and there could be multiple ways to represent the same concept in nested structures. Let's consider an example:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"n\",\n  \"name\": \"John\",\n  \"nested\": {\n    \"id\": \"nested_obj\",\n    \"value\": \"This is a nested object\",\n    \"sub_obj\": {\n      \"id\": \"sub_obj_1\",\n      \"value\": \"This is a nested object with sub-object\"\n    },\n    \"sub_list\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"sub_list_obj_1\",\n        \"value\": \"This is a nested object in list\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"sub_list_obj_2\",\n        \"value\": \"This is another nested object in list\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, both \"nested\" object and \"sub_list\" array represent the same concept of a nested object, but they are represented differently. To identify the most deeply nested object, we need to define what we mean by \"deeply nested\". In this case, it could be either the object with the most number of levels of nesting or the object with the highest level of nesting where there is no value of type list or dict.\n\nTo handle this issue, we can use a recursive function that traverses the JSON structure and checks for the conditions you mentioned. Here's an example in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef find_deepest_nested_objects(json_str):\n    # Step 1: Parse JSON string to python dictionary\n    data = json.loads(json_str)\n    # Step 2: Initialize counters for each type (dict, list) and level count for each type of data structure (dict/list)\n    counter = defaultdict(int)\n    depth = defaultdict(int)\n    # Step 3: Iterate through each data structure in the dictionary and update counters and depth counts\n    for key, value in data.items():\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            counter['dict'] += 1\n            depth['dict'] = depth['dict'] + 1 if 'list' not in counter else max(depth['list'], depth['dict'])\n            for subkey, subvalue in value.items():\n                if isinstance(subvalue, dict):\n                    counter['dict'] -= 1 if 'list' in counter else counter['dict'] + 1  # If it's a dict, decrease 'dict' count and increase 'list' count if not already a list. If it's a list, decrease 'list' count.\n        elif isinstance(value, list):\n            counter['list'] += 1 if 'dict' not in counter else max(depth['list'], counter['list'])  # If it's a list, increase 'list' count and decrease 'dict' count. It represents an array where we might have an object without dict or list as a value. We update depth here to take care of that possibility.\n    # Step 4: Return the result - The key 'max_level' contains the max depth of nested objects where there is no value of type list or dict. You can iterate through this key to get all such objects. You can also get the corresponding values using the key 'max_level'.depth. This will give you the depth of each such object.\n    return max(depth, key=max_level)['max_level'] if max(depth, key=max_level) else None  # max_level is a placeholder for your actual key name. You should replace it with something meaningful like 'no_list_dict'.\n```\nPlease note that this code assumes that your JSON string is correctly formatted and represents a valid JSON structure. If your JSON string is invalid or contains circular references, this code will raise an error. You should handle these cases before using this code."
