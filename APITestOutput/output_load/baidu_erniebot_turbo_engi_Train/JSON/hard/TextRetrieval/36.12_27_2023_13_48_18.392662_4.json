The parser must correctly handle these and only exclude objects that contain list or dict.\n\n7. **Output formatting**: If multiple objects qualify as \"most deeply nested,\" they need to be returned in the specified format, which could require additional handling in the code to concatenate and separate with new lines.\n\n8. **Cyclic references**: In some cases, JSON might contain references that create cycles. While this isn't typically allowed in standard JSON, it can occur in extended or non-standard implementations and would need special handling to avoid infinite loops.\n\n9. **Incomplete or malformed JSON**: The input file might be incomplete or malformed (missing brackets, commas, etc.), which could cause errors during parsing.\n\n10. **Encoding issues**: The file might contain characters that are not properly encoded, leading to parsing errors or incorrect interpretations of the content.\n\nOnce I see the JSON file, I can provide a more accurate answer to your initial question."
