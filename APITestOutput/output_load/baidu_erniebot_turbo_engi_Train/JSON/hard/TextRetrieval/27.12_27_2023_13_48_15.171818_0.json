Complex Nesting: JSON files can have multiple levels of nested objects and arrays. If the object with id 'x' is nested deeply, it may be challenging to navigate to the correct location in the hierarchy.\n\n3. Non-unique IDs: If the 'id' attribute is not unique and appears in multiple objects, distinguishing which object is being referred to as 'x' may be problematic.\n\n4. Data Format: JSON files can sometimes contain data that's not well-formed or does not strictly adhere to JSON standards, which could make parsing difficult.\n\n5. Ambiguous Queries: If the request for 'id x' is ambiguous (e.g., if 'x' is a placeholder rather than the actual id value), it might be unclear what exactly is being requested without additional context.\n\n6. Encoding Issues: Files can have encoding issues that may prevent correct parsing of the text, especially if special characters are involved.\n\n7.
