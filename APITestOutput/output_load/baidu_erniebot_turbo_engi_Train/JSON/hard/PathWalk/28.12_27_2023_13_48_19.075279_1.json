        "The first object's id of the \"subs\" array is \"q\".\n\nThe JSON structure you provided contains an array of objects, where each object represents a level in the nested structure. In this case, you're trying to find the id of the first object within the \"subs\" array of an object within the \"subs\" array of an object within the main structure.\n\nBased on your description, you want to access the first object's id within the \"subs\" array of an object that has a specific id (e.g., \"p\"). You've provided that the id of the parent object is \"p\", and that its \"subs\" array contains another array of objects.\n\nTo access the first object's id within this nested structure, you need to follow the path from the root of the JSON structure to the specific object with id \"p\". Once you've found that object, you can access its \"subs\" array and find the first object within it with id \"q\".\n\nIn your specific case, the first object's id within the \"subs\" array of an object with id \"p\" is \"q\".\n\nIf you're using a programming language that supports JSON parsing, you can use a JSON library to parse the JSON file and access the desired information.

Here's an example:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\njson_data = '''...'''  # Your JSON data here\n\n# Parse JSON data\ndata = json.loads(json_data)\n\n# Find parent object with id 'p'\nparent_object = next(parent for parent in data if parent['id'] == 'p')\n\n# Access first object in 'subs' array of parent object\nfirst_object = next(sub for sub in parent_object['subs'] if sub['id'] == 'q')\n\n# Get id of first object\nfirst_object_id = first_object['id']\n```\nIn this example, `json.loads()` is used to parse the JSON data, and `next()` is used to iterate over the parent objects in the data until a parent with id \"p\" is found. Once found, it iterates over the \"subs\" array of the parent object until a sub-object with id \"q\" is found, and then accesses its 'id' attribute."
