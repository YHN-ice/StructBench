Ambiguity in Query: The term \"first object's id\" could be ambiguous if the structure of the objects within \"subs\" is not uniform or if there are multiple identifiers.\n\n5. Array Indexing: Knowing that arrays are zero-indexed in most programming languages, if \"first\" is interpreted incorrectly (e.g., as a one-indexed position), it could lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n6. Data Types: The \"id\" could be a string, a number, or another datatype, and misinterpreting the datatype could lead to an incorrect response.\n\n7.
