Incorrect use of brackets: JSON objects are encapsulated within curly braces `{}`, and arrays are encapsulated within square brackets `[]`. These must be correctly opened and closed.\n\n4. Data types issues: Values must be of an appropriate data type (string, number, object, array, boolean, or null).
