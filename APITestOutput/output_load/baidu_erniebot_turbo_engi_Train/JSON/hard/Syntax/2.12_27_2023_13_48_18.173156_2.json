Here are common issues that can lead to structural errors in a JSON file:\n\n1. **Improper Brackets**: JSON structures are based on nested objects `{}` and arrays `[]`. Every opening bracket (`{` or `[`) must be paired with a corresponding closing bracket (`}` or `]`).\n\n2. **Missing or Extra Commas**: Objects and arrays are composed of elements separated by commas. Missing a comma between elements or having an extra trailing comma can cause a structural error.\n\n3. **Key-Value Pair Issues**: In JSON objects, each key must be a string wrapped in double quotes, followed by a colon `:` and then the value. Missing quotes around keys, missing colons, or using equals `=` instead of a colon can lead to errors.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings (which must be in double quotes), numbers, objects, arrays, booleans (`true` or `false`), and `null`. Using unsupported data types or misrepresenting the data types (like omitting quotes for strings) can cause errors.\n\n5. **Encoding Problems**: JSON text must be properly encoded (usually as UTF-8). If the encoding is incorrect, this might lead to parse errors.\n\n6. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments. If comments are present, this is not valid JSON, although some parsers may still be able to handle it.\n\n7. **Extraneous Data**: Anything outside of the top-level JSON object or array that is not properly encapsulated can result in a structural error.\n\nWithout seeing the actual JSON file, it's impossible to say whether there are any structural errors. Once I have access to the input file, I'll be able to perform the parsing task and identify any potential issues based on the rules mentioned above."
