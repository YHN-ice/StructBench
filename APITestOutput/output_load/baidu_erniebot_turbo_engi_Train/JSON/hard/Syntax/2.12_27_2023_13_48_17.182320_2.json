If a key is unquoted, it will cause an error.\n\n3. Incorrect quotation marks: JSON requires the use of double quotes for strings. Single quotes are not valid and will cause an error.\n\n4. Unescaped characters: Special characters within strings need to be escaped with a backslash. For example, a double quote inside a string should be written as \\\".\n\n5. Data type errors: JSON supports specific data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Errors can occur if the wrong data type is used.\n\n6. Braces and brackets mismatch: JSON uses curly braces for objects and square brackets for arrays. Errors can happen if they are mismatched or incorrectly nested.\n\n7. Trailing commas: Unlike some other languages, JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an object or array.\n\n8. Syntax errors: This includes any issues that violate the JSON syntax rules, such as missing colons between keys and values or using comments (which are not allowed in JSON).\n\nOnce I see the JSON input file, I'll be able to determine if any of these errors is present and answer accordingly."
