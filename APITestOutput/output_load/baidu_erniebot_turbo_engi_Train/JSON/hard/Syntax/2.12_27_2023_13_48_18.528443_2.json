Using an unsupported data type would lead to an error.\n\n2. **Missing or Extra Commas**: JSON requires commas to separate elements in objects and arrays. A missing comma can lead to parsing errors, and an extra comma (especially as the last element in an object or array) can also cause errors.\n\n3. **Unquoted Keys**: In JSON, all keys must be strings and therefore should be enclosed in double quotes. Unquoted keys are a common source of errors.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: JSON does not allow trailing commas at the end of lists or objects, unlike some other languages that may be more lenient with this.\n\n5. **Mismatched Brackets or Braces**: JSON structures must have matching sets of curly braces for objects and square brackets for arrays. Mismatched or unbalanced delimiters will result in an error.\n\n6. **Improper String Formatting**: Strings in JSON must be wrapped in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid for string definition, and special characters within strings need to be escaped properly.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8 without a byte order mark (BOM). Improper encoding can cause unexpected errors during parsing.\n\n8. **Nested Structures**: Complex JSON files with many levels of nested objects and arrays can sometimes obscure structural errors, making them harder to detect.\n\n9. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, so any presence of comments will lead to errors.\n\n10. **Data Precision**: JSON represents numbers in decimal format and might not maintain high precision for very large or very small numbers, which can be an issue for certain applications although this is not strictly a \"structural\" error.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in scrutinizing the JSON file structure more accurately.\n\nPlease provide the JSON file you'd like me to check for structural errors."
