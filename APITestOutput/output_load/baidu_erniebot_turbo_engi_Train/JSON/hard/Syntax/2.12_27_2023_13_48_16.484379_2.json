Missing or extra commas: Each key-value pair in a JSON object must be separated by a comma, except for the last pair. Similarly, elements in arrays must be separated by commas. A missing or extra comma can cause a parsing error.\n\n2. Unquoted keys or strings: In JSON, all keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid in JSON.\n\n3. Trailing commas: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an array or the last key-value pair in an object.\n\n4. Incorrect bracket pairing: JSON objects are enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. All opening brackets must be properly paired with their corresponding closing brackets.\n\n5. Mismatched data types: JSON values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, `true`, `false`, or `null`. A common error is mismatching these types, such as placing a string without quotes or using invalid literals.\n\n6. Nesting errors: JSON allows objects and arrays to be nested within each other. Improper nesting can cause structural issues.\n\n7. Encoding issues: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8 without a byte-order mark (BOM). Some parsers may have issues with other encodings or the presence of a BOM.\n\n8. Syntactical errors: Any deviation from the syntax rules of JSON can cause a structural error, such as using `undefined`, functions, or date objects which are not valid JSON data types.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the given JSON file, it would result in a structural error.
