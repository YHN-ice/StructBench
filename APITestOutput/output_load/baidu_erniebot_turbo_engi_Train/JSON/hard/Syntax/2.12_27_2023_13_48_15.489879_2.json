Unmatched or misplaced curly braces `{}` or square brackets `[]`: These are used to define objects and arrays in JSON, respectively. If they are not properly closed or are mismatched, it will lead to a structural error.\n\n3. Improper quotation marks: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes `\"\"`. Single quotes `''` are not valid, and leaving out quotes altogether will also result in an error.\n\n4. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in arrays and objects, trailing commas are not allowed in JSON and will cause an error.\n\n5. Data types issues: JSON allows for specific data types (string, number, object, array, boolean, null). Mistakingly assigning an invalid data type or incorrectly formatting a value can result in an error.\n\n6. Key duplication: Having two identical keys within the same object could be problematic, as it may lead to undefined behavior or overwriting of values.\n\n7. Encoding problems: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. If there is an encoding mismatch or invalid character encoding, the JSON may not be parsed correctly.\n\nPlease provide the JSON content so I can check for any structural errors."
