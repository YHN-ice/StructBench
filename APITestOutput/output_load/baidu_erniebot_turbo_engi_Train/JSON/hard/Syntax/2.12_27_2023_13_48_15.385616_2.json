Missing or extra commas: Each key-value pair in an object should be separated by a comma, but there shouldn't be a trailing comma after the last pair.\n\n2. Unquoted keys or strings: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Improper use of brackets: Objects should be enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and arrays should be enclosed in square brackets `[]`.\n\n4. Data type errors: JSON supports specific data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Values should be of the correct type.\n\n5. Syntax errors: This includes misplaced or mismatched quotation marks, braces, brackets, etc.\n\n6. Depth/nesting issues: There are limits to how deeply JSON structures can be nested, depending on the parser being used.\n\n7. Encoding issues: JSON should be UTF-8 encoded.\n\nOnce we see the given JSON file, we can check for these potential problems to determine whether there's a structural error."
