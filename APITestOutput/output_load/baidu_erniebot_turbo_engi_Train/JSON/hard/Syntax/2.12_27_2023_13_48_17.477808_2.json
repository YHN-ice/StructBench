Commas separate key-value pairs and array elements, while colons separate keys from their values.\n\n2. **Data Types:** JSON supports specific data types: string, number, object, array, true, false, and null. It's important to ensure that data types are used correctly (e.g., strings are enclosed in double quotes, numbers are not).\n\n3. **Nesting:** JSON objects and arrays can be nested within each other. It's essential to ensure that nested structures are correctly formatted and properly closed with the corresponding closing symbol.\n\n4. **Commas and Colons:** A common mistake is missing or extraneous commas between elements in arrays or between key-value pairs in objects. Similarly, colons must be used to separate keys from values.\n\n5. **Encoding:** The file encoding should be UTF-8 without a byte-order mark (BOM) for maximum compatibility.\n\nIf any of these elements are incorrect or misused, the JSON would have a structural error.
