Unmatched or misplaced brackets and braces: Arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]`, and objects are enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Each opening bracket or brace must have a matching closing one.\n3. Incorrect string encapsulation: Strings must be enclosed in double quotes `\"`. Single quotes `'` are not valid string delimiters in JSON.\n4. Key-value pair issues: In JSON objects, each key must be a string enclosed in double quotes, followed by a colon `:`, and then the value.\n5. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans (`true` or `false`), and `null`. Values should be of the correct type.\n6.
