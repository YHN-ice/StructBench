Some common issues that can occur in JSON files include:\n\n1. Missing or extra commas: Each pair in a JSON object or each element in an array should be separated by a comma, but there should not be a comma after the last pair/element.\n\n2. Incorrect use of quotes: In JSON, all strings should be enclosed in double quotes. Keys in objects must also be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Braces and brackets mismatch: Each opened curly brace `{` must have a corresponding closing brace `}`, and each opened square bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing bracket `]`.\n\n4. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types, such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Values must be of the correct type.\n\n5. Trailing commas: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an array or the last pair in an object.\n\n6. Unescaped characters: Within strings, certain characters like the backslash `\\`, double quote `\"`, and control characters must be escaped with a backslash.\n\n7. Nested structures: Errors can happen in the nesting of arrays and objects, leading to malformed JSON.\n\nIf the given JSON has any of these issues or other syntactical errors, it won't be considered valid JSON.
