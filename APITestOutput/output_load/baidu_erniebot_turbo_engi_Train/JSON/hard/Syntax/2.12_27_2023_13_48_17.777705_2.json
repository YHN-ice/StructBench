A common mistake is using an incorrect data type for a value.\n\n3. **Nested Structures**: JSON can have complex nested structures which might be difficult to navigate if not formatted clearly.\n\n4. **Key Uniqueness**: In JSON objects, keys should be unique within an object. Duplicate keys can cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas**: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in arrays and objects, JSON does not permit this.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: JSON data should be in UTF-8 encoding. If the file has a different encoding, it might not be parsed correctly.\n\n7. **Large Files**: Extremely large JSON files may be difficult to parse due to memory constraints or could take a long time to process.\n\n8. **Comments**: JSON does not support comments, and including them can invalidate the JSON.\n\nTo accurately assess the JSON file for structural errors, I would need to review the actual content of the file.
