However, there should not be a trailing comma after the last key-value pair in an object or the last element in an array.\n\n2. **Incorrect Braces and Brackets:** JSON objects are enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. It's important that opening braces and brackets are properly matched with their closing counterparts.\n\n3. **Improper Quotes:** In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes `\"\"`. Single quotes `''` are not valid.\n\n4. **Invalid Data Types:** JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans (`true` or `false`), and `null`. Non-supported data types or incorrectly formatted values will result in errors.\n\n5. **Key Duplication:** Within a single JSON object, keys must be unique. Duplicate keys can lead to undefined behavior.\n\n6. **Colon Separation:** In key-value pairs, the key and value must be separated by a colon `:`.\n\nConsidering these potential issues, I'll be able to spot structural errors in the given JSON file once it's provided.
