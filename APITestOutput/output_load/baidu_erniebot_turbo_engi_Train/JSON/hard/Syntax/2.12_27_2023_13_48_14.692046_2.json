Here are potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of identifying structural errors:\n\n1. **Missing commas**: In JSON, objects and arrays are separated by commas. If a comma is missing, it can lead to parsing errors.\n\n2. **Extra commas**: On the other hand, having an extra comma at the end of an object or array (also known as trailing commas) is not allowed in JSON and will cause an error.\n\n3. **Mismatched braces and brackets**: Every opening brace `{` must have a corresponding closing brace `}`, and every opening bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing bracket `]`. An imbalance will result in a structural error.\n\n4. **Improper quotes**: JSON requires double quotes for strings and object keys. Single quotes or absence of quotes will result in an error.\n\n5. **Data types**: JSON has specific data types, such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Incorrectly formatted data types, like unquoted strings or improperly formatted numbers, can cause errors.\n\n6. **Nested structures**: Errors can occur if objects or arrays are improperly nested within each other.\n\n7. **Encoding issues**: Non-standard characters or incorrect encoding can lead to parsing errors.\n\n8. **Syntax inconsistencies**: JSON syntax is very specific and does not allow for comments or functions. Any deviation from the standard syntax may result in an error.\n\nThese are common points of failure when parsing JSON files. Now, if you provide me with the JSON file in question, I'll be able to determine if there are any structural errors present."
