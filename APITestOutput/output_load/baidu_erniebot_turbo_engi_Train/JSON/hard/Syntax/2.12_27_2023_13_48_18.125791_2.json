Missing quotes or the use of single quotes can result in errors.\n\n3. **Data Types**: JSON supports data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. A mismatch or improper usage of these types could lead to errors.\n\n4. **Brace Matching**: Every opening brace `{` should have a corresponding closing brace `}` for objects, and similarly, every opening bracket `[` should have a corresponding closing bracket `]` for arrays.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas**: Although some modern interpreters might allow it, trailing commas are considered invalid in JSON and can lead to errors.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text shall be encoded in UTF-8 without BOM (Byte Order Mark). Encoding issues might prevent proper parsing.\n\n7. **Nested structures**: Deeply nested or complex structures can be confusing and might introduce errors if not handled carefully.\n\nThese are common issues that might occur with JSON files.
