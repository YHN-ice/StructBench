JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. The common structural errors in a JSON file can include:\n\n1. Missing or extra commas: In JSON, elements in an array are separated by commas, and so are key-value pairs in an object. A missing comma can lead to a parsing error, as can an extra comma after the last element or key-value pair.\n\n2. Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and string values: In JSON, keys must be strings written within double quotes. Similarly, string values must also be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Improper use of brackets: JSON uses curly braces `{}` to denote objects and square brackets `[]` to denote arrays. An error could arise from mismatched or improperly nested brackets.\n\n4. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Inserting a value of an incorrect type or a JavaScript-specific notation (like `undefined`) will result in an error.\n\n5. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages which allow trailing commas in arrays and objects, trailing commas are not allowed in JSON.\n\n6. Syntax errors: This can include invalid characters or strings, improper escape sequences, or other typos that violate JSON syntax rules.\n\nOnce you provide the JSON file, I will be able to analyze it for any such structural errors."
