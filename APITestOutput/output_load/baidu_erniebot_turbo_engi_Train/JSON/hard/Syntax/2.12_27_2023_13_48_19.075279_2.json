Missing or extra commas can cause parsing errors.\n\n3. **Improper Quotation**: JSON requires double quotes for strings and object keys.

Assigning incorrect data types (like unquoted strings) is a common error.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas**: While some parsers allow trailing commas, they are technically not allowed in JSON and can cause errors in strict parsers.\n\n6. **Nested Structure Complexity**: Deeply nested objects or arrays can sometimes make it difficult to spot errors at a glance.\n\n7. **Encoding Problems**: If the JSON is not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), some characters may not be correctly interpreted.\n\n8. **Lack of Context**: Without knowing the expected schema or structure of the JSON, it can be harder to identify logical errors as opposed to syntactical ones.\n\nPlease provide the JSON file content so I can check for any structural errors."
