Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of identifying structural errors in a JSON file:\n\n1. **Missing or Extra Commas**: JSON objects should separate key-value pairs with commas. An extra comma or a missing comma can lead to an error.\n\n2. **Invalid Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types such as number, string, boolean, array, object, and null. If a value does not conform to these types, it could be an error.\n\n3. **Unquoted Strings**: In JSON, keys and string values should be enclosed in double quotes. Unquoted strings are a common error.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: While some languages allow trailing commas in lists and objects, JSON does not permit this. A trailing comma after the last element in an array or the last pair in an object is an error.\n\n5. **Improper Brackets**: JSON requires curly braces for objects and square brackets for arrays. Mismatched or improperly nested brackets can cause structural errors.\n\n6. **Incorrect Escaping**: Special characters in strings need to be escaped with a backslash. Improper escaping can result in errors.\n\n7. **Key Duplication**: JSON objects should not have duplicate keys. If the same key is repeated with different values, it could be considered an error.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: Any deviation from the correct JSON syntax, such as missing colons between keys and values or using single quotes instead of double quotes, can result in errors.\n\nIf the JSON file contains any of these issues, it would be considered to have structural errors.
