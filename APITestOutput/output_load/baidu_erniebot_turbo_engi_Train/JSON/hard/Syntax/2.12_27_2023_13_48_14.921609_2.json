Common syntax errors include missing commas, colons, or quotes, using single quotes instead of double quotes, extra trailing commas, or misplaced brackets and braces.\n\n2. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. An error might occur if a value is not of the expected type (e.g., a string not enclosed in quotes).\n\n3. **Nesting and Hierarchy**: JSON objects and arrays can be nested within each other. Errors in nesting can lead to an incorrect hierarchy or structure.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: JSON should be encoded in UTF-8. Any deviation might cause issues in parsing.\n\n5. **Large Files**: Extremely large JSON files could cause performance issues during parsing, potentially leading to timeouts or crashes.\n\n6. **Comments**: JSON does not officially support comments. If comments are included, it can lead to errors.\n\n7. **Duplicate Keys**: While not always considered a structural error, JSON objects with duplicate keys can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n8. **Formatting**: Incorrect formatting can make it difficult to parse the data correctly, even if the syntax is technically correct.\n\n9. **Data Integrity**: Errors may not be structural but rather with the integrity or consistency of the data (e.g., mismatched data types across similar objects).\n\n10. **Tool-specific Parsing Rules**: Different tools may have unique parsing behaviors or non-standard extensions that could cause errors when switching between tools.\n\nIt's important to systematically check for these potential issues to ensure accurate identification of any structural errors in a JSON file."
