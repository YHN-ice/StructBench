A missing comma can cause a parsing error.\n\n2. **Trailing Commas**: Although some parsers allow it, according to the JSON specification, trailing commas are not allowed. They can cause errors in strict parsers.\n\n3. **Mismatched Braces or Brackets**: Every opening brace `{` or bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing brace `}` or bracket `]`. Mismatched or unbalanced delimiters can lead to errors.\n\n4. **Improper Quotes**: JSON requires double quotes for strings and keys. Using single quotes or no quotes at all can cause errors.\n\n5. **Data Types**: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). If a value is not properly formatted as one of these types (e.g., unquoted strings for non-boolean/null values), there will be an error.\n\n6. **Extra Characters or Syntax**: Any characters or syntax that do not conform to the JSON format specification can cause errors. This includes comments, which are not allowed in standard JSON.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file has encoding issues like non-UTF-8 characters without proper escaping, it can lead to errors during parsing.\n\n8. **Nested Objects/Arrays**: Deeply nested objects or arrays can sometimes be confusing and may lead to structural errors if not handled carefully.\n\nPlease provide the JSON content to be checked for structural errors, and I will analyze it accordingly."
