Unquoted keys: Keys in JSON must always be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Improper quotes: JSON requires double quotes for strings. Single quotes are not valid.\n\n4. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in arrays and objects, JSON does not permit this.\n\n5. Missing or extra curly braces or brackets: Objects are enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and arrays are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Missing or extra braces or brackets can lead to errors.\n\n6. Incorrect data types: For instance, strings should be in double quotes, numbers should not have quotes, and booleans are represented by the keywords `true` and `false` without quotes.\n\n7. Nesting errors: Objects and arrays can be nested within each other, but they must be properly closed and matched.\n\n8. Syntax errors: For example, using a colon instead of a comma to separate elements, or using a semi-colon where a comma is expected.\n\nTo check for these potential errors, I would need to see the JSON file's content.
