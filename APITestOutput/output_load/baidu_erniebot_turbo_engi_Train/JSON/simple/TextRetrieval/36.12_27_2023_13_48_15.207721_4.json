Identifying the deepest level where no objects or arrays exist could be challenging.\n\n2. **Heterogeneous Data Types:** Within a nested structure, there can be a mix of data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, and other objects. Ensuring that only the deepest level without any arrays or objects is identified while ignoring other data types could be complex.\n\n3. **Large JSON Files:** If the JSON file is very large with many nested structures, it might be difficult to visually inspect and determine the depth of nesting.\n\n4. **Similar Keys at Different Depths:** JSON objects can have keys with the same name at different levels of nesting. Care must be taken to ensure that the correct level is identified.\n\n5. **Recursive Structures:** In some JSON files, there could be recursive structures where an object might indirectly contain itself through a series of nested objects. This can be particularly tricky to handle programmatically.\n\n6. **Identifying Unique Paths:** There might be more than one most deeply nested object, and each may have a unique path in the JSON structure. It will be necessary to identify all unique deepest paths.\n\n7. **Formatting and Syntax:** Properly parsing the JSON file requires attention to correct formatting and syntax, such as matching braces and quotation marks.\n\n8. **Performance Concerns:** For very large and deeply nested JSON files, performance could become an issue when parsing and processing the file to find the most deeply nested objects.\n\nWithout the ability to parse the JSON file, these cannot be addressed; however, they would need to be taken into consideration in a real scenario where a parser would be implemented."

You can try to use a recursive JSON parser library, such as Python's `json` library, which has a recursive decoder that can handle deeply nested JSON structures.\n2. **Inspect the structure visually:** You can visually inspect the JSON structure to find the deepest level where no objects or arrays exist. This can help you avoid complicated issues such as complex data types or similar keys at different depths.\n3. **Test and verify:** You can try to identify different scenarios in your test cases and verify the results to ensure that the parser is working correctly.\n4. **Performance optimization:** If you encounter performance issues when parsing large JSON files, you can try to use more efficient algorithms or data structures to improve the performance.\n\nIn summary, identifying the most deeply nested object that has no value of type list or dict requires careful consideration of various difficulties and obstacles.
