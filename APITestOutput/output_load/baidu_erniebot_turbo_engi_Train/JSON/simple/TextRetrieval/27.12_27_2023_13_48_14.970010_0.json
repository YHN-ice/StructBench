If the JSON is nested or contains arrays, it might be tricky to locate the correct object.\n\n2. **Finding the Key:** The key 'id' must be searched throughout the JSON file. If there are multiple objects with an 'id' key, we must ensure we find the correct one corresponding to 'x'.\n\n3. **Handling Data Types:** The value of 'id' could be a string, number, or another type. We need to correctly interpret 'x' to match the data type in the JSON.\n\n4. **Excerpt Formatting:** When providing an excerpt from the JSON file, it must be formatted correctly, maintaining the integrity of the JSON structure (proper nesting, commas, brackets, etc.).\n\n5. **Large Files and Performance:** If the JSON file is very large, it may pose performance issues when searching for the object with id 'x'.\n\n6. **Encoding and Special Characters:** The file may contain special characters or encoding that needs to be handled properly to avoid misinterpretation of the data.\n\n7. **Invalid JSON:** The input might not be a valid JSON, which would require error handling or correction before parsing.\n\nTo proceed, I will need to see the actual JSON content to provide an accurate answer."
