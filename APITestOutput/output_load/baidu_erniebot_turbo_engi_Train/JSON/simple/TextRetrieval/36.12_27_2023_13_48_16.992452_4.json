Some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise include:\n\n1. Handling of Different Data Types: JSON files can contain data types like objects (dictionaries in Python), arrays (lists in Python), strings, numbers, booleans, and nulls. Identifying and handling these correctly is essential.\n\n2. Recursion or Iterative Traversal: To find the most deeply nested objects, you may need to use a recursive function or an iterative approach to traverse the JSON structure. Deciding on which approach to use and implementing it correctly can be challenging.\n\n3. Keeping Track of Depth: You need to keep track of the current depth while traversing the JSON structure to identify the most deeply nested objects.\n\n4. Multiple Deepest Objects: There could be more than one object at the same maximum depth. The solution should account for finding all such objects.\n\n5. Variably Nested Structures: JSON files can have irregular nesting, which means not all branches will have the same depth, and some might contain mixed types.\n\n6. Circular References: Although rare and typically considered invalid in JSON, if there are circular references, it could cause an infinite loop in a naive implementation.\n\n7. Large Files: If the JSON file is very large, it might not be feasible to load the entire file into memory, requiring a streaming approach to parsing.\n\nIt's important to create a robust algorithm that can handle these challenges to successfully identify the deepest nested objects without values of type list or dict.
