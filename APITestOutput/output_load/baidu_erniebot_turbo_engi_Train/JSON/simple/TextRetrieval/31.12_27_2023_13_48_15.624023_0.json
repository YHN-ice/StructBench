The id property may not be consistently placed across different objects, requiring a dynamic approach to locate it.\n\n3. **Large file size:** If the JSON file is large, it might be difficult to parse it efficiently without running into performance issues.\n\n4. **Similar or duplicate ids:** There might be multiple objects with the same id, or ids that are similar, making it tricky to ensure the correct object is retrieved.\n\n5. **Encoding and escaping issues:** Special characters in the JSON content may need to be properly handled to avoid parsing errors or misinterpretation of data.\n\n6. **Data types and formats:** Ensuring that the extracted data is correctly interpreted in terms of data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans) is important for accurate representation.\n\nOnce I have access to the JSON file, I will be able to identify and address the specific difficulties related to its content and structure."
