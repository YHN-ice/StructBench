Recursive Structures: JSON data can have recursive structures which can be quite complex to navigate. A parser should be able to handle recursion without getting into infinite loops or stack overflow errors.\n\n2. Large File Size: If the JSON file is very large, it could consume a significant amount of memory or lead to slow processing times. Efficient memory management and streaming techniques might be needed.\n\n3. Nested Levels: There could be many levels of nesting, and keeping track of the depth of each object might require a sophisticated approach.\n\n4. Identifying Terminal Objects: Determining whether an object is the most deeply nested requires a clear definition of what constitutes an object with no further nested list or dict values.\n\n5. Multiple Deeply Nested Objects: There could be multiple objects that are equally deeply nested, which means the parser should be able to identify and return all such instances.\n\n6. Data Types: JSON supports various data types. While parsing, the program must correctly handle and distinguish between strings, numbers, objects (dicts), arrays (lists), booleans, and nulls.\n\n7. Syntax Errors: The JSON file may contain syntax errors which could lead to parsing failures. The parser should ideally report such errors or handle them gracefully.\n\n8. Encoding: The JSON file could be encoded in different character sets, and proper decoding will be necessary to handle any special characters or non-ASCII text.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser needs to be well-designed with error handling, capable of recursive descent, and efficient in terms of memory and processing.
