This would require a more thorough search to find the correct key.\n\n4. **Large File Size**: If the file is very large, it could be computationally intensive to parse it entirely, and it might take significant time to find the object with the id \"ab\".\n\n5. **Data Types and Case Sensitivity**: The value of the id might not be a string; it could be a number or some other data type. Also, JSON is case-sensitive, so \"ab\" is different from \"AB\" or \"Ab\".\n\n6. **Multiple Occurrences of the ID**: The id \"ab\" could appear in multiple places within the JSON file, not just as an object identifier but also as a value or part of another string.\n\n7. **File Readability and Access**: If the JSON file is not properly formatted or if there are issues accessing the file, this could hinder the parsing process.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, I would need to carefully read and navigate through the JSON structure, using precise search criteria to match the exact key and value pair that identifies the object with id \"ab\".
