If the structure is complex, it could be difficult to navigate to the correct location in the hierarchy.\n\n3. **Non-Unique IDs**: If the id field is not guaranteed to be unique and there are multiple objects with the id \"ab\", additional context may be required to determine which one is being referred to.\n\n4. **Data Types and Formats**: JSON supports various data types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null). Ensuring the correct parsing and interpretation of these types is essential.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file contains special characters or has encoding issues, it might cause errors during parsing.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: Any syntax errors in the JSON file (like missing commas or brackets) would make it invalid and could prevent parsing altogether.\n\n7. **Performance Concerns**: Depending on the parser implementation and system resources, performance could be an issue when dealing with very large files or complex operations.\n\n8. **Security Risks**: If the JSON file comes from an untrusted source, there's a risk of security vulnerabilities such as JSON injection.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, a robust JSON parsing strategy should be employed that can handle large files, navigate complex structures efficiently, ensure uniqueness and correct data interpretation, handle any encoding or syntax errors gracefully, and do so with good performance and security practices."
