Additionally, large files may cause performance issues or exceed memory limits.\n\n3. **Non-Standard Formats**: JSON files can contain custom formats that are not immediately recognizable or follow a specific schema which might not be known beforehand, making it difficult to understand the context or the significance of the data without additional information.\n\n4. **Data Integrity Issues**: The JSON file might have missing data, typos, or incorrect values which can lead to errors or incorrect interpretations when trying to read the object with id 'l'.\n\n5. **Ambiguity**: In cases where multiple objects have the same id or the id is not unique, it could lead to ambiguity and confusion as to which object is being requested.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file includes special characters or is encoded in a format that is not UTF-8, there might be difficulties in correctly parsing and displaying the content.\n\n7. **Id Representation**: The id 'l' could potentially be confused with the number '1' or an uppercase 'I', depending on the font or context, leading to potential misidentification of the required object.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: JSON files must adhere to specific syntax rules.
