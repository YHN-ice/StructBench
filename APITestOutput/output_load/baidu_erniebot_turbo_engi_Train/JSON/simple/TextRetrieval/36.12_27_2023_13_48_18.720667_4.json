Load the JSON file into a data structure (e.g., a dictionary) using a JSON parser library (e.g., json in Python).\n2. Initialize a variable `max_depth` to a small positive integer value (e.g., 1) to represent the current maximum depth of objects encountered.\n3. Iterate over the keys in the loaded data structure to traverse the JSON structure.\n4. For each key, recursively traverse its value (if it's a dictionary or list) until it encounters an object without list or dict types as values.\n5. Increment the `max_depth` variable by 1 for each recursive traversal, and store the current `max_depth` value in a new variable `deepest_depth`.\n6. If `deepest_depth` is greater than the current `max_depth`, update `max_depth` to `deepest_depth`.\n7. Continue iterating over the keys in the data structure until all of them have been processed.\n8. At the end of the iteration, the `max_depth` variable will contain the maximum depth of objects encountered, which corresponds to the most deeply nested objects without list or dict types as values.\n\nWith this algorithm, you can identify the most deeply nested objects in a JSON file efficiently and accurately. However, it should be noted that this algorithm assumes that the JSON file follows a consistent structure and that there are no missing or invalid values in the data structure. If these assumptions are not met, it may be necessary to adjust the algorithm accordingly."
