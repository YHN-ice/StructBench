For example, if there is more than one object with an id that starts with \"i\" but no exact ID is specified, this would require additional clarification.\n\n6. **Encoding/Decoding Errors**: JSON files should be in UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding. If the file has a different encoding or contains special characters not properly encoded, this could lead to errors in parsing.\n\n7. **File Accessibility**: There may be issues accessing the file due to permissions or being located in a non-accessible location.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors in JSON**: Errors such as missing commas, quotation marks, or brackets could prevent proper parsing of the JSON file.\n\nTo proceed, please present the JSON file or the specific content you would like to query, and I can help parse the relevant information."
