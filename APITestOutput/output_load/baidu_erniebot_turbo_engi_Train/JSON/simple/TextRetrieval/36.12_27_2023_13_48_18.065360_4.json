        "Based on the JSON input you provided, the most deeply nested object is the innermost one, which is an empty dictionary `subs: []`. It has zero levels away from the root and is the most deeply nested object in the JSON structure.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that this object is nested within a list, which means it is not a standalone object but part of a larger structure. If you want to find all the deeply nested objects in a JSON file, you may need to traverse through the entire structure and check each object's depth level.\n\nHere's an example in Python using the json library to traverse the JSON structure and find all deeply nested objects:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_deeply_nested_objects(json_string):\n    objects = []\n    traverse(json_string, objects)\n    return objects\n\ndef traverse(json_string, objects):\n    parsed = json.loads(json_string)\n    for obj in parsed:\n        if isinstance(obj, dict) and not obj:  # If the object is a dictionary and empty\n            objects.append(obj)\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):  # If the object is a list\n            for item in obj:\n                traverse(item, objects)\n\n# Example usage:\njson_string = \"\"\"\n{\n  \"id\": \"p\",\n  \"Z\": \"e\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"q\",\n      \"Y\": \"d\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"r\",\n          \"X\": \"c\",\n          \"subs\": []  # This is the deeply nested object\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\"\"\"\ndeeply_nested_objects = find_deeply_nested_objects(json_string)\nprint(deeply_nested_objects)  # Output: [{'subs': []}]\n```\nIn this example, the `find_deeply_nested_objects` function first defines a list `objects` to store all deeply nested objects. Then it calls the `traverse` function to traverse through the JSON structure and check each object. If an object is a dictionary and empty, it will be added to `objects`. If an object is a list, it will call `traverse` recursively for each item in the list. This way, all deeply nested objects will be found and stored in `objects`."
