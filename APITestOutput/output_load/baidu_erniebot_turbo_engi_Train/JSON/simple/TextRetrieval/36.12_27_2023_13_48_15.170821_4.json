        "The JSON file you provided contains a deeply nested object with no list or dictionary values. Here's an example of how you can extract the deeply nested object from the JSON file:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Read the JSON file\nwith open('your_file.json', 'r') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Find the deepest nested object\ndeepest_object = None\nfor key, value in data.items():\n    if isinstance(value, dict) and not isinstance(value, list):\n        if deepest_object is None or len(data[key].items()) > len(deepest_object.items()):\n            deepest_object = data[key]\n\n# Output the deeply nested object\nif deepest_object is not None:\n    print(\"Deepest Nested Object:\")\n    print(json.dumps(deepest_object, indent=4))\n```\nLet's break down what this code does:\n\n1. It reads the JSON file using the `json.load()` function. This function returns a dictionary object, which represents the JSON data.\n2. It then iterates over the dictionary's items using a `for` loop. Each item represents a key-value pair in the JSON file.\n3. It checks if the value is a dictionary (`isinstance(value, dict)`). If it is a dictionary, it further checks if it's not a list (`not isinstance(value, list)`). This ensures that we only consider non-list, non-dictionary values.\n4. It keeps track of the deepest nested object by comparing the number of items in each dictionary. The one with more items is considered the deepest.\n5. If it finds a deeply nested object, it prints it using the `json.dumps()` function with indent set to 4 for pretty printing and alignment.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes your JSON file is valid and has the structure you provided. If your JSON file has any syntax errors or malformed structures, this code may not work as expected. It's always a good practice to validate your JSON files before parsing them to ensure they are valid and consistent."
