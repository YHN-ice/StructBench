        "Certainly, it's a challenging task to parse deeply nested JSON objects without list or dict values. The most common ways to deal with this type of situation are using recursive methods or a tree-based approach.\n\nThe input JSON you provided contains an object with three levels of nesting. Each level has an array (subs) of objects that contain the same structure.\n\nOne approach could be to iterate over each object in the \"subs\" array and check if it's an empty dictionary or list. If it's not, you can move to the next level. If it is, you can stop traversing the current level and move to the next one.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that demonstrates this approach:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef extract_deeply_nested_objects(json_string):\n    objects = json.loads(json_string)\n    result = []\n    for obj in objects[\"subs\"]:\n        if not isinstance(obj, (dict, list)):\n            result.append(obj)\n        elif isinstance(obj, dict):\n            result += extract_deeply_nested_objects(obj)\n    return result\n\njson_file = 'your_json_file.json'\nwith open(json_file, 'r') as f:\n    json_string = f.read()\n    extracted_objects = extract_deeply_nested_objects(json_string)\n    for obj in extracted_objects:\n        print(json.dumps(obj, indent=4))\n        print(\"\\n\")\n```\nThis code assumes that the JSON file is formatted correctly and the \"subs\" array contains only valid JSON objects. It also assumes that there are no circular references in the JSON data. If these assumptions are not met, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nThis approach will extract all deeply nested objects from the JSON file and print them in the requested format (indented and separated by newline characters).
