This often means recursively checking each object until the terminal values are found.\n\n3. **Maintaining Context**: When parsing deeply nested JSON, it's important to keep track of the context to correctly identify where each object is located within the hierarchy.\n\n4. **Multiple Deepest Points**: There could be multiple objects that are equally deeply nested. Each of these needs to be identified and returned.\n\n5. **Formatting Output**: Presenting the nested objects in an excerpt as they appear in the JSON file while maintaining readability can be challenging, especially if the original formatting of the JSON has to be preserved.\n\n6. **Potential Size of JSON**: Large JSON files could pose performance issues, depending on the parsing algorithm's efficiency and the system's available resources.\n\n7. **Handling Ambiguity**: Some JSON structures may present ambiguity, such as an empty list or dict being technically very deeply nested but not containing any data.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, systematic recursion and careful tracking of the depth level, along with maintaining a list of terminal objects at maximum depth, would be needed.
