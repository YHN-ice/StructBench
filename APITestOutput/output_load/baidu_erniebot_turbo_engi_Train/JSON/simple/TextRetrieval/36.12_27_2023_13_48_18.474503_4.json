Large files require more memory and processing power to parse and analyze.\n\n3. **Ambiguous Definition of \"Deepest\"**: Depending on how \"deeply nested\" is defined (e.g., by the number of nesting levels or by some other criteria), different approaches may be needed to identify the most deeply nested objects.\n\n4. **Mixed Data Types**: JSON objects can contain a mix of data types. Objects that are considered \"deeply nested\" need to be determined based on whether lists and dictionaries are considered part of the nesting or if they should be excluded.\n\n5. **Identical Depth Objects**: There may be multiple objects at the same depth level. Determining which to consider as \"most deeply nested\" could require additional criteria or returning multiple results.\n\n6. **Circular References**: Although not common in JSON due to its nature, if the JSON structure contains circular references (which is technically not supported by JSON but could appear in structures meant to be converted to objects in languages that support such references), it would be difficult to parse without special handling.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: If the JSON file has syntactical errors, it would be a challenge to parse without first correcting these errors.\n\nOnce you provide the JSON file, I can proceed with identifying the most deeply nested objects according to your definition of \"deeply nested.\""
