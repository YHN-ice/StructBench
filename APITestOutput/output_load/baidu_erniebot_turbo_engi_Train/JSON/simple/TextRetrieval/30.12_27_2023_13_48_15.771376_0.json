Large or complex JSON structure: If the JSON file is very large or has a deeply nested structure, finding the specific object might require more advanced parsing techniques and could affect performance.\n\n3. Multiple objects with the same id: If there are multiple objects with the id \"d\" within the JSON file, identifying which one to provide as the excerpt might be ambiguous without additional context or selection criteria.\n\n4. Missing or incomplete data: If the object with id \"d\" is missing or only partially included in the JSON file, this could lead to an incomplete response.\n\n5.
