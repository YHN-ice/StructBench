Handling Large JSON Files: If the JSON file is particularly large, it could be challenging to process it efficiently without running into memory or performance issues.\n\n2. Deeply Nested Structures: JSON files can have objects nested within other objects, which might require recursive parsing or stack-based approaches to keep track of the depth and navigate the structure properly.\n\n3. Identifying Terminal Objects: Determining whether an object is the most deeply nested requires checking if its values are all primitive types (e.g., string, number, boolean) and do not contain any lists or dictionaries themselves.\n\n4. Multiple Instances: There could be several objects that are most deeply nested, and identifying all instances would require keeping track of all such objects found during the parsing process.\n\n5. Ambiguous Definitions: What constitutes \"most deeply nested\" might need clarification. For example, if two objects are at the same depth but one is within a list and the other is within an object, it might be ambiguous which one is considered more deeply nested without specific criteria.\n\n6. Output Formatting: Presenting the output in a clear and coherent format that conveys the correct context within the JSON structure could be challenging, especially when required to separate them with specific delimiters like \"\\n\\n\".\n\nTo deal with these challenges, we would need to employ an efficient JSON parsing library or method, use a depth-first search strategy, and carefully handle the formatting of the output.
