Determining the most deeply nested objects requires a careful traversal of the entire structure.\n   \n2. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be challenging to process it efficiently without running into performance issues.\n\n3. **Mixed Types**: Objects can contain mixed types (strings, numbers, arrays, other objects), so I need to differentiate between objects and non-object types like arrays to find the most deeply nested \"objects\" as per your definition.\n\n4. **Multiple Deeply Nested Objects**: There may be several objects at the same maximum depth. Identifying all of them could be tricky if they are not at the same place in the hierarchy.\n\n5. **Identifying \"No list or dict\" Values**: As per your request, I should identify objects where no value is of type list or dict. This means even if an object is deeply nested, if one of its values is a list or another object, it wouldn't qualify.\n\nGiven these challenges, I would typically approach this task by writing a recursive function that keeps track of the depth as it traverses the JSON structure.
