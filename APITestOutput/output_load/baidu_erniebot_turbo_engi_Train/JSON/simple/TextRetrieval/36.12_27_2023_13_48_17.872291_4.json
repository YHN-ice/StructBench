        "The JSON you provided is already quite deeply nested, and it does not contain any list or dictionary values. The structure is quite complex, but it should be relatively easy to parse using a recursive approach.\n\nHere's an example of how you might parse this JSON using a recursive function in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef parse_json(json_str):\n    # Convert the JSON string to a Python dictionary\n    data = json.loads(json_str)\n\n    # Recursively traverse the structure\n    for key, value in data.items():\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            # If the value is a dictionary, parse it recursively\n            parse_json(value)\n        elif isinstance(value, list):\n            # If the value is a list, we can't parse it recursively, but we can still traverse it\n            for item in value:\n                if isinstance(item, dict):\n                    parse_json(item)\n        else:\n            # For all other values, just output them directly\n            print(f\"Key: {key}, Value: {value}\")\n\n# Test the function with your JSON string\nparse_json(json_str)\n```\nThis code will parse the JSON string and output each key-value pair as it encounters them. It will also handle deeply nested structures by recursively traversing them.\n\nIf you have a large JSON file, you might want to consider using a streaming parser like `json.scanner` from the `json` module, which can handle large files efficiently by only loading a small amount of data into memory at a time.
