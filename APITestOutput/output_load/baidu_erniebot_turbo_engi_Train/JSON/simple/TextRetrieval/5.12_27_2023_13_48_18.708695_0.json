Nested objects and arrays: If the object with id 'w' is nested within other objects or arrays, additional steps may be required to traverse the JSON structure and locate the correct item.\n\n5. Encoding and character sets: If the JSON file uses a character set or encoding that is not correctly handled, it may cause issues with rendering the content accurately.\n\n6.
