        "根据你的描述，你正在寻找JSON中最深嵌套的对象，即没有列表或字典类型的对象。这是一个复杂的问题，因为JSON结构可以非常复杂，并且可能包含嵌套的列表和字典。\n\n首先，我们需要明确\"最深嵌套的对象\"的定义。这个定义可能根据上下文而变化，例如它可能意味着对象中没有其他对象或列表，无论其深度如何；或者它可能意味着在JSON结构中深度最大的对象。\n\n考虑到这些可能的情况，我建议使用递归方法来遍历JSON结构并找到最深嵌套的对象。下面是一个简单的Python代码示例，它使用递归遍历JSON对象并找到最深嵌套的对象：\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef find_deepest_object(json_string):\n    # 将JSON字符串解析为Python对象\n    obj = json.loads(json_string)\n\n    # 初始化最深嵌套对象的深度为0\n    deepest_depth = 0\n    deepest_object = None\n\n    # 遍历对象的所有属性\n    for key, value in obj.items():\n        # 如果当前对象的深度大于最深嵌套对象的深度，则更新最深嵌套对象的深度和对象\n        if isinstance(value, dict) and len(value) > deepest_depth:\n            deepest_depth = len(value)\n            deepest_object = obj[key]\n\n        # 对子对象进行递归搜索\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            for sub_key, sub_value in value.items():\n                if isinstance(sub_value, dict):\n                    find_deepest_object(f'{json_string}.{key}.{sub_key}')\n\n    return deepest_object, deepest_depth\n```\n这个函数将遍历JSON对象的所有属性，并使用递归搜索子对象。如果找到一个更深嵌套的对象，它将更新最深嵌套对象的深度和对象。最后，它将返回最深嵌套的对象和其深度。\n\n注意：这个函数假设JSON字符串是有效的，并且可以正确地解析为Python对象。此外，这个函数只返回第一个找到的最深嵌套的对象。如果你的JSON结构中有多个这样的对象，你可能需要稍微修改这个函数以正确地处理这种情况。\n\n为了运行此代码，你需要将它保存为`.py`文件（例如`deepest_object.py`），然后在命令行中运行`python deepest_object.py <your_json_file>`，其中`<your_json_file>`是你的JSON文件的路径。"
