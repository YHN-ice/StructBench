        "Based on your description, it seems like the JSON structure you provided has a nested depth of about 3. It's quite a complex JSON structure with multiple levels of nesting, so it may take some time and resources to parse through the entire file.\n\nThe first challenge you mentioned is the complex nesting of JSON files. To handle this, you can use a recursive approach to parse the JSON file. This approach involves recursively traversing through the JSON structure and identifying the deeply nested objects that do not contain list or dictionary values.\n\nAnother challenge you mentioned is identifying the objects that do not contain list or dictionary values. To achieve this, you can use a custom JSON schema to validate the JSON content and identify the deeply nested objects that meet your criteria.\n\nIf the JSON file is very large, you may need to consider using a streaming approach to parse the file incrementally instead of parsing it all at once. This approach can significantly improve performance and reduce memory usage.\n\nWhen dealing with ambiguous definitions of \"most deeply nested\", you can define specific criteria based on the structure of the JSON file and apply them to identify the deeply nested objects. For example, you can define a depth threshold or a specific number of levels of nesting as criteria to determine which object is considered \"most deeply nested\".\n\nRegarding formatting and encoding issues, it's important to ensure that the JSON file follows a valid format and encoding.
