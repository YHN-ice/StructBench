Understanding the structure and hierarchy is important to navigate to the needed information.\n\n3. **Data Types and Format**: Ensuring the correct interpretation of data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans) and formats (e.g., dates, custom formats) is crucial for accurate data retrieval.\n\n4. **Encoding**: The file needs to be correctly encoded (usually UTF-8). If the file has encoding issues, it might not be parsed correctly, leading to errors or misinterpreted data.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: JSON files must adhere to a strict syntax. Any missing or extra commas, quotation marks, or curly braces can cause parsing errors.\n\n6. **Key Names**: JSON keys are case-sensitive and must be referenced precisely as they appear in the file. Typos or incorrect key names can result in the inability to retrieve the desired data.\n\n7. **Misinterpretation of Data**: Without context or proper documentation, it can be easy to misinterpret the purpose or meaning of certain elements within the JSON file.\n\n8. **Access Rights**: Depending on the environment, there may be restrictions on accessing or reading the file due to permissions issues.\n\nOnce I receive the JSON file or content from you, I will be able to address any of these issues that arise and extract the object with the id \"y\".
