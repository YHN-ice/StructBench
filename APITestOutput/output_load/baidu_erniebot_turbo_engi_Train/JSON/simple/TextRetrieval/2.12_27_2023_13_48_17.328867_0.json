This can be mitigated by using a streaming parser or by using a more efficient JSON library.\n* **Complex structure**: Depending on how the JSON is structured (nested objects, arrays, etc.), it might be difficult to locate the object.

This can be overcome by using a library that supports parsing non-standard JSON files.\n* **Multiple objects with the same id**: If there are multiple objects with the id 'p' within the file, it depends on what you want to do with this ambiguity. You might need to define how to handle multiple occurrences or resolve it at a higher level of processing.\n* **Data types and encoding**: Ensure that you handle data types correctly and handle any special character encoding. You can use appropriate data type conversion methods or encoding/decoding libraries to handle this.\n* **Performance considerations**: Efficiently parsing large files is always important, especially if this is part of a larger system with many concurrent tasks. You can use caching, memory management, or other optimization techniques to improve performance.\n* **Error handling**: It is always important to handle errors during parsing, especially if the JSON file contains errors or is malformed. You can use error handling mechanisms such as try/except blocks or custom error classes to handle these situations.\n* **Access to the file**: I have assumed you have access to the JSON file because you provided it in your question.
