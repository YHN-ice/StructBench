If the objects are not consistently formatted or if the identifier is expected to be in a specific format (e.g., a string vs an integer), this might pose a problem.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors in JSON**: Any syntax errors in the JSON file (like missing commas or brackets) could prevent successful parsing of the file.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: If the file uses a non-standard encoding, it could cause parsing errors or incorrect interpretation of the content.\n\n7. **File Accessibility**: The file needs to be accessible to the parser.
