Then, we follow the path through the nested objects and arrays to access the value \"r\". We start by accessing the \"subs\" key in the top-level dictionary, which gives us an array. We then access the first item in the array (index 0), which is another dictionary. From there, we access the \"subs\" key again, which gives us another array. Finally, we access the third item in that array (index 2), which is where we find the value \"r\".\n\nMake sure to handle potential errors by checking that the path exists and that the data is in an expected format.
