A missing comma, extra brace, or misplaced quotation mark can cause parsing errors, making it impossible to access the data correctly until the error is fixed.\n\n5. **Type Errors**: JSON objects and arrays are accessed differently (with keys for objects and indices for arrays), so it's important to know the type of each element you're working with to use the correct access method.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to manually find the correct path to the value, and it can be easy to lose track of where you are in the file.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file has encoding issues or contains special characters, it may not be parsed correctly, leading to incorrect or inaccessible values.\n\nIn order to give an accurate answer on how to access the value \"zy\", I would need to see the actual JSON structure to determine the correct path."
