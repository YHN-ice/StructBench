Instead, a more dynamic approach would be necessary.\n\n5. **Type Errors**: Mistaking an object for an array or vice versa can lead to incorrect access patterns and type errors.\n\n6. **Typos and Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case sensitive. Typos or incorrect casing in key names can result in failing to retrieve the value.\n\n7. **Data Types**: Ensuring the correct data type is being accessed (e.g., string, number, boolean, null) is essential, as treating them incorrectly can lead to errors.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: Incorrect syntax in the path expression (such as missing brackets or quotes) can prevent access to the desired value.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one must carefully analyze the JSON structure, confirm the data types of the elements, and construct the access path accurately."
