Navigating through the correct hierarchy to reach the desired value can be challenging.\n\n2. **Key Names**: JSON keys are case-sensitive. Therefore, if the key is not referenced with the exact case, it may lead to an inability to access the value.\n\n3. **Arrays vs Objects**: JSON can contain both objects (denoted by curly braces `{}`) and arrays (denoted by square brackets `[]`). Knowing whether to use an index or a key at each level of the hierarchy is crucial.\n\n4. **Dynamic Structures**: If the structure of the JSON is dynamic and not known beforehand, it can be difficult to write a generic parser to access a given value.\n\n5. **Type Errors**: While accessing elements, there could be type errors if one tries to access a property on an undefined or null value, or attempts to treat a single object like an array or vice versa.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: Incorrect syntax such as missing brackets, quotes, or commas can lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Data Integrity Issues**: The JSON file might be incomplete, or have missing keys/values which could make it impossible to access certain data.\n\n8. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, there may be performance issues when parsing and searching for the required information.\n\nEach of these potential difficulties would require specific considerations when writing a parser or accessing elements within a JSON structure."
