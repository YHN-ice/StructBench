This can get confusing if the structure is deeply nested or complex.\n\n2. **Key names**: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so you must use the exact key names, including the correct case, to access the values.\n\n3. **Arrays**: If the JSON contains arrays, you'll need to know the index of the element you want to access. Remember that array indexing starts at 0.\n\n4. **Data types**: JSON supports different data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. You need to be aware of the data type you are trying to access to handle it correctly in your code.\n\n5. **Syntax errors**: When writing the path to access a value, syntax errors like missing brackets, quotes, or commas can result in failure to parse the JSON properly.\n\n6. **Dynamic keys or indices**: Sometimes, keys or indices may be dynamic or generated at runtime, making it difficult to hard-code the access path.\n\n7. **Size of the JSON**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be memory-intensive to load the entire file into memory at once.\n\n8. **Encoding issues**: If the JSON file uses a different encoding than what your parser expects, characters may not be read correctly.\n\n9. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, but if the file includes them (common in configuration files), a standard JSON parser will throw an error.\n\nOnce we know what the specific JSON looks like, we can determine a precise method to access the value \"e\"."
