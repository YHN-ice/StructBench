Properly navigating these structures without knowing their format can be challenging.\n\n2. **Key Names**: JSON object keys are case-sensitive. Therefore, 'Key', 'KEY', and 'key' would refer to different elements.\n\n3. **Array Indices**: If the value is located within an array, one needs to know the correct index to access it, and indices are zero-based.\n\n4. **Dynamic Structures**: The structure of the JSON might be dynamic, which means it could change over time or according to different conditions.\n\n5. **Missing Keys or Indices**: The key or index being referred to might not exist in the JSON, which would result in an error when trying to access it.\n\n6. **Data Types**: Ensuring the correct data type is being accessed is important. For example, trying to access an index on an object or a key on an array would result in an error.\n\n7. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to manually find the correct path to the desired value without automated tools or scripts.\n\n8. **Encoding and Character Sets**: The JSON file must be correctly encoded (usually UTF-8) and any special characters must be properly handled.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles can help in preparing a strategy to correctly parse the JSON file and access the desired values efficiently.
