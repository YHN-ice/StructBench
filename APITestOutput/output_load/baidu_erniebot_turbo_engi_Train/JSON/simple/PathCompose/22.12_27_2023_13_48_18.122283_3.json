Determining whether to use an index or a key at each level could be tricky.\n\n3. **Similar Keys:** If the JSON file contains keys with similar or identical names at different levels, it may be confusing to identify the correct path to the target value.\n\n4. **Type Errors:** JSON can store values as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null. One must ensure that they're accessing properties on objects or indices in arrays and not mistakenly trying to index into a string or access properties of a non-object.\n\n5. **Large Files:** If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to manually navigate through it to find the correct path. Tools or search functionalities would be needed.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors:** A single misplaced comma, bracket, or brace can cause a JSON file to be invalid, which would prevent proper parsing and accessing of data within.\n\n7. **Dynamic Keys:** Sometimes, keys in a JSON object may be dynamically generated and not known in advance, making it hard to predict the exact path without additional metadata or patterns.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues:** If the file encoding is not UTF-8 or if there are special characters, there might be issues reading the file correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would typically need to carefully examine the structure of the JSON file to understand its schema and hierarchy, use proper tools to navigate through the data if it's large or complex, and handle any data type or format issues appropriately."
