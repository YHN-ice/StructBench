Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise:\n\n1. Nested Structures: JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays. Navigating through these layers requires careful attention to the hierarchy and the keys used at each level.\n\n2. Similar Keys: If the JSON file contains keys with the same name at different levels, it's essential to ensure that the correct path is followed to access the intended value.\n\n3. Arrays vs. Objects: Knowing whether a particular level in the hierarchy is an object or an array is crucial because objects are accessed via keys, while arrays are accessed via indices.\n\n4. Data Types: Ensuring the correct data type is being accessed (e.g., string, integer, boolean) is important, especially if the JSON is being used for further processing.\n\n5. Index Out of Range: When accessing array elements, one must ensure that the index used is within the bounds of the array to avoid errors.\n\n6. Key Errors: If a key does not exist at a certain level, an error will occur. This can happen if there’s a typo in the key or a misunderstanding of the JSON structure.\n\n7. Dynamic Structure: If the structure of the JSON is dynamic or not well-defined, it may be difficult to predict the correct path to a value without additional context or metadata.\n\n8. Large Files: Large JSON files can be challenging to navigate and may require tools or scripts to parse effectively.\n\n9. Formatting: Poorly formatted JSON or missing delimiters can lead to parsing errors and difficulties in accessing values.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one should have a good understanding of the JSON format, and it may be helpful to use tools such as JSON linters or formatters to visualize and validate the structure of the JSON file."
