For example, trying to access an object when expecting an array could lead to errors.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: Incorrect syntax such as missing brackets, wrong key names, or incorrect index usage could lead to an inability to access the desired value.\n\n8. **Encoding and Escaping Issues**: Special characters in keys or string values may need proper handling to be accessed correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, I would need a clear and precise structure of the JSON file, including all necessary keys and indices leading to the desired value. Once I have this structure, I can provide the correct sequence to access value \"r\"."
