Distinguishing between these and using the correct index or key is essential.\n\n4. **Data Types:** Ensuring that the value accessed is of the expected data type (string, number, boolean, object, array) is crucial for accurate data retrieval.\n\n5. **Key Sensitivity:** JSON keys are case-sensitive. It is important to use the exact key as it appears in the JSON file.\n\n6. **Dynamic Structure:** If the structure of the JSON file is dynamic and changes frequently, a hardcoded path to access data might not always work.\n\n7. **Error Handling:** Proper error handling is necessary to account for missing keys or indices, which could lead to runtime errors if not checked.\n\n8. **Large Files:** If the JSON file is very large, it might be challenging to manually find the correct path to the desired value.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, one would need to carefully analyze the given JSON structure, use proper indexing for arrays, ensure correct key usage for objects, and implement error checking to handle missing or incorrect paths."
