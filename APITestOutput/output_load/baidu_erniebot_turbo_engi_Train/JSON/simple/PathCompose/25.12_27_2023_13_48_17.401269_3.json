Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise when trying to access a specific value like \"z\":\n\n1. Nested Structures: JSON files can have deeply nested structures with objects within objects or arrays within arrays. It is essential to navigate through these layers correctly.\n\n2. Array Indexing: If the value is within an array, one needs to know the correct index to access it. Indexing starts at 0, not 1.\n\n3. Key Sensitivity: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so \"Z\" and \"z\" would refer to different keys.\n\n4. Data Types: JSON supports several data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. It's important to know the type of the value associated with \"z\" to access it correctly.\n\n5. Missing Keys or Values: If the key \"z\" is missing or the value is null or undefined, it might cause errors.\n\n6. Syntax Errors: While writing the path to access \"z\", syntax errors such as missing brackets or incorrect punctuation could lead to an incorrect path.\n\n7. Large Files: In very large JSON files, it might be challenging to quickly find the key in question without a search function or proper formatting tools.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, one should:\n\n- Use a JSON viewer or formatter to visualize the structure of the JSON file.\n- Pay attention to the case of keys and indexing of arrays.\n- Follow the correct syntax for accessing objects (`obj[key]`) and arrays (`arr[index]`).\n- Handle cases where keys or values might be missing or null."

You can also use a JSON formatter or viewer to visually inspect the structure and verify that you are accessing the correct key."
