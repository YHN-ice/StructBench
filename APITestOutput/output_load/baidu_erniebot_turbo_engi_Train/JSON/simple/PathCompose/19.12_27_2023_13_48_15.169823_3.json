Ensuring the existence of a key before trying to access its value is important to avoid errors.\n\n4. **Data Types**: JSON supports various data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Knowing the type of data held by each key is crucial for accessing values correctly.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity**: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so 'Key' and 'key' would be considered different. It's essential to use the exact casing when trying to access values.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: Errors in the JSON syntax, such as missing commas or brackets, can lead to parsing errors which need to be corrected before accessing any values.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON file is not properly encoded (e.g., UTF-8), there might be issues with special characters or internationalization when parsing the file.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it is important to carefully navigate the structure of the JSON file, verify that keys exist before accessing them, and handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during the parsing process."
