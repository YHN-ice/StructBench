You can access the first object's id of `subs` using a nested dictionary lookup.\n3. **Identify the correct key**: In the parsed dictionary, locate the `subs` key to access the nested list of objects.\n4. **Extract the first object's id of subs**: Using a for loop or an iterator, iterate through the nested list and locate the first object with the `first_object_id` key that corresponds to your desired value. You can access this value using a dictionary lookup.\n\nHere's an example of how you can extract the first object's id of `subs`:\n\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# JSON content as a string\njson_content = \"\"\"\n{\n  \"id\": \"f\",\n  \"Z\": \"z\",\n  \"subs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"g\",\n      \"Y\": \"y\",\n      \"subs\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"h\",\n          \"X\": \"x\",\n          \"subs\": []\n        },\n        { \"first_object_id\": \"i\"} \n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Parse JSON content into Python dictionary\nparsed_json = json.loads(json_content)\n\n# Access nested list of objects and extract first object's id of subs\nfirst_object_id = parsed_json[\"subs\"][0][\"first_object_id\"]\nprint(first_object_id)  # Output: i\n```\nMake sure to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during parsing, such as malformed JSON or unexpected data types."
