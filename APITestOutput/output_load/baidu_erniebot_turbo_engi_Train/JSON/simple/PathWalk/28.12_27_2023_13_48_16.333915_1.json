The JSON content should be provided in a way that I can interpret since I cannot physically read files.\n\n2. **Parsing the JSON**: Once the JSON content is available, it needs to be correctly parsed. Errors in parsing could occur if the JSON is not properly formatted or contains syntax errors.\n\n3. **Finding the `subs` List**: Assuming the JSON is a hierarchical structure, I need to navigate to the correct level where the `subs` list is located. If there is no such named list or its name differs, it could be challenging to locate without further information.\n\n4. **Identifying the First Object**: In the `subs` list, we need to identify what is considered the \"first\" object. This typically means the object at index 0 of a JSON array.\n\n5. **Retrieving the `id` Value**: Within the first object in `subs`, there should be a field named `id`. It's important that this field exists and is accessible within the object.\n\n6. **Data Format Consistency**: The format of the `id` field should be consistent.
