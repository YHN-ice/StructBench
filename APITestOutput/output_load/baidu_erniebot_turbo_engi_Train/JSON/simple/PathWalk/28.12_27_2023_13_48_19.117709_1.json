If it contains a different data type, such as a string or an object, this could cause confusion.\n\n4. **Missing Data**: The `subs` array might be empty or may not exist at all in some objects, which would make it impossible to retrieve the first object's `id`.\n\n5. **Ambiguity in \"First\"**: Depending on the context, \"first\" could mean different things—either the first in a list ordered by insertion, by a specific attribute, or by default sorting criteria.\n\n6. **Multiple Occurrences**: There might be multiple occurrences of `subs` within the JSON file, and without a clear path provided, it could be unclear which one to refer to.\n\n7. **File Size and Memory Constraints**: If the JSON file is very large, it could pose memory constraints for processing, although this is less of a concern for modern systems with ample memory.\n\n8. **File Accessibility**: There could be issues accessing the file due to permissions or file system errors.\n\n9. **Parsing Errors**: If the JSON file contains syntax errors or is not properly formatted, this could result in parsing errors that prevent accessing the data.\n\n10. **Encoding Issues**: If the file uses a non-standard encoding that affects the readability of text or key names, it could hinder data extraction.\n\nOnce I have access to the JSON data, these obstacles can be more specifically addressed depending on the actual content and structure of the file."
