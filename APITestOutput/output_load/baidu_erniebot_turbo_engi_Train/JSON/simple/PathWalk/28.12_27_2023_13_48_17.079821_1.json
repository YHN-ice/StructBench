For example, there might be multiple \"subs\" fields nested at different levels, and it may not be clear which one you are referring to.\n\n5. **Encoding Issues**: There may be encoding issues with the file that could prevent proper parsing, such as if the file includes special characters or is not in UTF-8 encoding.\n\n6. **Key Naming Conventions**: The key 'id' within 'subs' must be clearly defined.
