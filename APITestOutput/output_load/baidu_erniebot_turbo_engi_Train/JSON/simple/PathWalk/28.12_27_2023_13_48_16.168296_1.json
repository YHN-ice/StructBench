Understanding the structure of the JSON is crucial.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Structure**: Without prior knowledge of the JSON structure, you might need additional context to understand what \"subs\" refers to (whether it's a top-level key, nested within another object, etc.).\n\n5. **Errors in Data**: If there are missing keys or null values where you expect data, it could complicate extracting the correct information.\n\n6. **Assuming Consistency**: There can be an assumption that all objects within an array follow the same structure.
