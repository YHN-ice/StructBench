Alternatively, the first object in the \"subs\" array may not have an \"id\" field.\n3. **Data Type Issues:** The \"id\" field in the object might not be of a consistent data type; it could be a string in some objects and an integer in others, which could lead to confusion if not handled correctly.\n4. **Large File Size:** If the JSON file is very large, it might be difficult to process it efficiently due to memory constraints.\n5. **Syntax Errors:** The JSON file could have syntax errors that make it invalid. Common errors include missing commas, unclosed brackets, or quotation marks.\n\nTo overcome these challenges:\n\n- I will need to ensure that the JSON is valid and properly formatted.\n- I will have to navigate through the JSON structure systematically to locate the \"subs\" array.\n- I will need to handle different data types for the \"id\" field if possible.\n- If the file size is large, I might need to stream the file or process it in chunks.\n\nOnce I have access to the JSON data, I can parse it and extract the required information.
