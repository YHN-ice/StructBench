If the data types are not correctly used or formatted, it can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Encoding Problems**: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8. If the file encoding is incorrect, it can cause issues when parsing.\n\n4. **Nesting and Hierarchy**: Incorrectly nested objects or arrays can create structural issues in JSON.\n\n5. **Large Files**: Very large JSON files might pose issues with memory consumption and performance when parsing.\n\n6. **Special Characters**: Special characters in strings must be properly escaped; otherwise, they can lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Duplicate Keys**: While JSON parsers typically handle duplicate keys within an object by overwriting the previous value with the last one encountered, this might not always be the desired behavior and could be considered a structural issue depending on the context.\n\n8. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments.
