An error might occur if the wrong data type is used.\n\n3. **Mismatched Brackets**: Every opening brace `{` must have a corresponding closing brace `}` and every opening bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing bracket `]`.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: Commas are used to separate elements, but there shouldn't be a comma after the last element in an object or array.\n\n5. **Duplicate Keys**: While JSON does not forbid duplicate keys in an object, most parsers will only recognize the last key-value pair, which is often not intended.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: JSON data should be encoded in UTF-8; other encodings might cause issues when parsing.\n\n7. **Nesting Errors**: Objects or arrays that are improperly nested can cause issues.\n\n8. **Incorrect Comments**: JSON does not officially support comments, and the inclusion of them can lead to errors.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the JSON file provided, it would signify a structural error."
