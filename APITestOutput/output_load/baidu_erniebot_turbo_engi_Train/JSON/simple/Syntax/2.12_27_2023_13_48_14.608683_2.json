Mistakes in data representation could cause errors.\n7. **Colon between key and value:** Each key-value pair in an object should be separated by a colon.\n8. **Encoding issues:** If the file uses an incorrect character encoding, some characters might not be represented correctly.\n\nTo determine if the given JSON file is free from structural errors, these are some of the potential issues that need to be checked.
