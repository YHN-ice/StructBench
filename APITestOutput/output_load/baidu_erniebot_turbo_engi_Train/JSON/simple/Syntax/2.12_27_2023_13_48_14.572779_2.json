Missing or extra commas: JSON requires commas between each key-value pair in an object, and each element in an array, but not after the last pair or element.\n\n2. Unquoted or incorrectly quoted keys: In JSON, keys must always be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Incorrect data types: JSON supports specific data types like strings (which must be in double quotes), numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. If a value is of an incorrect type, it's an error.\n\n4. Extra or missing braces or brackets: Every JSON object must be enclosed in curly braces `{}`, and every array must be enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Unbalanced or incorrectly placed braces or brackets can cause errors.\n\n5. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages, JSON does not allow a trailing comma after the last item in an array or the last key-value pair in an object.\n\n6. Syntax errors: This includes using single quotes instead of double quotes, having unescaped special characters within strings, or incorrect use of colons and equal signs.\n\nIf any of these structural issues are present in the JSON file you provide, it would render the JSON invalid, hence answering 'True' for errors. If the JSON is well-formed and free of such errors, the answer would be 'False'."
