Missing or extra commas can lead to structural errors.\n\n2. **Incorrect Brackets**: The use of curly brackets `{}` for objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays must be correct. Mismatched opening and closing brackets can cause errors.\n\n3. **Unquoted Strings**: In JSON, keys and string values should be enclosed in double quotes `\"`. Unquoted strings can result in invalid syntax.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: Although some parsers may tolerate trailing commas, standard JSON syntax does not allow a trailing comma after the last element in an array or the last member in an object.\n\n5. **Data Types**: All data types should conform to JSON standards (e.g., strings in double quotes, booleans as `true` or `false`, etc.).\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: Non-standard characters or improper encoding might cause errors during parsing.\n\n7. **Nested Structures**: Deeply nested objects or arrays could potentially cause confusion and lead to structural errors if not handled correctly.\n\n8. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments, and their presence would lead to errors.\n\n9. **Colon Separation**: In objects, members should have a key followed by a colon `:` and then the value. Missing colons can cause structural issues.\n\nIf any of these items are not formatted correctly, the JSON structure will be invalid. Once presented with the JSON file, these are the aspects that will be reviewed to determine whether there is a structural error."
