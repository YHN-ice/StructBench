Non-standard formatting: While JSON is quite tolerant of whitespace variations, inappropriate placement of spaces, tabs, or newline characters can make it harder to read and assess the structure quickly.\n\n2. Missing or extra commas: In JSON, objects (`{}`) and arrays (`[]`) elements should be separated by commas. A common mistake is to omit a comma or to include an extra one where it's not needed.\n\n3. Unbalanced braces or brackets: Every opening brace (`{`) or bracket (`[`) needs to have a corresponding closing brace (`}`) or bracket (`]`). Unbalanced delimiters can lead to structural errors.\n\n4. Incorrect data types: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Assigning an incorrect data type to a value can cause errors.\n\n5. Unquoted or improperly quoted keys or string values: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and missing quotes can lead to errors.\n\n6. Trailing commas: JSON does not allow a trailing comma after the last element in an object or array. This is different from some programming languages that may be more lenient with trailing commas.\n\n7. Syntax issues: Invalid syntax like missing colons between keys and values, or using an equals sign (`=`) instead of a colon (`:`) can cause errors.\n\n8. Nested structures: Deeply nested objects or arrays can sometimes make it difficult to keep track of the structure and can lead to mistakes.\n\n9. Encoding issues: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. Encoding issues might not be immediately visible but can cause problems when parsing the JSON.\n\n10. Comments: Standard JSON does not support comments. Including comments in a JSON file will cause it to be invalid.\n\nUnderstanding these common issues can help in effectively parsing and validating a JSON file. If the input file contains any of these errors, it would be deemed structurally incorrect."
