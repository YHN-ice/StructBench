Here are some common issues that might occur:\n\n1. Syntax Errors: JSON has a strict syntax. Common mistakes include missing or extra commas, unquoted or misquoted keys or string values, and misplaced curly or square brackets.\n\n2. Data Type Errors: JSON supports specific data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Using an unsupported data type or formatting a value incorrectly could lead to errors.\n\n3. Nesting Problems: Objects or arrays can be nested within each other, but incorrect nesting can cause structural errors.\n\n4. Trailing Commas: While some parsers may be forgiving, a trailing comma after the last key-value pair in an object or element in an array is not allowed in JSON.\n\n5. Encoding Issues: JSON text must be properly encoded (usually UTF-8). Any encoding mismatches could result in errors during parsing.\n\n6. Key Uniqueness: In a JSON object, each key should be unique within that object. Duplicate keys may cause unexpected behavior.\n\n7. Depth and Size Limitations: Some parsers might have limitations on how deeply nested a JSON structure can be or how large a file it can process.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the JSON file provided, it will lead to parsing errors or invalid JSON structure. Once I see the JSON input file, I'll be able to determine if any of these potential difficulties and obstacles are indeed present and whether they pose a problem for parsing the JSON correctly."
