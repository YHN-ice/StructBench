Common mistakes include missing commas, colons, or quotes, extra trailing commas, or using single quotes instead of double quotes.\n\n2. **Data Types**: JSON only supports certain data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). Errors can occur if the wrong data type is used.\n\n3. **Nesting and Hierarchies**: JSON objects and arrays can be nested within each other. Errors in nesting can lead to a malformed JSON structure.\n\n4. **Encoding Issues**: JSON should be UTF-8 encoded. If there are encoding issues, the parser may not be able to interpret the file correctly.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the JSON file is very large, it may be difficult to parse due to memory limitations or it could take a very long time to process.\n\n6. **Comments**: JSON does not support comments. If comments are included in a JSON file, it will result in an error.\n\n7. **Duplicate Keys**: Although JSON specification does not forbid duplicate keys in an object, they can lead to unexpected behavior because many parsers will only consider the last occurrence of the key.\n\nWithout seeing the specific JSON file, we cannot know which of these issues, if any, will apply. Once we see the JSON data provided, we can examine it for any structural errors.\n"
