Missing or extra commas: Each key-value pair in an object or each element in an array should be separated by a comma, but there shouldn't be a trailing comma after the last element.\n\n2. Unquoted keys: In JSON, keys must always be strings and thus should be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Single quotes: JSON requires double quotes for strings. Single quotes are not valid.\n\n4. Missing quotation marks: Both keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n5. Braces and brackets mismatch: All opened curly braces `{` and square brackets `[` must have a corresponding closing brace `}` or bracket `]`.\n\n6. Data types issues: Values must be of an appropriate data type (string, number, object, array, boolean, or null). For instance, strings should be in quotes, and booleans should be in lowercase (`true` or `false`).\n\n7. Nested objects or arrays issues: If objects or arrays are nested within each other, their syntax must also be correct according to the above rules.\n\n8.
