Unquoted keys or strings: In JSON, keys and strings should be surrounded by double quotes. Single quotes are not valid.\n\n3. Trailing commas: JSON does not allow trailing commas after the last element in an object or array.\n\n4. Improper nesting: Objects or arrays must be properly nested within braces `{}` for objects and brackets `[]` for arrays.\n\n5. Syntax errors: Any deviation from the correct syntax, such as missing brackets or braces, can lead to errors.\n\n6. Data type errors: JSON supports specific data types, such as numbers, strings, Booleans, null, objects, and arrays. Inserting an unsupported data type or formatting a value incorrectly (like missing quotes around a string) will cause an error.\n\n7. Encoding issues: JSON should be encoded in UTF-8 without BOM (Byte Order Mark).
