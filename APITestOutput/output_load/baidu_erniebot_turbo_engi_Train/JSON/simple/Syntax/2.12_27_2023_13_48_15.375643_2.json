Missing or extra commas: JSON requires commas between each key-value pair within an object and between array elements. An extra comma at the end of a list or the lack of a comma between elements can result in an error.\n\n2. Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and string values: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\"). Single quotes ('') are not valid for enclosing keys or string values.\n\n3. Braces and square brackets mismatch: The objects should be enclosed within curly braces ({}), and arrays should be enclosed within square brackets ([]). Missing or mismatching opening and closing brackets can cause errors.\n\n4. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types like strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Inserting values that don't conform to these data types (like undefined or functions) is a common error.\n\n5. Trailing commas: JSON does not support trailing commas after the last element in an object or array.\n\n6. Syntax errors: Any deviation from the proper syntax, such as missing colons between keys and values or using invalid characters, will result in an error.\n\nNow, please provide the JSON file so I can check it for structural errors."
