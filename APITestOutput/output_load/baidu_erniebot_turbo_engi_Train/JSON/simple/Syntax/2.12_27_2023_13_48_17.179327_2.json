A common mistake is to include an extra comma after the last element or member or forget to include a comma where necessary.\n\n2. **Mismatched braces and brackets**: Every opening brace `{` must have a corresponding closing brace `}`, and every opening bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing bracket `]`. Unbalanced or mismatched braces and brackets will cause a structural error.\n\n3. **Improper use of quotes**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes `\"`. Single quotes `'` are not valid, and unquoted keys or values will lead to errors.\n\n4. **Data types issues**: JSON has specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. A structural error can occur if a value is of an incorrect type (e.g., a string that isn't quoted).\n\n5. **Trailing commas**: Some parsers do not allow trailing commas after the last element of an array or the last member of an object.\n\n6. **Encoding issues**: The JSON format requires a specific character encoding (usually UTF-8). If the file has encoding issues, it might lead to parsing errors.\n\n7. **Comments**: Standard JSON does not support comments. Including comments within JSON can cause errors during parsing.\n\n8. **Nested structures**: Deeply nested structures may sometimes cause confusion and lead to structural errors if not handled correctly.\n\nOnce I've seen the input file, I can assess it for any of these common issues and confirm whether or not there is a structural error."
