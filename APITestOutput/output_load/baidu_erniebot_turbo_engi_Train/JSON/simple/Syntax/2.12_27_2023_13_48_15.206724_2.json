Unwrapped strings or strings wrapped in single quotes are not valid JSON.\n\n3. **Trailing commas**: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas, JSON does not permit a trailing comma after the last element in an array or the last member in an object.\n\n4. **Unquoted keys**: In JSON, all keys must be in double quotes. Keys without quotes or with single quotes are invalid.\n\n5. **Incorrect nesting**: Objects or arrays that are not properly nested can cause issues. For instance, an array should not end with a curly brace, or an object should not end with a square bracket.\n\n6. **Data type issues**: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, true, false, null). Any deviation from these expected types (like an undefined value or a function) is an error.\n\n7. **Syntax errors**: Any general syntax errors, such as missing brackets or braces to close objects or arrays, will result in an incorrect JSON structure.\n\nOnce you provide the JSON file, I will proceed to analyze it for any of these potential structural errors.
