Common mistakes include trailing commas, missing quotes, improper use of braces and brackets, etc. Any of these will lead to a parsing error.\n\n2. **Data Type Issues**: JSON supports specific data types like strings, numbers, arrays, objects, booleans, and null. Errors can occur if values are not properly represented with the correct data type.\n\n3. **Encoding Problems**: JSON text must be encoded in UTF-8. If the encoding is incorrect, the parser may fail to interpret the file correctly.\n\n4. **Nested Structures**: JSON files can contain nested arrays and objects. Errors may arise if nested structures are not closed properly with the correct set of brackets or braces.\n\n5. **Key-Value Pairs**: Every key must be a string and followed by a colon before its value. Any deviation from this format could result in an error.\n\n6. **Large File Sizes**: If the JSON file is too large, it could cause memory issues for the parser or make it difficult to spot errors manually.\n\n7. **Comments**: JSON does not officially support comments. If comments are included in a JSON file, it is likely to cause a parsing error.\n\n8. **Duplicate Keys**: While JSON parsers might handle duplicate keys in different ways (ignoring all but the last key-value pair, for example), they are generally considered bad practice and could be a source of error.\n\n9. **Special Characters**: Special characters in strings need to be escaped properly. If they are not, this might lead to parsing errors.\n\n10. **Conformance to Standards**: The JSON file must conform to the JSON format standards as per RFC 7159/ECMA-404.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the JSON file, it would be deemed as having structural errors. However, as an AI text-based model I cannot directly parse or validate a JSON file without first seeing it as text input. Once provided with the JSON text, I can analyze and indicate whether there are structural errors or not."
