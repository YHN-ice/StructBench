Missing or extra commas: JSON objects and arrays use commas to separate elements, and a missing or extra comma can break the structure.\n2. Unquoted keys: In JSON, keys must always be enclosed in double quotes. Unquoted keys are a common mistake.\n3. Incorrect quotation marks: JSON requires double quotes for strings. Single quotes are not valid.\n4. Trailing commas: Having a comma after the last element in an object or array is not allowed in JSON.\n5. Mismatched braces or brackets: Every opening curly brace `{` must have a corresponding closing brace `}`, and every opening bracket `[` must have a corresponding closing bracket `]`.\n6. Improper data types: JSON has specific data types (e.g., strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, null). If a value does not match its expected data type, it can cause an error.\n7. Invalid characters: Illegal characters within the JSON structure can cause parsing to fail.\n8. Nested errors: Errors within a nested object or array can propagate and cause parsing to fail at higher levels.\n\nIf any of these errors are present in the JSON file, it would make the file structurally incorrect and parsing would fail.
