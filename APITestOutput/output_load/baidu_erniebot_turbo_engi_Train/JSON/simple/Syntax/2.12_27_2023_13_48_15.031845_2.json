Values assigned to wrong types or improper formatting (e.g., non-quoted strings) can cause parsing errors.\n\n3. **Encoding Issues:** If the JSON file is not properly encoded as UTF-8 or contains invalid characters, it could cause parsing problems.\n\n4. **Nested Objects/Arrays Complexity:** Deeply nested objects or arrays could be prone to mistakes such as mismatched opening and closing brackets or braces.\n\n5. **Comments:** Standard JSON does not support comments. If there are any comments within the JSON file, it will lead to errors during parsing.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Key-Value Pairs:** Keys should be unique within an object, and each key-value pair must be separated by a comma. If there are duplicate keys or missing commas, this could be an issue.\n\nLet me know when you're ready to provide the JSON content, and I'll check for any structural errors present within it."
