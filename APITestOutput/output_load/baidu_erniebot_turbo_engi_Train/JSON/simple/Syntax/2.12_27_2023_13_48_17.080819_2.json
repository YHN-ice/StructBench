Trailing commas: While some programming languages or parsers allow trailing commas in objects or arrays, they are not allowed in a valid JSON file.\n\n4. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null). An error could arise if a value is not of an expected or supported type.\n\n5. Nested structures: Errors in nested objects or arrays could make the JSON invalid.\n\n6.
