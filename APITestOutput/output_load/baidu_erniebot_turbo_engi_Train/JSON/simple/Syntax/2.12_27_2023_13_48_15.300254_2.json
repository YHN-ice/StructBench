Single quotes are not valid.\n\n3. **Unquoted Keys**: Keys must always be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas**: Unlike some programming languages that allow trailing commas in arrays and objects, JSON does not allow this.\n\n5. **Colon Issues**: In key-value pairs, the key and value must be separated by a colon, and there should not be a comma between the key and the colon.\n\n6. **Data Types**: Values must be of an appropriate data type (string, number, object, array, true, false, or null).\n\n7. **Braces and Brackets Matching**: Open curly braces `{` and square brackets `[` must be properly matched with their closing counterparts `}` and `]`.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: Any deviation from the proper JSON format, such as improper escaping of characters within strings.\n\n9. **Encoding Issues**: The file encoding might not be UTF-8, which can cause problems if there are special characters in the strings.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the JSON file you provide me, it would be considered structurally incorrect.
