Missing or extra commas: Objects and arrays in JSON must have commas separating their elements, but an extra comma at the end or a missing comma between elements is an error.\n\n2. Incorrect use of quotes: In JSON, keys and string values are surrounded by double quotes. Missing quotes, incorrect single quotes, or unescaped quotes within strings can cause errors.\n\n3. Brackets and braces mismatch: Every opening bracket '[' must have a corresponding closing bracket ']', and every opening brace '{' must have a corresponding closing brace '}'.\n\n4. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types such as string, number, object, array, true, false, and null. Mismatched or incorrectly formatted data types could lead to errors.\n\n5. Unescaped control characters: Special characters like newline (\\n), tab (\\t), or carriage return (\\r) inside strings need to be properly escaped.\n\n6. Leading zeros or plus signs in numbers: JSON does not allow numbers to have leading zeros or plus signs.\n\n7. Trailing commas: Unlike some programming languages, JSON does not allow trailing commas in arrays or objects.\n\n8. Syntax errors: Any deviations from the JSON format specification will result in syntax errors.\n\nIf the JSON file has any of these issues, it will be considered to have structural errors.
