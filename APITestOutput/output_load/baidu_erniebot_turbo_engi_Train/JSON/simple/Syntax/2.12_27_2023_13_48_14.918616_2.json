An error could arise from using an unsupported data type or not representing the supported types correctly (e.g., unquoted strings).\n\n3. **Key-Value Pairs:** In JSON objects, each key must be a string and followed by a colon before its value. Errors can occur if keys are not in quotes, are missing colons, or if there are duplicates.\n\n4. **Nesting and Hierarchy:** JSON allows objects and arrays to be nested within each other. Errors may surface if the nesting is inconsistent or improperly formatted.\n\n5. **Encoding:** JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8. If the file is not correctly encoded, that could cause issues.\n\n6. **Comments:** Standard JSON does not support comments. If there are comments in the file, it's not valid JSON.\n\n7. **File Extension:** The file should typically have a .json extension to be recognized as a JSON file.\n\nOnce I see the actual JSON input, I will check for these potential issues and identify if there are any structural errors."
