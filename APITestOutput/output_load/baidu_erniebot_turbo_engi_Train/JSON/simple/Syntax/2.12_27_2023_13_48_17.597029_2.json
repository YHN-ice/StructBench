Similarly, arrays are collections of values separated by commas. Missing or extra commas can lead to syntax errors.\n\n2. **Improper Quotation**: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid and the lack of quotes around keys or string values is also an error.\n\n3. **Data Types**: JSON supports specific data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Assigning an incorrect data type or using unsupported data types could lead to errors.\n\n4. **Braces and Brackets**: JSON uses curly braces `{}` to denote objects and square brackets `[]` to denote arrays. Mismatched opening and closing braces or brackets will result in structural errors.\n\n5. **Colon Usage**: In JSON, a colon `:` separates keys from values within an object. Missing colons or incorrect use of other characters can cause errors.\n\n6. **Trailing Commas**: Trailing commas after the last key/value pair in an object or the last value in an array are not permitted in JSON and will result in an error.\n\n7. **Nested Structures**: Errors in nested objects or arrays might be harder to spot since they can be deeply integrated into the structure.\n\n8. **Encoding Issues**: JSON text should be encoded in UTF-8, and any deviations might cause issues when parsing.\n\nOnce we see the actual JSON content, we can check for these and other potential issues that might indicate structural errors."
