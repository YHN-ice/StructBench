Common errors include missing or extra commas, missing quotation marks around strings, or curly braces/brackets not being properly opened and closed.\n\n2. **Data types**: JSON supports specific data types, and an error might arise if the data is not correctly formatted according to these types (e.g., strings must be in double quotes, booleans in lowercase).\n\n3. **Nested structures**: JSON can have complex nested structures, which can sometimes lead to confusion or errors if not properly followed.\n\n4. **Large files**: Very large JSON files may pose performance issues or be challenging to parse completely without streaming the data. \n\n5. **Encoding issues**: If a JSON file is not properly encoded (UTF-8 is standard), there may be issues with special characters or international text.\n\n6. **Comments**: JSON does not natively support comments, and any comments in the JSON file will result in an error.\n\n7. **Trailing commas**: While some programming languages accept trailing commas in lists or objects, JSON does not, and this could cause an error.\n\nTo accurately assess if there's a structural error, I would need to review the JSON file content. Please provide the JSON file you'd like me to parse and evaluate for errors."
