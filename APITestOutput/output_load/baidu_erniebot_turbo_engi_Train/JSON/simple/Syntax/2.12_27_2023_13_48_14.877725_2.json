Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and strings: In JSON, keys and strings must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid, and missing quotes can result in errors.\n3. Braces and brackets mismatch: Curly braces `{}` denote objects and square brackets `[]` denote arrays. Each opening brace or bracket must have a corresponding closing one.\n4. Data types errors: JSON supports specific data types, such as strings, numbers, arrays, objects, booleans, and null. Inserting data of an unsupported type or misrepresenting a data type could cause errors.\n5. Trailing commas: Although some parsers may tolerate trailing commas, they are not allowed in the JSON format and can cause errors in strict parsers.\n\nPlease provide the JSON content so I can check for any structural errors."
