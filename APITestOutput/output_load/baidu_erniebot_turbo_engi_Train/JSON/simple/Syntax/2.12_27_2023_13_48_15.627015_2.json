Missing commas can break the structure, as can extra commas where they are not needed (e.g., after the last element in an object or array).\n\n2. **Mismatched Brackets**: JSON uses curly braces `{}` to denote objects and square brackets `[]` to denote arrays. A common mistake is mismatched opening and closing brackets, which would invalidate the JSON structure.\n\n3. **Unquoted Keys**: In JSON, keys must always be strings and therefore should be enclosed in double quotes. Unquoted keys can cause parsing errors.\n\n4. **Improperly Formatted Strings**: Strings in JSON must be enclosed in double quotes and certain characters within strings need to be escaped (e.g., double quotes inside the string, backslashes, etc.).\n\n5. **Data Types Errors**: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, boolean, null). Inserting data of an incorrect type (like an undefined or function type in JavaScript) would be a structural error.\n\n6. **Trailing Commas**: Having a comma after the last key-value pair in an object or the last value in an array is not allowed in JSON and will cause an error.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues**: If the JSON text is not properly encoded as UTF-8 or if there are invalid characters present, it can cause issues during parsing.\n\n8. **Nested Errors**: In complex JSON with nested objects or arrays, it's possible for errors to occur deep within the structure that can be harder to spot at a glance.\n\n9. **Incorrect Use of Quotes**: Using single quotes instead of double quotes, or inconsistent use of quotes can result in errors.\n\n10. **No Value or Key**: Omitting a key or value could also lead to structural issues.\n\nOnce I see the actual JSON input file, I can then parse it to determine if any of these issues or other structural problems are present."
