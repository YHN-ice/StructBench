Unmatched or missing brackets and braces: Curly braces `{}` denote objects, and square brackets `[]` denote arrays. They must be properly opened and closed in matched pairs.\n\n3. Incorrect use of quotes: Keys and string values should be enclosed in double quotes `\"`.\n\n4. Trailing commas: JSON does not allow a trailing comma after the last key-value pair in an object or the last value in an array.\n\n5. Data type errors: Values must be of the correct data type (e.g., strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null).\n\n6.
