A common error is either adding an extra comma or forgetting one.\n\n2. **Improper Quotation Marks:** In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes are not valid and can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Data Types:** JSON supports specific data types. An error may occur if the wrong data type is used, such as putting quotes around a number or boolean value.\n\n4. **Curly Braces and Square Brackets:** A JSON object must start with a curly brace `{` and end with a `}`. Arrays start with a square bracket `[` and end with `]`. Unmatched or misplaced braces or brackets will result in an error.\n\n5. **Colon Separation:** In JSON, key-value pairs must be separated by a colon `:`. Forgetting the colon or using a different character can lead to an error.\n\n6. **Non-Standard Elements:** Comments or functions are not standard in JSON and will lead to errors if included.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues:** If the file contains invalid characters or has encoding issues, it might not be parsed correctly.\n\n8. **Nested Structures:** Complex nested structures can sometimes lead to errors if they are not correctly constructed.\n\n9. **Trailing Commas:** Some parsers do not accept trailing commas after the last element in an object or array.\n\n10. **File Size and Complexity:** Very large or complex JSON files might push the limits of the parser, depending on its capabilities.\n\nOnce I review the input file, I'll be able to identify if any of these potential issues are present."
