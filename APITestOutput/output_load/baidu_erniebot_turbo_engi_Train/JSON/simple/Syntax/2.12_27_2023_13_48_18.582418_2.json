If there are missing or extra commas, brackets, braces, or quotation marks, the JSON structure will be invalid.\n\n2. **Data Types Issues**: JSON supports data types such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null. Issues may arise if the values are not properly enclosed (e.g., strings are not within quotes or numbers are quoted).\n\n3. **Nested Complexity**: JSON files can have complex nested structures. If there are mistakes in how objects or arrays are nested within each other, it could lead to structural errors.\n\n4. **Trailing commas**: Having a trailing comma after the last key-value pair in an object or after the last element in an array is not allowed in JSON. This often leads to parsing errors.\n\n5. **Encoding Problems**: If the file encoding is not UTF-8 or contains invalid characters, it could cause issues in parsing.\n\n6. **Property Uniqueness**: In a JSON object, each key should be unique. If there are duplicate keys, this might be considered a structural error depending on the parser's strictness.\n\n7. **File Accessibility**: If the file is not accessible or cannot be read due to permissions or other IO-related issues, parsing will be obstructed.\n\nOnce the parser begins processing the JSON input, it will check for these potential errors in structure and formatting.
