A missing comma can lead to a parsing error.\n\n2. **Extra Commas**: Likewise, an extra comma at the end of a list of elements in an array or a list of key-value pairs in an object (trailing commas) can cause some JSON parsers to fail, although some modern implementations may allow them.\n\n3. **Mismatched Brackets and Braces**: Every opening brace `{` and bracket `[` should have a corresponding closing brace `}` and bracket `]`. Mismatches can cause structural errors.\n\n4. **Incorrect Quotes**: JSON requires double quotes `\"` for wrapping keys and string values. Single quotes `'` or absence of quotes will result in an error.\n\n5. **Data Type Issues**: JSON has specific data types (string, number, object, array, boolean, null). Assigning an incorrect data type to a value can result in an error.\n\n6. **Unescaped Characters**: Certain characters need to be escaped in JSON strings (like backslash `\\`, double quotes `\"`, etc.). If they are not escaped properly, they can cause parsing errors.\n\n7. **Key Duplication**: While not necessarily a structural error in all contexts, having duplicate keys within an object can lead to unexpected behavior and is generally considered poor practice.\n\n8. **Syntax Errors**: Any deviation from the JSON syntax (such as using JavaScript comments or undefined values like `undefined`) will cause a JSON parser to fail.\n\nIdentifying structural errors requires carefully examining the JSON file's syntax and structure to ensure it adheres to the JSON specification."
