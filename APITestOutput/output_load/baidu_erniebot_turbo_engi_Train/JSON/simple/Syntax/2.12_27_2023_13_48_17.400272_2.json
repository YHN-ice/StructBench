Incorrect usage of these types can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Duplicate Keys:** While JSON syntax allows duplicate keys within an object, it is generally considered an error because most parsers will only recognize the last key-value pair, which may lead to unexpected results.\n\n4. **Trailing Commas:** Trailing commas at the end of lists or objects are not allowed in JSON and will cause an error.\n\n5. **Improper Encoding:** JSON files should be encoded in UTF-8 without a byte order mark (BOM). Improper encoding may cause parsing errors.\n\n6. **Nesting and Size Issues:** Extremely deep nesting or very large files could potentially cause issues with parsing due to limitations in the parser or available memory.\n\n7. **Comments:** JSON does not natively support comments, and any form of comments will lead to a parsing error.\n\nOnce the JSON file is presented, these points will be taken into consideration to analyze and determine any structural errors present in the file."
