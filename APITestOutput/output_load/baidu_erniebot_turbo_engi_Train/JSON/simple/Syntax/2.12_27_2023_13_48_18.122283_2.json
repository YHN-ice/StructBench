Common structural errors in JSON files include:\n\n1. Missing or extra commas: Every item in an array or every key-value pair in an object should be separated by a comma, but the last item/pair should not have a trailing comma.\n\n2. Unquoted or improperly quoted keys and string values: In JSON, keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes.\n\n3. Incorrect use of brackets: Arrays should be enclosed in square brackets `[]`, and objects should be enclosed in curly braces `{}`.\n\n4. Data type issues: JSON supports specific data types like numbers (without quotes), booleans (true/false without quotes), null (without quotes), objects, and arrays. Inserting an unsupported data type or formatting a supported type incorrectly would result in an error.\n\n5. Nested structure errors: Errors can occur if objects or arrays are not properly nested within each other.\n\n6. Trailing characters: Any characters following the last closing bracket can lead to errors.\n\nWhen you present the JSON file, I will check for these common issues and others that may arise to determine if there are any structural errors."
