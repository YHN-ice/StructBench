Efficient parsing algorithms might be needed to handle large files without excessive memory usage or processing time.\n\n4. **Complex Tree Structures**: Trees with many nodes, deep nesting, or unbalanced shapes might complicate the process of determining the height.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The tree file might contain errors or inconsistencies, such as missing nodes, incorrect links, or cycles that contradict the tree structure.\n\n6. **Recursion/Iteration Limits**: Calculating the height of a tree often involves recursive algorithms.
