If the tree is large or complex, finding the path to a specific node (like node 'ff') could require significant traversal logic.\n\n4. **Non-unique Node Identifiers**: If the tree contains non-unique identifiers (for example, multiple nodes with the same name), it could be challenging to identify which path leads to the intended 'ff' node.\n\n5. **Incorrect Tree Structure**: If there are errors in the tree structure (such as cycles, which should not exist in a tree), this would complicate the pathfinding process.\n\n6. **File Reading Errors**: Issues with file encoding, access permissions, or file corruption could prevent reading the input file correctly.\n\n7. **Performance Issues**: For very large trees, performance can become an issue when trying to find a path.
