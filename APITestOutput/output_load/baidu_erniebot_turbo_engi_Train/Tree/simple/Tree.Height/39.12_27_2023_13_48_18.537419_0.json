Large File Size: If the Tree file is very large, it could pose a problem in terms of memory management and processing time.\n\n3. Nesting and Recursion: Trees can have multiple levels of nesting, and handling recursion properly is essential to navigate through the nodes and calculate the height.\n\n4. Missing or Incorrect Data: If the Tree file contains incomplete information or errors in the data, it might lead to incorrect calculations of the tree's height.\n\n5.
