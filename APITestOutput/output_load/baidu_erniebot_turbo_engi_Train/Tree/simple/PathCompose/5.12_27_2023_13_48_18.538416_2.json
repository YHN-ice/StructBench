Navigating the tree will depend on understanding the specific format.\n\n2. File Parsing: Depending on the format of the tree file, parsing it correctly to extract the nodes and their relationships might be challenging.\n\n3. Identifying Nodes: The node 'vd' needs to be uniquely identifiable. If there are multiple nodes with the same identifier or if 'vd' is not clearly labeled, it may be difficult to determine which path to follow.\n\n4. Hierarchical Relationships: We need to understand and maintain the parent-child relationships between nodes to trace a path correctly.\n\n5.
