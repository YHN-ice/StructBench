For example, there might be multiple nodes labeled 'pc', which would require additional context to identify the correct one.\n\n3. **Large File Size**: If the tree file is very large, it may take more time to parse through the file, and there's a greater chance of running into performance issues or missing details.\n\n4. **Incorrect File Format**: If the input file does not follow a standard or expected format for a tree structure, it may require additional steps to interpret or preprocess the data before parsing.\n\n5. **Circular References**: Ideally, trees should not have circular references; however, if the file mistakenly contains them, it would make it difficult to find a path since there would be no clear \"root\" to \"leaf\" progression.\n\n6. **Misleading Indentation or Symbols**: The representation of the tree structure is often dependent on indentation or symbols like ->.
