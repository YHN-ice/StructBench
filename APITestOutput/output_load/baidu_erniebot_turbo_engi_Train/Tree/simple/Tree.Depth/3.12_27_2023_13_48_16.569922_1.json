        "As per your question, you want to know the depth of node \"mc\". Based on the provided tree structure, here's my analysis:\n\nThe root node (t) has a depth of 0. The next level down contains nodes u, v, w, x, y, z. Each of these nodes has a depth of 1. Node ab has a depth of 2 because it is directly connected to node v. Node fb has a depth of 3 because it is directly connected to node v and also indirectly connected to node t through node u. And so on.\n\nIf we follow the path from the root to node \"mc\", it is directly connected to node v and indirectly connected to node t through node u and fb. Therefore, the depth of node \"mc\" is 4.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is: \"mc\" has a depth of 4."
