If someone is exactly 176 cm tall, it needs to be determined if that person should be counted or not.\n\n6. **Data Format and Parsing Issues**: The datatable might be presented in a format that is not straightforward to parse, such as PDFs, images, or poorly structured CSVs.\n\n7. **Performance and Efficiency**: If the dataset is very large, finding the most efficient way to parse and analyze the data might be an obstacle.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Location of Work**: There might be ambiguity about whether \"work in NY\" refers only to the current location of work or if it includes past locations as well.\n\n9. **Correlation Between Rows**: Ensuring that rows with the same primeKey truly refer to the same person and that there are no errors in key assignment is essential for accurate aggregation of information.\n\n10. **Robustness of Code**: The code used to parse and analyze the data must be robust enough to handle edge cases and unexpected data entries.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful planning and execution when parsing and analyzing the provided datatables."
