        "Hi, the data you provided includes the height of people who work in HI. The height is given in centimeters.\n\nTo answer your question, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Parse the data table to extract the rows related to HI.\n2. Filter out the rows where the height is greater than 176 cm.\n3. Count the number of people who meet this criteria.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n### Step 1: Parse the data table\n\nFirst, you will need to parse the data table based on the primary key (primeKey). You will have to group by primeKey to correctly count individuals who work in HI. This will ensure that you are not counting individuals multiple times.\n\n### Step 2: Filter out rows with height greater than 176 cm\n\nAfter parsing, you will need to filter out the rows where the height is greater than 176 cm. You can use a WHERE clause in your SQL query or use a programming language like Python or R to filter the rows based on the condition.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of people\n\nFinally, you will need to count the number of people who meet this criteria. You can use a COUNT function in SQL or use a programming language to count the number of rows that meet this condition.\n\nBased on these steps, you should be able to accurately answer the question about how many people who work in HI are taller than 176 cm. Please let me know if you have any further questions or need help with implementing these steps."
