For example, heights could be in different units (meters, centimeters, inches) or formats (151, 151cm, 1.51m), and locations could be abbreviated differently (WA, Wa., Washington).\n\n2. **Incomplete Data:** Some rows might have missing information for height or work location, making it difficult to determine if a person meets both criteria.\n\n3. **Duplicates or Inconsistent Entries:** The same person might appear more than once in the dataset with slightly different entries, making it hard to accurately count unique individuals without a proper deduplication strategy based on the 'primeKey'.\n\n4. **Large Dataset Size:** If the dataset is very large, it could be computationally intensive to process and filter through all the data to find the relevant rows.\n\n5. **Data Spanning Multiple Tables or Formats:** The relevant information about height and work location might be spread across different tables or sections of the data, thereby requiring a join or consolidation process before filtering.\n\n6. **Ambiguities in Criteria:** The cutoff 'taller than 151' needs to be understood correctly – does it include exactly 151, or is it strictly greater than 151?\n\n7. **Errors and Outliers:** The dataset could contain errors or outlier values that don't make sense (e.g., a height of 15 or 1510), which would need to be handled appropriately.\n\n8. **Data Privacy and Ethics:** Depending on the source of the data, there may be privacy concerns related to processing personally identifiable information.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we'll need to carefully preprocess the data to normalize formats, handle missing or inconsistent entries, deduplicate where necessary, and apply the correct logical conditions to filter the dataset based on the given criteria. Now, please provide the datatable so we can proceed with finding the answer."
