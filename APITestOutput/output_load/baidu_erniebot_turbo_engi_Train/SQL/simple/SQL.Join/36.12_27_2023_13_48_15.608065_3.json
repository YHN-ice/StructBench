Potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process of providing the correct answer include:\n\n1. Inconsistent Data Formats: Heights and work locations may be recorded in various formats, requiring normalization for accurate comparison.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some entries might have incomplete information regarding height or work location, which could affect the count.\n\n3. Data Entry Errors: Typos or incorrect data could lead to misclassification of individuals.\n\n4. Multiple Entries: The same person could appear multiple times in the datatable. Without proper care, they might be counted more than once, skewing the results.\n\n5. Ambiguity in Location Abbreviations: If the location is recorded as an abbreviation like \"HI,\" it must be clear that it refers to Hawaii and not potentially something else.\n\n6. Units of Measurement: It must be clear whether height is in centimeters, inches, or another unit. For comparison purposes, the unit of measurement must be consistent across all records.\n\n7. Distinction Between Residence and Workplace: Ensuring that \"work in HI\" refers to the actual workplace location, not just the person's residence.\n\n8. Performance Issues: If the datatable is exceptionally large, it could pose performance issues when parsing and filtering through the data.\n\nOnce these potential issues are addressed and if the datatable is provided, I can proceed to parse the information to answer the question accurately."

They are:\n\nc (male, height: 187),\nd (male, height: 153) and\nd (male, height: 153).\n\nSo, the answer is 3.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the height information provided is in units of centimeters. If you have provided the information in other units (e.g., inches), then the results would be different.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with the data analysis, please let me know and I will be happy to assist you further."
