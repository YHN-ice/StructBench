        "In this question, you want to know how many people who work in New York are taller than 179 cm. To answer this question, you can perform a count operation on the dataset using a query that selects the rows where the company column equals 'NY' and the height column is greater than 179 cm. Assuming the table name is 'table_name', the query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name WHERE company = 'NY' AND height > 179\n```\n\nAfter running this query, you will get the total number of people who work in New York and are taller than 179 cm."
