Data spread across multiple rows: If the information about a person's work location and height is spread across different rows with the same primeKey, care must be taken to properly join this information.\n\n5. Ambiguity in units: If the units for height are not specified (e.g., centimeters, inches), there could be confusion in determining who is taller than 175.\n\n6.
