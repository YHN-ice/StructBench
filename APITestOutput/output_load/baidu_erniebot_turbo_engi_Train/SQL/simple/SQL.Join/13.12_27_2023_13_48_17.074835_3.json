Inconsistent Data Formatting: If the height data is not consistently formatted (e.g., a mix of cm, meters, or feet and inches), converting all measurements to the same unit would be necessary.\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: If some entries are missing the height or location information, those entries cannot be counted accurately.\n\n3. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows or Tables: If an individual's employment information is in a different row or table from their height information (but linked by a primeKey), it will be necessary to correctly join or look up across these rows or tables to get a complete picture.\n\n4. Variations in Location Representation: Location data might be represented in different ways (e.g., \"WA,\" \"Washington,\" \"W.A.,\" etc.), so you would need to account for all possible variations when filtering for people who work in WA.\n\n5. Data Errors: Incorrect data entry could lead to counting errors. For example, an individual might be incorrectly marked as working in WA or their height might be inaccurately recorded.\n\n6. Data Parsing: The data tables need to be correctly parsed to identify the relevant fields for location and height.\n\n7. Duplication of Records: If the data has duplicates (individuals represented more than once in the data set), it will be important to identify and count each individual only once.\n\n8.
