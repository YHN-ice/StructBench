        "The question you raised involves counting people who work in Texas and have a height greater than 180. Here are the steps you can take to address this question:\n\n1. Normalize the data: Ensure that all heights are in the same unit (such as centimeters), and that the state codes are consistently formatted (uppercase).\n2. Handle missing data: If there are any records with missing height or state information, you can either exclude those records or use some method to fill in the missing values (e.g., using the average height for a given gender and age group).\n3. Use deduplication: To avoid counting people multiple times due to duplicate records, use the primeKey to remove the duplicates.\n4. Validate the data: Check for any inaccuracies in the data entries (such as typo errors in the state code or height).\n5. Perform efficient querying: If the dataset is large, you can use efficient parsing and counting methods to avoid performance issues.\n6. Apply filters: Apply filters to the dataset to only include people who work in Texas and have a height greater than 180.\n7. Use appropriate statistical methods: Depending on the nature of the dataset, you may need to use appropriate statistical methods (such as sampling) to arrive at accurate results.\n\nAfter applying these strategies, you should be able to answer the question with confidence. If you encounter any further difficulties, please provide more details and I will do my best to assist you further."
