Care must be taken to count each person only once.\n\n4. **Data Volume**: If the datatable is large, this could pose performance issues depending on the method used to parse and analyze the data.\n\n5. **Location Identification**: The location might be represented in various ways (e.g., \"New York\", \"NY\", \"N.Y.\"), necessitating a robust method to identify all entries that pertain to New York.\n\n6. **Data Accuracy**: Incorrect data entries could lead to an inaccurate count (e.g., typos in height or location).\n\n7. **Complex Data Structure**: The datatable may have a complex structure that requires advanced parsing techniques to accurately extract the necessary information.\n\n8. **Filtering Challenges**: Multiple conditions need to be met (working in NY and being taller than 155). It's important to apply both filters correctly to arrive at the accurate count.\n\n9. **Data Integrity**: The assumption that rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person implies the need for integrity checks to ensure this rule is upheld throughout the data.\n\n10. **Conversion Requirements**: If height is not provided in centimeters, there may be a need to convert it to ensure consistency when assessing the \"taller than 155\" condition.\n\n11. **Data Ambiguity**: Ambiguities in data interpretation, such as whether \"taller than 155\" includes 155 or starts from 156, need to be clarified.\n\nAddressing these potential difficulties effectively will be crucial for accurate data analysis and proper extraction of insights."
