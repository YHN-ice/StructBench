However, several difficulties and obstacles might arise in the process:\n\n1. Data Inconsistencies: The data for the same person (with the same primeKey) might be split across different rows and may have inconsistencies or discrepancies that need to be resolved.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some rows might have missing information, such as unspecified work locations or heights, which would require additional rules for handling such cases.\n\n3. Data Format: Heights might be provided in different units or formats (e.g., meters, feet, inches), necessitating conversion to a consistent measurement (in this case, centimeters) to perform accurate comparisons.\n\n4. Multiple Entries: There could be multiple entries for the same person with different heights or locations, which would require deduplication based on the primeKey and a method for deciding which entry to consider.\n\n5. Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, efficient parsing and filtering techniques will be necessary to process the data within a reasonable time frame.\n\n6. Interpretation of \"Taller Than\": We need to establish whether \"taller than 179\" should include individuals who are exactly 179 cm tall or only those who exceed this height.\n\n7. Case Sensitivity: The location 'HI' needs to be matched case-insensitively unless it's guaranteed that the data is perfectly normalized in terms of case.\n\n8. Data Parsing Errors: Potential errors in parsing the datatable due to malformed data, unexpected special characters, or encoding issues that could corrupt the required information.\n\nOnce we define strategies to handle each of these potential difficulties, we can parse the datatable accurately and provide the correct answer to the question."
