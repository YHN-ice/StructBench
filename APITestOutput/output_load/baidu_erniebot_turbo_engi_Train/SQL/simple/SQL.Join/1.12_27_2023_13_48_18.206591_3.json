Missing Data: Some records might have missing height or state information, which would require a decision on how to handle such cases (e.g., exclude from the analysis, estimate values, etc.).\n\n4. Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, it may be necessary to use efficient parsing and searching algorithms to quickly find the relevant information.\n\n5. Data Parsing: Depending on the structure of the datatable (CSV, JSON, SQL database, etc.), a specific parsing approach will be needed to extract and filter the relevant data.\n\n6. Data Validation: Ensuring that the height values are numerical and that the state values match 'GA' exactly would be necessary to avoid errors in the analysis.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, it's important to carefully review the input file and apply appropriate data parsing and filtering techniques to accurately answer the question.
