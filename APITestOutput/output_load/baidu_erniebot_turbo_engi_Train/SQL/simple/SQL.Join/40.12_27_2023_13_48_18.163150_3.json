Ensuring that each person is only counted once will be important.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Data Formats**: Heights and work locations could be provided in different formats or with typographical errors, making it difficult to filter and compare them accurately.\n\n3. **Missing Data**: Some rows may have missing information on height, work location, or both. Deciding how to handle incomplete records will be crucial.\n\n4. **Data Accuracy**: The data may contain inaccuracies or false entries that could skew the results if not identified and corrected.\n\n5. **Units of Measurement**: Heights could be provided in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches), requiring conversions to a standard unit for comparison.\n\n6. **Filtering Complexity**: The criteria involve both location (working in NY) and a physical attribute (taller than 154).
