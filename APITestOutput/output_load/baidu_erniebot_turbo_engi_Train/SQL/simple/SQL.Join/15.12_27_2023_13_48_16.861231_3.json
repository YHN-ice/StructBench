Inconsistent Data Formatting: If the datatable has inconsistent formatting, such as different units of measurement (e.g., centimeters vs. inches for height), it could complicate the process of filtering by height.\n\n2. Missing Values: Some rows might have missing information for the height or the working location, which would require special handling to ensure accurate counting.\n\n3. Duplicates: The datatable could contain duplicate entries for the same person, identified by the primeKey. We would need to make sure each person is only counted once.\n\n4. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, relevant data such as height and work location could be spread across different rows. We'll need to aggregate this information before filtering.\n\n5. Complex Data Structure: If the datatable structure is complex, such as having nested tables or multiple tables that need to be joined, it could complicate the extraction and comparison process.\n\n6. Data Errors: The input file might contain errors or outliers (e.g., unrealistic heights) that would need to be identified and handled appropriately.\n\n7. Interpretation of \"taller than 155\": Depending on the context, this could mean strictly greater than 155 or greater than or equal to 156.\n\nThese are some of the challenges one might encounter when parsing datatables to retrieve specific information.

Aggregate the height information for each person by calculating the total height for all rows with that person's primeKey.\n4. Filter the aggregated height values to find those who are taller than 155.\n\nThe answer to your question would be the number of people who meet these criteria.
