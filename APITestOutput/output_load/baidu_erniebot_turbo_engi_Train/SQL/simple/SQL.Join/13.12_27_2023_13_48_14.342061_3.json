Data formatting and consistency:\n   The data may not be consistently formatted, especially regarding the height and state columns. We would need to standardize these to ensure proper comparison.\n\n3. Missing or incomplete data:\n   Some entries may have missing or incomplete information for height or work location, which would make it difficult to determine whether they meet the criteria.\n\n4.

Data parsing:\n   Depending on how the data is structured, it might require complex parsing to extract the relevant information.\n\n6. Handling of height units:\n   If height is provided in different units (e.g., feet/inches vs centimeters), we need to ensure that all heights are compared using the same unit of measurement.\n\n7. Efficient counting:\n   We must implement an efficient method to count the number of people who satisfy the criteria without redundantly processing the same individual multiple times.\n\nBy addressing these potential difficulties, we can ensure that the process of filtering and counting the individuals is accurate and efficient."
