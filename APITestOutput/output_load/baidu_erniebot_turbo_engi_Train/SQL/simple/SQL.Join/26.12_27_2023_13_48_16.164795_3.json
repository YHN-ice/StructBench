Any inconsistencies or errors in the height or state data could affect the accuracy of the answer.\n\n2. **Data Consistency**: If the dataset is updated or maintained by different individuals, there might be inconsistencies such as different units of measurement for height (centimeters vs. inches) or different abbreviations for states (IL vs. Ill.).\n\n3. **Data Format**: The format of the dataset can affect how easily the information can be parsed. For instance, if the height is recorded in a format that includes text (e.g., \"171 cm\"), extracting the numerical value could be more challenging.\n\n4. **Missing Data**: If there are missing values in either the 'state' or 'height' columns for some individuals, it could be difficult to determine whether they meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Duplicates and PrimeKey Association**: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, it is necessary to ensure that each person is only counted once, even if their information is spread across multiple rows.\n\n6. **Data Volume**: If the datatable is very large, it could pose challenges in terms of computational time and resources required to process the data.\n\n7. **Data Parsing Logic**: The logic used to parse the datatable needs to be robust enough to handle various edge cases, such as heights exactly equal to 171 (since the question specifically asks for taller than 171).\n\n8. **Filtering and Aggregation**: The process will involve filtering the data based on state (IL) and height (greater than 171), and then aggregating the results to count the number of individuals who meet both criteria.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it will be important to carefully validate and pre-process the data, use consistent parsing logic, and ensure that the counting mechanism accounts for unique individuals based on the primeKey."
