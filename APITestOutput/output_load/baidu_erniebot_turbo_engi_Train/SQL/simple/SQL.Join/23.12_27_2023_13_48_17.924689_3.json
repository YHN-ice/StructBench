Any incorrect data can lead to an incorrect count.\n\n6. **Ambiguous Location Identifiers**: The abbreviation \"GA\" must be clearly defined as a work location. If there are multiple meanings for GA, it could complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. **Non-standard Units of Measurement**: If height is not recorded in a standard unit (e.g., inches, centimeters), converting to a consistent measurement to assess who is taller than 180 could pose a challenge.\n\n8. **Complex Data Structures**: If the datatable contains complex or nested structures, extracting the necessary information might require more advanced parsing techniques.\n\n9. **Data Volume**: A large volume of data could slow down the parsing process, especially if manual checking or complex queries are required.\n\n10. **Textual Descriptions**: Sometimes, data can be presented with textual descriptions instead of numerical values (e.g., \"tall\" instead of an exact height measurement), which would need interpretation before analysis.\n\n11. **Ambiguities in Expression of Height**: If height is expressed in feet and inches (e.g., 5'11\") instead of a single unit like centimeters, additional parsing will be required.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file or data table structure, I can proceed to answer the question while keeping these potential challenges in mind."
