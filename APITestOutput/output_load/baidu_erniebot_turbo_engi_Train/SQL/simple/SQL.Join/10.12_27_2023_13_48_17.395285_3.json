Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If the data for a single person is spread across multiple rows, you must ensure to correctly associate the location with the height for each individual.\n\n3. Incomplete or Missing Data: Some rows may have missing information for height or work location, which would require a decision on how to handle such entries.\n\n4. Duplicate Entries: The same person could be listed more than once in the table, so it's necessary to identify and count each individual only once.\n\n5. Ambiguous Location Identifiers: If the location is not standardized and includes various abbreviations or misspellings for Illinois, it will be necessary to identify all variations that pertain to IL.\n\n6. Data Errors: There might be errors or outliers in the data that are not realistic (e.g., extremely high or low values for height) which would need to be accounted for or verified.\n\nUnderstanding these potential challenges will help in preparing to parse the data with accuracy and provide a correct answer.
