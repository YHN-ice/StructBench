Multiple Entries per Person: The same person might have multiple entries across the datatable. We need to ensure we are not counting a person more than once even if they appear multiple times in the table.\n\n3. Data Format: The data might not be in a standard format, which could require additional preprocessing steps to correctly identify and compare the height values.\n\n4. Missing Values: If some rows are missing the state code (IL) or the height information, we need to decide how to handle such incomplete data.\n\n5. Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, it might present performance issues while filtering through the data to identify people who work in Illinois (IL) and are taller than 153.\n\n6. Ambiguity in \"Taller than\": We need to clarify whether \"taller than 153\" includes people who are exactly 153 cm tall or only those who are taller than 153 cm.\n\n7.
