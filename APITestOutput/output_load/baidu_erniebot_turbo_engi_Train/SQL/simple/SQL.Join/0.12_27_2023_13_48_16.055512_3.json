Missing values in either of these fields could complicate the parsing process.\n\n3. **Multiple Entries**: Since the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there could be multiple entries for individuals. We'll need to ensure that we don't count the same person more than once.\n\n4. **Height Units**: If the height is not recorded in centimeters, we may need to perform unit conversions to compare against the 176 cm threshold.\n\n5. **Data Parsing Errors**: Incorrectly formatted data, human input errors, or inconsistencies in recording data could lead to parsing errors which may require additional validation and cleaning steps.\n\n6. **Case Sensitivity and Typos**: The location “NY” should be correctly identified despite potential case sensitivity issues or typos in the data.\n\n7. **Data Volume**: If the dataset is particularly large, it may pose performance issues and require more efficient parsing techniques or tools.\n\n8. **Data Privacy and Security**: Depending on the nature of the dataset, there might be restrictions on how the data can be used or shared, especially since it pertains to individuals' personal information.\n\nOnce I see the input file, I'll be able to address these issues specifically and parse the data accordingly to provide an accurate answer to your question."
