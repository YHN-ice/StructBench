If data is spread across multiple tables with a relational structure through primary keys, you need to correctly join tables on these keys.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Data**: There might be inconsistencies or errors in the data such as different units of measurement for height (e.g., feet instead of centimeters), typos, or missing values that could affect the accuracy of the results.\n\n3. **Multiple Entries**: If the datatable contains multiple entries for individuals (rows with the same primary key), ensuring that each individual is only counted once is crucial.\n\n4. **Filtering Data**: Properly filtering the datatable to include only those who work in IL and are taller than 176cm, while excluding all others.\n\n5. **Data Types**: Ensuring that the data types are correct for comparison, such as strings for text data and integers or floats for numerical data, like height.\n\n6. **Performance**: If the datatable is very large, querying it efficiently to avoid long processing times might be a challenge.\n\n7. **Missing/Null Values**: Handling null or missing values appropriately, deciding whether to exclude those records from the analysis or handle them in some other way.\n\n8. **Ambiguities**: Any ambiguities in the definition of \"work in IL\" (e.g., based at a company in IL, physically working in IL, etc.) and \"taller than 176\" (e.g., exactly 176cm included or not) need to be clarified for accurate results.\n\nOnce these potential issues are considered and addressed, parsing the datatable and extracting the required information can be done more accurately.
