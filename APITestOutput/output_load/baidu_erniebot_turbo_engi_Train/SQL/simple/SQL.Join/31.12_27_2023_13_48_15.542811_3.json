This requires careful aggregation of data based on the `primeKey` to ensure accurate information for each individual.\n\n3. **Handling Different Data Types**: The height information may be stored as a string instead of a number, requiring type conversion before comparison.\n\n4. **Inaccurate Data**: There could be inaccuracies or outliers in the height data that need to be accounted for or cleaned up.\n\n5. **Filtering by Multiple Criteria**: The requirement to select only those individuals who work in 'IL' and are taller than 151 cm means that the parsing logic must handle multiple filtering criteria.\n\n6. **Large Dataset**: If the dataset is large, it could pose performance issues and require efficient parsing and filtering methods.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Location Data**: 'IL' could potentially refer to different locations (e.g., Illinois or Israel), so context is important for ensuring accuracy.\n\n8. **Null or Missing Values**: There may be null or missing values for either the location or the height, which would require handling to prevent errors in the analysis.\n\n9. **Duplicate Records**: The dataset could contain duplicate records for individuals which would need to be identified and removed or aggregated correctly.\n\n10. **Data Privacy and Anonymization**: Depending on the nature of the data, there might be privacy concerns that limit the amount of information available for parsing.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we would need to carefully inspect the data, clean and preprocess it as necessary, use appropriate filtering and aggregation methods, and apply any necessary type conversions or unit standardizations."
