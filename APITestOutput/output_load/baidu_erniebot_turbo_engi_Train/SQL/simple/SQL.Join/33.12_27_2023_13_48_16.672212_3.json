In such a case, the primeKey would be crucial to match records accurately.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Data Formats**: The height might be recorded in different units (centimeters vs. inches) or formats, requiring conversion or standardization before comparison.\n\n3. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Some records might have missing information regarding height or the location of the workplace. Such records will need special consideration—either by excluding them from the count or by making assumptions based on available data.\n\n4. **Data Entry Errors**: Typos or incorrect entries can lead to inaccurate counts. For example, 'CA' could be mistakenly entered as 'AC' or 'C.A.', and heights could be recorded with errors.\n\n5. **Case Sensitivity and Whitespace**: When filtering for people who work in CA, the parser must be case-insensitive and trim any leading or trailing whitespace to ensure accurate filtering.\n\n6. **Non-Standard Representations of Locations**: Work locations could be represented by full state names ('California') instead of abbreviations ('CA'), requiring additional logic to interpret these correctly.\n\n7. **Large Data Volume**: If the datatable is very large, performance considerations may come into play, necessitating efficient parsing and querying techniques.\n\nOnce I have the input file, I'll need to parse the data while keeping these potential issues in mind to provide an accurate count of people working in CA who are taller than 179."

        "The question asks how many people who work in CA are taller than 179. To answer this question, you need to look at the \"company\" column in the \"company\" table and filter for CA.

This requires conversion or standardization before comparison.\n3. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Some records may have missing height or workplace information. This will require special consideration - either excluding them from the count or making assumptions based on available data.\n4. **Data Entry Errors**: Typos or incorrect entries can lead to inaccurate counts.
