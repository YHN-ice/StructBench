        "To determine how many people who work in New York (NY) are taller than 158 cm, you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the correct location: The question mentions \"NY\" as the location, but it could be an abbreviation or a specific place within New York. Therefore, you need to confirm that the location field is indeed \"NY\" and not a different abbreviation or place within New York.\n2. Filter for height: You can use the height field to filter for people who are taller than 158 cm.\n3. Remove duplicates: If the same person has multiple entries in the dataset, you need to remove them to avoid counting them more than once.\n4. Combine rows with the same prime key: If a person’s information is spread across multiple rows with the same prime key, you need to correctly associate and combine information from these rows.\n5. Handle inaccurate or missing data: It is important to verify the accuracy of height data and deal with any missing or inaccurate information.\n\nAfter performing these steps, you can easily count the number of people who meet the specified height requirement and work in New York.\n\nAnswer: Based on the provided data, there are 3 people who work in New York and are taller than 158 cm. They are:\n\na) 181 cm (male)\nc) 197 cm (male)\ne) 176 cm (male)\n\nNote: This answer assumes that the height data is accurate and does not contain any typos or missing information. If there are any inconsistencies or inaccuracies, the actual number of tall people working in New York could be different."
