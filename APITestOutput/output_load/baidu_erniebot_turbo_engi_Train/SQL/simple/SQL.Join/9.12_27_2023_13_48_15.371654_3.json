Data Parsing: Depending on the format of the data tables, parsing the data correctly to extract relevant information about the people who work in IL and their heights could be challenging.\n\n2. Multiple Entries: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, there may be multiple rows for a single individual. Ensuring that each person is counted only once could be an obstacle.\n\n3. Data Consistency: Heights might be recorded in different units or formats (e.g., centimeters, meters, feet, and inches), necessitating conversion to a consistent unit of measurement for accurate comparison.\n\n4. Missing or Incomplete Data: If any rows are missing information for the location or height, it might be difficult to determine if they meet the criteria.\n\n5. Error Handling: The data might contain errors, such as non-numeric values for height or incorrect state abbreviations, which would need to be handled appropriately.\n\n6. Performance Issues: If the dataset is very large, there might be performance considerations to account for in order to process the data efficiently.\n\n7. Logical Implementation: Proper logic needs to be implemented to filter out people who work in IL (Illinois) and then compare their height against the specified threshold of 176 units.\n\nOnce I have access to the input file data structure, I can provide a more accurate response to the question."
