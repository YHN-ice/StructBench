        "The primeKey you're asking about is \"primeKey\" in the first table and \"primeKey\" in the second table. Based on the provided information, here's how you can locate the record with primeKey \"e\":\n\n1. Read the input file and parse it into a data structure that can be easily searched. You can use a dictionary or a list of dictionaries to store the data, where each entry represents a row in the table.\n2. Search for the primeKey \"e\" in the data structure. If you find it, you can then access the corresponding columns (e.g., name, age, etc.) to find out more information about the record.\n3. To address potential difficulties and obstacles like incomplete or corrupted data, large dataset, ambiguous reference, complex data structure, formatting consistency, and file accessibility, you can follow these guidelines:\n\n\n\t* Validate the input file before parsing to ensure it's properly formatted and contains the correct data.\n\t* Use appropriate tools and methods to parse large datasets efficiently and accurately.\n\t* Avoid ambiguity by ensuring that the primeKey \"e\" is unique within the dataset.\n\t* Navigate through nested tables or join information from different tables based on the primeKey only when necessary.\n\t* Follow consistent formatting guidelines to avoid parsing errors.\n\t* Ensure that the file containing the datatable is accessible and can be read by your application or parsing tool.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to locate the record with primeKey \"e\" efficiently and accurately.
