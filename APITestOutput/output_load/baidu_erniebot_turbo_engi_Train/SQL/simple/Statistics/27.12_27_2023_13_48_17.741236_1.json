If they're stored as strings, they would need to be converted to numerical data types first.\n\n3. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: If the dataset is missing salary information for some individuals, it may lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n4. **Duplicates or Errors**: There might be duplicate entries or errors in the data that could misrepresent the number of individuals with salaries over the specified amount.\n\n5. **Multiple Currencies**: If the dataset includes international salaries, different currencies could be involved, and comparing them directly without considering exchange rates would be misleading.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structures**: If salaries are not in a simple flat table but spread across related tables (which may need to be joined on a prime key), extracting the necessary information will require more complex queries.\n\n7. **Large Data Volume**: If the dataset is very large, performance issues could arise, necessitating efficient querying and parsing strategies.\n\n8. **Ambiguities in the Definition of Salary**: The dataset might include base salary, bonuses, and other compensations separately. Clarification may be needed on whether to consider total compensation or just base salary.\n\nOnce I've received the input file or data structure, I'll proceed with parsing the datatable to answer the question, keeping in mind these potential obstacles."
