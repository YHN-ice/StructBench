Data Format: The format of the data table needs to be consistent and well-defined in order to parse it correctly. If there are formatting issues, it could lead to misinterpretation of the data.\n\n2. Data Consistency: If there are inconsistencies in the way salary data is presented (e.g., different currency symbols, use of commas or periods for thousands and decimals), it might require additional processing to standardize the values before comparison.\n\n3. Large Data Set: If the data table is very large, it may pose computational challenges or longer processing times.\n\n4. Data Accuracy: The data needs to be accurate and up-to-date. Any errors in the salary information could lead to an incorrect count.\n\n5. Duplicate Records: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, it is important to ensure that each person is only counted once, even if they appear in multiple rows.\n\n6. Correct Interpretation of PrimeKey: Properly understanding and using the primeKey is critical to ensure duplicates are not counted.\n\n7. Numeric Values: Salary data must be correctly recognized as numeric values to allow for numerical comparisons.\n\n8. Missing or Null Values: Handling missing or null values for salaries must be done carefully to avoid skewing the results.\n\n9. Complex Queries: The process might require complex querying or filtering if there are additional conditions or complex structures within the datatable.\n\nOnce these potential difficulties are addressed, I'll be able to parse the datatable provided and accurately respond to your query regarding the number of people with a salary above 110189."
