Data Format: The format of the data might not be standardized, which could make parsing the table more challenging. For example, if salaries are formatted inconsistently, it could be hard to identify and compare them.\n\n2. Multiple Entries: If the datatable includes multiple entries for the same person (identified by the same primeKey), it's important not to count a person more than once.\n\n3. Missing or Incomplete Data: If some rows are missing salary data or contain errors, it might be difficult to determine whether those individuals should be counted.\n\n4. Large Data Set: If the datatable is very large, it might take considerable computational time to parse through all entries and perform the necessary calculations.\n\n5. Data Types: Ensuring that the salary data is interpreted as numeric values rather than strings is important for accurate comparisons.\n\n6. Decimal Separator: The use of different decimal separators (such as periods or commas) could affect the interpretation of salary figures.\n\n7. Salary Updates: If there are updates to salaries in the table (represented by newer entries with the same primeKey), it's important to use only the most recent salary information for each person.\n\nUntil I see the input file, these are hypothetical challenges. Once provided with the file, I will be able to more accurately pinpoint the specific difficulties involved in answering the question."
