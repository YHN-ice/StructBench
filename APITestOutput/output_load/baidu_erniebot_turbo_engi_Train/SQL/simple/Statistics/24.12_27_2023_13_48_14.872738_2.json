Missing Data: Some rows might have missing or incomplete gender data, which could lead to an undercount.\n\n3. Duplication: Since the same primeKey indicates the same person, care must be taken to not double-count individuals across multiple rows.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: Some datasets may use non-standard indicators for gender or include additional genders beyond just male or female, making it more challenging to filter for just females.\n\n5. Data Size and Accessibility: If the dataset is very large or in a format that is difficult to parse, this could complicate the process of counting.\n\n6. Interpretation Errors: There might be typographical errors or inconsistencies in entering gender information that could lead to incorrect classification unless carefully checked.\n\n7. Case Sensitivity: The parsing logic must account for case sensitivity if the dataset is not uniform in case usage for gender identification.\n\n8. Multiple or Mixed Datasets: If the data table comprises multiple datasets with different columns or formatting, it could complicate the process of identifying and counting females.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, an effective parsing strategy should include normalization of gender indicators, deduplication based on primeKeys, handling missing values properly, and ensuring that the parsing logic is robust against variations in data presentation."
