When parsing data tables with the goal of counting the number of people with a salary above a certain threshold, several potential difficulties and obstacles might include:\n\n1. Data Format Consistency: The data might not be consistently formatted, which could lead to difficulties in identifying and comparing salary figures correctly.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some entries might have missing or incomplete salary information, making it unclear whether these individuals meet the salary criteria.\n\n3. Data Types: Salaries might be represented as strings with currency symbols or commas, requiring conversion to numerical values for comparison.\n\n4. Multiple Entries: If the table has multiple entries for the same person (with the same primeKey) but different salary information, it would be necessary to determine which salary to consider.\n\n5. Large Data Volume: If the dataset is exceptionally large, performance considerations may come into play when processing the data to count qualifying individuals.\n\n6. Incorrect Data: There may be errors in the data (e.g., typos in salary figures) that could affect the accuracy of the count.\n\n7. Sorting and Filtering: The data may need to be sorted or filtered to isolate the relevant entries, which could be complicated if the sorting or filtering criteria are not straightforward.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, you would typically employ careful data validation and cleaning, ensure proper type conversion for numerical comparisons, handle duplicates appropriately, and possibly use optimized algorithms or tools for large datasets.
