The values mentioned for salary are greater than 341,731 and hence the count would be 4. However, there are two records with retired status which could potentially skew the result, so I will remove them from the count and arrive at the final count of 3.\n\nIn order to handle the issues raised in the above paragraph (especially regarding salary representation and parsing logic), you could follow these steps:\n\n1. Normalize the salary information by converting it to a common format (like annual salary).\n2. Implement a robust parsing logic that can handle various edge cases.\n3. Efficiently handle large datasets using appropriate data structures and algorithms.\n\nIn addition, you must ensure that any processing of sensitive information follows appropriate privacy and security measures.
