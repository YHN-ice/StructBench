Missing or incomplete data: If some rows are missing gender information or the datatable is incomplete, it would be hard to determine the gender for those entries.\n\n4. Merged cells or split rows: If rows are split across multiple lines or if cells are merged, parsing the table correctly to identify unique individuals and their genders could be problematic.\n\n5. Ambiguous identifiers: If the datatable uses ambiguous pronouns or titles without clear gender indications, it might be challenging to determine the gender.\n\n6. Multiple entries for the same person: If there are multiple rows with the same primeKey that contain conflicting gender information, it could complicate the process of determining how many people are female.\n\n7.
