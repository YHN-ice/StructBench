        "In this problem, you will need to scan through the given data table and count the number of people who earn more than $246,137.\n\nTo do this, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Normalize the salary data: Make sure that all salary data is represented in the same format and currency. If necessary, convert currencies to a common one (e.g., USD).\n2. Count unique individuals: Since individuals may be listed multiple times with the same primeKey, you will need to count each person only once.\n3. Identify and handle missing or incomplete data: If there are rows with missing salary information or incomplete records, you will need to either ignore them or handle them appropriately (e.g., set a default salary or use some other method to estimate the salary).\n4. Use efficient algorithms: If the data table is very large, it may pose a challenge for performance and memory usage. You will need to use efficient parsing and searching algorithms to scan through the data efficiently.\n\nAfter identifying these potential issues, you can proceed to count the number of people who earn more than $246,137. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Parse the data table and identify the relevant columns: Look for the columns with salary information (salary and company) and determine the minimum salary threshold.\n2. Iterate through the rows and count: For each row, check if the salary is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it is, increment a counter to keep track of the number of people who earn more than $246,137.\n\nTo assist you with this process, I've included a Python code snippet below:\n\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Normalize salary data\nsalary_data = [...]  # Your normalized salary data here\n\n# Step 2: Count unique individuals\nunique_persons = set()  # Initialize a set to keep track of unique individuals\n\n# Step 3: Iterate through rows and count\nfor row in salary_data:\n    person_key = row['primeKey']  # Assuming 'primeKey' is your unique identifier column\n    salary = float(row['salary'])  # Convert salary to float for comparison\n    if salary >= 246137:  # Check if salary is greater than or equal to threshold\n        unique_persons.add(person_key)  # If so, add person_key to unique_persons set\n\n# Step 4: Print result\nprint(\"Number of people who earn more than $246,137:\", len(unique_persons))\n```\nMake sure to replace `[...]` with your actual normalized salary data and adjust the code as needed based on your specific data table structure and column names. This code assumes that your unique identifier column is named 'primeKey' and that 'salary' column contains the salary information."
