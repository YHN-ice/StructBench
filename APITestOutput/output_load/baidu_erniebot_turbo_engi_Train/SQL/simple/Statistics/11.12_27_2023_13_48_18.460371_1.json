Data Format and Structure: The format of the input file might present challenges. For instance, if the salary data is not organized in a straightforward manner or is inconsistent, extracting the relevant information may be more complex.\n\n2. Data Consistency: If there are inconsistencies in how salary data is stored (for example, mixing different currencies or including non-numeric characters), it could make it more difficult to compare salary values directly.\n\n3. Large Data Volume: If the datatable is very large, it may take a considerable amount of time to process and filter through all the records to find those with salaries above the specified amount.\n\n4. Duplicate Records: If the datatable contains duplicate records (rows with the same primeKey), care must be taken not to count the same person more than once when computing the total number of people.\n\n5. Data Parsing Errors: Errors may occur in parsing data if the format is not as expected—for example, if salary figures are not in a numerical column or if there are formatting issues such as commas in numbers.\n\n6. Missing Data: Some records may have missing or null salary fields. These records would need to be handled appropriately to avoid skewing the results.\n\n7. Complex Queries: Depending on how the datatable is structured, it might require complex queries or calculations to extract and compare salary information.\n\nOnce we have the input file, we will need to review it carefully to address these potential issues and accurately determine the number of people with salaries greater than 890419."
