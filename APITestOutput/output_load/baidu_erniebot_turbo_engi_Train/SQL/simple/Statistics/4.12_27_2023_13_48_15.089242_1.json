        "As an artificial intelligence language model, I am unable to access your specific dataset. However, based on the information you provided, there are a few ways you can calculate the number of people with a salary greater than 135,277.\n\nFirstly, you can use a script or program to parse the input file and extract the salary information from the table. Ensure that you follow the format of the table correctly and extract the relevant salary information.\n\nSecondly, you can perform a numerical comparison of the salary data with the threshold of 135,277 and count the number of matching rows.\n\nThirdly, if the dataset is large, you may consider using a database management system like MySQL or PostgreSQL to handle the data efficiently. These systems provide built-in functions for data manipulation and querying, making it easier to perform complex calculations and analysis.\n\nFinally, if you encounter any issues or difficulties during the process, it is recommended that you consult with a professional in the field of data analysis or statistical inference for assistance.\n\nGood luck with your project!"
