Inconsistent Data: There might be inconsistencies or errors in the data that need to be addressed, such as non-numeric characters in the salary field or incorrect entries.\n\n5. Sorting and Filtering: Depending on the structure of the datatable, it might be necessary to sort or filter the data to efficiently count the number of people with the desired salary.\n\n6. Data Accessibility: The data might be in a format or medium that is not easily accessible or readable, requiring conversion or special software to parse.\n\n7.
