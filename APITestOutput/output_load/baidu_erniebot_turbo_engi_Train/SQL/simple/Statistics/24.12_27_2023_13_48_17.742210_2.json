Duplicate Entries: There might be duplicate entries for the same person with the same primeKey. Care must be taken to count each person only once.\n\n3. Data Format: The data could be in a format that is difficult to parse, such as a PDF or an image file, rather than a structured format like CSV or JSON, which could complicate data extraction.\n\n4.

Ambiguous Identifiers: If the gender identifier is not clear or is ambiguous, it may be difficult to accurately categorize entries.\n\n6.
