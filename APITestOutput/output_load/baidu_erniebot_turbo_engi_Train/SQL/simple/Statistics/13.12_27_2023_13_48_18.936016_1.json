Parse the data table to extract only those records where the salary is greater than 862,405. You can use a WHERE clause in your SQL query or a filter function in your programming language to achieve this.\n2. After filtering, you will have a list of unique primeKeys for those people who earn a salary greater than 862,405.\n3. Count the number of unique primeKeys to get the total number of people who earn a salary greater than 862,405.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise during this process:\n\n1. **Data Formatting Issues:** Salary data might not be uniformly formatted, which could complicate the parsing process.\n2. **Data Inconsistencies:** If there are multiple entries for the same person, there may be inconsistencies in salary information that need to be resolved.\n3. **Data Volume:** If the data table contains a large number of records, it might take a significant amount of time to process, especially if the parsing is being done without the help of optimized tools or libraries.\n4. **Missing or Corrupted Data:** Some records may have missing or corrupted data, which could lead to inaccurate counts unless handled properly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, you should carefully validate, clean, and transform your data before performing any calculations and counting operations.
