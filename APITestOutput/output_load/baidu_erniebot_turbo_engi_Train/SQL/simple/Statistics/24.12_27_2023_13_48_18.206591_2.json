Missing or Null Values: If some rows are missing gender data, it will be important to decide how to handle these cases.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: The dataset might contain duplicate entries for the same person. Since the same person should only be counted once, it's necessary to account for this by using a unique identifier (primeKey).\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Identifiers: The dataset may include non-binary or other gender identifiers that don't fit into the traditional male/female categories.\n\n5. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If a single person's information is spread across multiple rows, care must be taken to ensure they are not counted more than once.\n\n6. Data Errors: There may be errors or typos in the dataset that could lead to miscounting if not properly addressed.\n\n7. Complex Data Structures: The dataset might have a complex structure or be in a format that requires specific parsing logic to extract the needed information.\n\n8.
