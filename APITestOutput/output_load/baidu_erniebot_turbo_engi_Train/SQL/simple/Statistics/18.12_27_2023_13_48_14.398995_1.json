Data Inconsistencies: If the data has inconsistencies such as formatting errors, missing values, or incorrect entries (such as a salary listed as a negative number), it could lead to inaccuracies in identifying the correct number of people with the specified salary range.\n\n2. Duplicate Entries: If the datatable contains duplicate rows for the same person (as indicated by a shared primeKey), we must ensure that each individual is only counted once to avoid inflating the numbers.\n\n3. Data Volume: If the datatable is extensive, manual counting would be time-consuming and prone to human error, necessitating an automated approach to efficiently parse the data.\n\n4. Complex Data Structures: Depending on how the data is structured in the datatable (e.g., multiple tables, nested information), extracting the relevant information (such as salary figures) might require complex parsing techniques.\n\n5. Data Accessibility: If the datatable is in a format that is not easily readable or accessible (e.g., a proprietary file format, password-protected), this could pose a challenge for extracting the necessary information.\n\n6.
