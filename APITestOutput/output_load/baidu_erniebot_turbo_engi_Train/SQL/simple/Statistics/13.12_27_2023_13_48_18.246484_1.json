In this case, we can simply replace them with a single space.\n\nSecondly, we need to check for duplicate entries, so we need to make sure not to count the same person more than once. To do this, we can remove the primeKey column from the input data, which will make it much easier to count the same person only once.\n\nThirdly, we need to make sure that the data is complete and has no missing values. If there are missing values in the salary column, we need to fill them with some default value or exclude those rows from the count.\n\nFourthly, we need to convert the salary data to numerical values if they are stored as strings.\n\nFinally, if the dataset is large, we need to use efficient parsing and counting methods to avoid performance issues.\n\nAfter addressing these challenges, we can easily count the number of people who earn more than salary 987225.\n\nBased on your input data, there are 6 people who earn more than salary 987225: a, e, f, g, h, i.
