Salaries could be written with different formats, such as including commas, decimal points, or currency symbols, which requires normalization before comparison.\n\n2. **Multiple Entries**: There might be multiple entries for the same person with the same or different salary information. It will be necessary to ensure that each person is counted only once, even if they appear multiple times with the same primeKey.\n\n3. **Data Size**: If the dataset is very large, it could pose performance issues and require efficient processing methods to filter out the relevant rows.\n\n4. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Some entries might lack salary information or have null values, which need to be handled correctly to avoid miscounting.\n\n5. **Data Types and Comparison**: The salary data must be interpreted as numeric values for comparison rather than as strings. This might require type casting or conversion.\n\n6. **Erroneous Data**: There might be errors in the data, such as salaries that are not plausible (too high or too low), which could affect the count if not identified and handled properly.\n\n7. **File Format and Reading**: The data might be in a file format that requires specific parsing techniques (e.g., CSV, JSON, Excel) to extract the necessary information.\n\nOnce we have access to the input file with the actual data, these potential issues will guide us in processing the data accurately to determine the number of people with salaries exceeding 945896."
