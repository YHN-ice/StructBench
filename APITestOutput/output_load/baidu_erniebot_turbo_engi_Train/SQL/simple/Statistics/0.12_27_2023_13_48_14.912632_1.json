        "The question is asking how many people have a salary greater than 890,775. To answer this question, we need to look at the salary column in the provided table and count the number of rows where the salary is greater than 890,775.\n\nTo do this, we can use a simple SQL query like this:\n\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name WHERE salary > 890775\n```\n\nThis query will return the number of rows in the table where the salary is greater than 890,775.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this assumes the salary data is formatted correctly and that there are no missing or incorrect data entries.
