This would require some form of conflict resolution or data cleaning.\n\n4. **Data Type Issues**: Salary data might be stored as strings or mixed with text, requiring conversion to a numeric type to perform comparisons.\n\n5. **Large Datasets**: If the datatable is particularly large, performance considerations may come into play. Efficient filtering and counting mechanisms will be necessary.\n\n6. **Incomplete Data**: Some rows could have missing salary information, which would need to be handled appropriately (e.g., skipping these records).\n\n7. **Incorrect Data**: There could be erroneous entries (e.g., negative salaries, outliers) that may not make sense in the context and need to be identified and possibly excluded from the analysis.\n\nOnce these potential difficulties are addressed, we will be able to parse the datatable accurately and answer the question at hand.
