If not, string comparison could lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Missing or Incorrect Data**: The presence of missing or incorrect salary data could lead to inaccurate counts. Handling such anomalies will be necessary to ensure an accurate count.\n\n6. **Data Spanning Across Multiple Rows or Columns**: If salary information is split across multiple rows or columns, it will require additional logic to aggregate this information before performing the count.\n\n7. **Data Security and Privacy**: Salary information is sensitive, so ensuring that any operations done respect privacy and security standards is important.\n\nBy anticipating these challenges, we can approach the parsing process more effectively, ensuring that we handle data correctly and provide an accurate answer to the query.
