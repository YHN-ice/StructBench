Identifying and correcting such errors might be necessary to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Large Data Volume**: If the datatable is very large, it may require efficient parsing methods to process the data quickly and accurately.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structures**: If the datatable includes nested structures or non-tabular data that need to be parsed to extract salary information, this could complicate the parsing process.\n\n7. **Sorting or Filtering Tools**: Depending on the tools available for parsing the datatable, it may be more or less challenging to sort or filter the data to identify the relevant records.\n\nOnce you provide the datatable, I'll be able to give a more precise answer and address any specific challenges presented by the data."
