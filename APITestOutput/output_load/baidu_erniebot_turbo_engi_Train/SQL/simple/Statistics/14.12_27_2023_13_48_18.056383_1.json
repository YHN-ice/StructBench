When parsing datatables to answer questions about the data, several difficulties and obstacles may arise, especially with the query regarding people with salaries greater than a certain amount. Here are some potential challenges:\n\n1. Inconsistent Data Formats: If the salary data is not consistently formatted (e.g., various currencies, use of commas or periods for thousands separators), it might require additional processing to standardize the values before comparison.\n\n2. Missing Data: There may be rows where the salary information is missing or recorded as null. These rows would need to be handled appropriately to avoid incorrect calculations.\n\n3. Erroneous Data: The dataset could contain incorrect or outlier salary data due to input errors, which could skew the results if not identified and handled.\n\n4. Large Datasets: If the datatable is very large, performance could become an issue, and efficient data processing techniques may be necessary.\n\n5. Multiple Entries per Person: If the datatable has more than one row per person (indicated by a primeKey), we need to ensure that we only count each person once.\n\n6. Data Types: Ensuring that the salary data is treated as a numerical value rather than a string during comparisons is essential, as string comparison logic differs from numerical comparisons.\n\n7. Data Privacy: Salaries are sensitive information, so there might be restrictions or privacy concerns when handling this data.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges will help in preparing to parse the datatable effectively and provide accurate answers to the question at hand. Please provide the datatable, and I will proceed with extracting the needed information while keeping these potential issues in mind."
