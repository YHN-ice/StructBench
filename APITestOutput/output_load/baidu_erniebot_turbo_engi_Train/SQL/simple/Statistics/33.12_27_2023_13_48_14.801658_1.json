However, several potential difficulties and obstacles could hinder this process:\n\n1. Data format: The datatable might be in a format that is not straightforward to parse, such as a PDF or an image of a table, which would require OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or manual conversion to a machine-readable format like CSV or JSON.\n\n2. Data size: If the datatable is very large, it could pose performance issues for the parser, requiring efficient algorithms and potentially more computational resources.\n\n3. Inconsistent data: The table might have inconsistencies such as missing values, typos, or different formats for the salary (e.g., with or without commas and currency symbols), which would need to be cleaned and standardized before analysis.\n\n4. Duplicate entries: As the rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we must ensure that we do not count a person more than once if their data is split across multiple rows.\n\n5. Complex data structures: The datatable might have nested structures or be spread across multiple tables, requiring a more complex parsing logic to correlate data correctly.\n\n6. Ambiguous data: There might be ambiguities in interpreting what constitutes a \"salary\" if there are multiple compensatory figures provided (e.g., base salary, bonuses, commissions).\n\n7. Data access: The datatable may be stored in a secure location or may require authentication to access, which could pose access challenges.\n\n8. Data privacy: If the datatable contains sensitive information, there may be legal or ethical considerations to take into account when accessing and parsing the data.\n\nOnce we have the datatable and know its format, we can develop a strategy to parse it while addressing these potential difficulties."
