If there are any typos or incorrect entries, it could lead to an incorrect count.\n\n4. **Duplicate Entries**: If the datatable includes duplicate entries for the same individual (indicated by the same primeKey), care must be taken not to count the same person's salary more than once.\n\n5. **Data Volume**: If the datatable is very large, it may be computationally intensive to parse through all the entries to find those with a salary above the specified threshold.\n\n6. **Complex Data Types**: If salaries are not stored as simple numeric values but as complex data types (such as strings with currency symbols), additional parsing might be required to extract the numeric values before comparison.\n\n7. **Correct Interpretation of \"More Than\"**: Ensuring that the comparison operator correctly excludes salaries that are exactly 154422 and only counts those that are higher.\n\n8. **Data Source Reliability**: If the source of the datatable is unknown or unreliable, it may require verification before proceeding with the analysis.\n\nThese are some of the challenges one might face.
