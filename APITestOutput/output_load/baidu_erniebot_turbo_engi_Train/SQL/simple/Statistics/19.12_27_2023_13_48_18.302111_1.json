Data Format Variations: The salary data could come in various formats such as strings with currency symbols or commas that need to be parsed into numerical values for comparison.\n\n2. Duplicate Records: Since rows with the same primeKey refer to the same person, we must ensure that each person is counted only once, even if their data appears multiple times.\n\n3. Incomplete or Inconsistent Data: Some records might have missing or inconsistent salary information, which could complicate the process of determining who meets the salary criteria.\n\n4. Large Datasets: If the dataset is particularly large, performance considerations might come into play, necessitating efficient algorithms to parse and analyze the data.\n\n5. Data Spread Over Multiple Rows: If a person's salary information is spread over multiple rows, we will need a method to aggregate this information correctly before performing the comparison.\n\n6. Incorrect Data Entry: There might be cases of incorrect data entries that could lead to false positives or negatives, such as a salary entered as \"25613700\" instead of \"256137\".\n\n7. Conversion of Data Types: It may be required to convert string representations of numbers into actual numerical data types to perform the comparison.\n\n8. Sorting or Filtering: Depending on the size and structure of the data table, it may be necessary to sort or filter the data to efficiently identify individuals with salaries above the threshold.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, careful parsing, validation, de-duplication, and aggregation of data will be required.

        "The question is asking how many people earn more than $256,137. To answer this question, we need to parse the data table and perform some operations to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\n1. Parse the data table: We need to parse the salary data to convert it into numerical values. This can be done by removing currency symbols, commas, or other non-numeric characters.\n\n2. Duplicate records: We need to ensure that each person is counted only once, even if their data appears multiple times. This can be done by using a unique identifier or primary key to identify each person.\n\n3. Incomplete or inconsistent data: Some records might have missing or inconsistent salary information, which could complicate the process of determining who meets the salary criteria. We need to handle these cases by either skipping or replacing the missing values with a default value or estimating them based on other available information.\n\n4. Sorting or filtering: If the dataset is particularly large, we may need to sort or filter the data to efficiently identify individuals with salaries above the threshold. This can be done by sorting the rows based on salary or applying filters based on salary criteria.\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that there are four people in the provided data table who earn more than $256,137: a, b, c, and d.
