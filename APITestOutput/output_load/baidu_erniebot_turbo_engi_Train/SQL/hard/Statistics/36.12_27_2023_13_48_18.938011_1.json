For example, salaries may not be standardized in terms of currency or may include commas, periods, or other characters that need to be accounted for.\n\n2. **Multiple Entries for a Person**: If the table uses a primeKey to identify people, it’s possible that a person could have multiple rows of data associated with them. We'll need to ensure that we only count each person once, even if their salary is listed multiple times.\n\n3. **Data Integrity**: There may be missing or incorrect data entries that could affect the accuracy of the results. Ensuring the integrity of the data before processing will be essential.\n\n4. **Comparing Numeric Values**: Salaries will need to be compared as numeric values to determine if they are greater than 919150. This means that any non-numeric data will need to be cleansed or converted into a numeric format for accurate comparison.\n\n5. **Large Data Sets**: If the datatable is very large, it might present performance issues. Efficient algorithms or data structures may be required to handle large volumes of data.\n\n6. **Handling of Different Currencies**: If the salaries are in different currencies, we will need to convert them into a single currency to make a fair comparison.\n\n7. **Correct Interpretation of Salary Figures**: Salaries could be represented in different ways (e.g., yearly, monthly, weekly) and would require normalization to a common time frame for proper comparison.\n\n8. **Data Privacy and Sensitivity**: Depending on the context, salary information can be sensitive. Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure the privacy and security of the data.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, careful planning and execution will be necessary, including potentially writing custom parsing logic, using data validation and cleansing techniques, and ensuring sensitive data is handled responsibly."
