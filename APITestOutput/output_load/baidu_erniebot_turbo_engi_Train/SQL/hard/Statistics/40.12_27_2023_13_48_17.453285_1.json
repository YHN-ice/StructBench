If the format varies (e.g., different currencies, presence of commas or other characters), it may need to be cleaned or standardized.\n\n2. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: If the dataset is incomplete or has missing salary values, it may be challenging to determine the exact number of people earning more than the specified amount.\n\n3. **Duplicate Records**: There may be duplicate records for individuals (rows with the same primeKey). Identifying and aggregating data for unique individuals will be necessary to avoid overcounting.\n\n4. **Data Volume**: A large dataset might pose performance issues, depending on the tool used for parsing and analyzing the data.\n\n5. **Sorting and Filtering**: Efficiently sorting and filtering the dataset to identify salaries above a certain threshold will be necessary. The tool or method used must be capable of handling these operations effectively.\n\n6. **Data Type Issues**: Ensuring that the salary field is treated as a numeric type rather than a string or other data type so that mathematical comparisons can be made accurately.\n\n7. **Data Access and Permissions**: Depending on the source of the datatable, there might be restrictions or limitations on accessing or manipulating the data.\n\nUnderstanding the structure of the input file and any associated metadata is crucial to accurately parsing and analyzing it to determine the number of people earning more than 597205.
