        "The table you provided has seven rows of information about individuals, and each row contains columns of primary key (primeKey), gender, age, name, height, weight, color, status, salary, company, and location. Based on the question you provided, you want to know how many people are female.\n\nTo answer this question, you can simply count the number of rows where the gender column has \"female\" or \"female\" as the value. Since you provided the table in a CSV format, you can use a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets to perform this counting.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Excel:\n\n1. Open Excel and import the table into a worksheet.\n2. Select the gender column and filter it to show only \"female\" or \"female\".\n3. Count the number of rows that are selected. This will give you the number of female people.\n\nIf you prefer to do it manually without using Excel or Google Sheets, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Count the number of rows where the gender column has \"female\" or \"female\" as the value.\n2. Subtract the number of rows where gender is not specified or unknown (i.e., missing data).\n\nThis will give you the final count of female people in the table.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need help with counting female people in the table, feel free to ask!"
