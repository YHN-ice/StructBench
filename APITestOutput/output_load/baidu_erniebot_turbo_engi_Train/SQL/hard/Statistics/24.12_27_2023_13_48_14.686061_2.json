Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If the same person's information is spread across multiple rows identified by a primeKey, there might be challenges ensuring that each person is only counted once.\n\n3. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some entries may have missing gender data, which means that assumptions might have to be made based on available information, potentially leading to inaccuracies.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Representation: The data table might include non-binary or transgender individuals whose gender may not be clearly categorized as female without additional context.\n\n5. Large Data Sets: If the data set is particularly large, performance issues might arise in processing and accurately counting the number of females.\n\n6. Data Format: Depending on how the data is formatted (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML), different parsing techniques will be required, which could complicate the process.\n\n7.
