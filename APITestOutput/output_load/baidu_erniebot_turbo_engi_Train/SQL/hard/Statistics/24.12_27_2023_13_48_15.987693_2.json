        "The question asks for the number of females in the dataset. It appears that there are seven female entries in the input dataset, including one who is retired and two who are unemployed. There are also three male entries in the dataset, as well as one person with multiple rows, but the data suggests that only one person is being counted multiple times. Therefore, there are a total of 12 records (including one multiple-person record) with a gender value, of which 7 are female. Therefore, the answer is \"7\"."
