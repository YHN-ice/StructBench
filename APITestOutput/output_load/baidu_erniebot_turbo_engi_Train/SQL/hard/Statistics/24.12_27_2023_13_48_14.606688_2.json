Missing Data: Some entries might have missing gender information, which would complicate the counting process.\n\n3.

Ambiguous Gender Indicators: The datatable might use ambiguous or non-traditional indicators for gender, making it difficult to categorize entries as strictly female.\n\n5. Language and Cultural Variations: The datatable might contain gender indicators in different languages or cultural terms that are not immediately recognizable without additional context.\n\n6. Data Size and Complexity: If the datatable is exceptionally large or complex, it might be challenging to process efficiently.\n\n7.
