        "Based on the provided data, there are 7 females in the dataset.\n\nThe data provided includes the following columns:\n\n* primeKey\n* gender\n* age\n* name\n* height\n* weight\n* color\n* status\n* salary\n* company\n* location\n\nTo determine the number of females, you need to examine the gender column and count the number of occurrences of female. From the provided data, it appears that there are 7 instances of female (i.e., female, Female, F) out of a total of 21 records. Therefore, the answer is 7.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some of these records may be duplicates or missing information, which could affect the final count.
