        "Based on the provided data, there are 5 females out of the total 13 people, so the number of females is 5.\n\nIn the first data table, you have:\n\n* Row a: Female (This is clearly female)\n* Row b: Female (This is also clearly female)\n* Row c: Female (This is also female)\n* Row d: Female (This is female too)\n* Row f: Female (If this was in the same data set, it would make it 5 out of 5. If not, then this might be another instance of a female, and the total could still be 5 out of 9.
