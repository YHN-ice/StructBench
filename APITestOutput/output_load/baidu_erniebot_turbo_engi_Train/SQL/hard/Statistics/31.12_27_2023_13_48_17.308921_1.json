        "Based on the provided data, the salary information is provided in two tables with two different systems:\n\n1. A salary system is given as an integer (salary in units),\n2. Another system provides salary in USD dollars.\n\nFurthermore, there is no common identifier or structure that makes it easier to determine how to join or combine the data from the two tables.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the data is consistent and the salary values are in USD, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. Extract the rows from the salary table where the salary is greater than 481,281.\n2. Join the rows from the other table based on some common identifier (primeKey).\n3. Count the number of people in the resulting table with a salary greater than 481,281.\n\nThe potential difficulties you mentioned are also relevant:\n\n* Missing or inconsistent data. This may be an issue with both tables or one of them only.\n* Duplicate records and missing primary keys.
