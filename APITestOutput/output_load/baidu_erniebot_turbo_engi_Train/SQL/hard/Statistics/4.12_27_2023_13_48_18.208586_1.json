        "从给定的表格中，您想了解那些薪资超过327599的人的数量。这是一个涉及到人数统计的问题，您可以通过遍历表格中的每一行，查找那些薪资超过327599的行。以下是一个简单的Python代码示例，可以用于解决这个问题：\n\n\n```python\n# 假设表格数据存储在一个名为table的字典中\ntable = {\n    \"primeKey\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\"],\n    \"gender\": [\"female\", \"male\", \"male\", \"male\", \"male\", \"male\", \"male\", \"male\", \"female\", \"female\", \"female\", \"female\", \"female\"],\n    \"age\": [14, 29, 31, 18, 46, 12, 32, 40, 35, 39, 28, 26, 28],\n    ...\n}\n\n# 初始化一个计数器来记录符合条件的员工数量\ncount = 0\n\n# 遍历表格中的每一行\nfor row in table:\n    # 检查薪资是否超过327599\n    if table[row]['salary'] > 327599:\n        # 如果薪资超过，则将计数器加一\n        count += 1\n\n# 输出结果\nprint(\"人数：\", count)\n```\n这段代码会遍历表格中的每一行，并检查每一行的薪资是否超过327599。如果薪资超过，那么计数器就会加一。最后，代码会输出符合条件的员工数量。请注意，这段代码只是一个简单的示例，实际的实现可能需要考虑更多的细节和异常情况。"
