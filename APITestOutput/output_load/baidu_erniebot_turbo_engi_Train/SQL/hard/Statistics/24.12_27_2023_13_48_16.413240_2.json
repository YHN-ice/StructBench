        "Based on the provided data, there are 9 females out of the total 14 people.\n\nYou can use the following formula to calculate the number of female people:\n\nTotal people = (primeKey column count * gender column count) - (status column count * male status count)\n\nTherefore, 9 = (2 * 4) - (2 * 1) where \"male status count\" represents rows with a male status, which translates to people who are not female.\n\nRemember, it is always good practice to double check your calculations by reviewing your data source or conducting additional validations to ensure accuracy."
