Multiple entries per person: If the table contains multiple rows with the same `primeKey` (indicating the same person) but different salary information, we'll need to determine which entry is correct or if they should be aggregated in some way.\n\n3. Data size and performance: If the data table is very large, performance considerations may need to be taken into account to efficiently process the data without excessive computation time.\n\n4. Incorrect or missing data: There may be entries with missing or incorrect salary data, which would need to be handled appropriately to avoid skewing the results.\n\n5. Ambiguity in the definition of \"salary\": The term \"salary\" could potentially refer to base salary, total compensation including bonuses, or some other form of earnings. Clarifying what is meant by \"salary\" in the context of the dataset would be necessary.\n\n6.
