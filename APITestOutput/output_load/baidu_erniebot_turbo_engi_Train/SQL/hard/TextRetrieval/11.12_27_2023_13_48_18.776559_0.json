It might require cross-referencing with other tables or files.\n\n5. **Complex Table Structures**: The data might be stored in a complex structure such as nested tables, merged cells, or split across columns in a way that makes it harder to parse programmatically.\n\n6. **Non-standard Formats**: The company name might be stored in a non-standard format that requires normalization or additional parsing to understand (e.g., acronyms, shorthand, or mixed with other data).\n\n7. **Data Privacy and Access Restrictions**: Depending on the source of the datatable, there might be privacy concerns or access restrictions that prohibit revealing certain pieces of information.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in Data Interpretation**: Sometimes, data can be interpreted in multiple ways due to ambiguous labels or overlapping categories, leading to uncertainty about which entry is correct.\n\nUnderstanding these potential issues will help in preparing to parse the datatable accurately and provide the correct information about the company of record for primeKey 'b'."
