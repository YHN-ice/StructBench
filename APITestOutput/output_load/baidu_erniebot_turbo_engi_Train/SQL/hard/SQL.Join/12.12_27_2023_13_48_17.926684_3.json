Missing Data: Some entries might be missing either the height or location information, which would necessitate a way to handle incomplete records.\n\n3. Multiple Entries per Person: Since the same primeKey indicates the same person, there could be multiple rows for a single individual.

Data Size and Scalability: If the datatable is very large, efficient parsing and querying methods will be needed to handle the data size without running into performance issues.\n\n5. Ambiguity in Height Measurement: Heights could be recorded in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches). There may need to be a conversion process to ensure all heights are compared using the same unit.\n\n6. Ambiguity in Location Data: The abbreviation \"CA\" might refer to California in the United States or it could potentially stand for another place (like Canada or an abbreviation within another country's addressing system). Clarification would be needed to ensure accuracy.\n\n7. Data Type Issues: Heights may be recorded as strings instead of numerical values, requiring conversion for numerical comparison.\n\n8. Complex Query Logic: The logic to determine who works in CA and is taller than 157 might need to account for various conditions and ensure that the criteria are correctly applied in the query.\n\n9. Data Errors and Outliers: There may be errors or outliers in the data that could skew results if not properly accounted for or cleaned up.\n\n10. Misinterpretation of \"taller than 157\": Does this mean strictly greater than 157, or does it include 157?
