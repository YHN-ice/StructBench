For example, height could be listed in different units (inches, centimeters) or states might be abbreviated or written in full.\n\n2. **Missing Data**: There may be missing entries for height or state, which would make it difficult to determine who satisfies both criteria.\n\n3. **Data Accuracy**: The data provided might have inaccuracies or typos that could affect the ability to correctly identify the people working in IL and their heights.\n\n4. **Duplicate Entries**: If there are duplicate rows with the same primeKey, we need to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n\n5. **Complex Query**: The query requires the combination of two conditional statements: working in IL and being taller than 157. This necessitates a proper logical operation to filter out the correct individuals.\n\n6. **Large Data Volume**: If the datatable is very large, it might be computationally intensive to parse through all records to find the answer, and might require efficient search algorithms or indexing.\n\n7. **Data Privacy & Security**: Depending on the sensitivity of the datatable, there may be privacy concerns or restrictions on accessing certain pieces of information.\n\n8. **Ambiguity in the term \"taller\"**: There must be clarity on whether 157 is inclusive or exclusive for someone to be considered taller.\n\nOnce we have the data table, we'll need to carefully address these potential issues to accurately answer your question."
