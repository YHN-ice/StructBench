Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles:\n\n1. Inconsistent Data Formats: If the table data is not standardized (for example, different formats for height such as cm, m, inches), it may require additional steps to convert all heights into a consistent measurement before comparison.\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: If any rows are missing information about height or work location, those records may need to be handled differently, such as excluding them from the count or making assumptions based on available data.\n\n3. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If the table is normalized and the information about a person's height and work location is spread across multiple rows with the same primeKey, care must be taken to accurately merge this information to determine eligibility.\n\n4. Incorrect or Ambiguous Data: There may be entries with incorrect data (e.g., typos in the state abbreviation) or ambiguous data (e.g., \"Texas\" vs. \"TX\"), requiring a decision on whether to include or exclude these entries.\n\n5. Large Dataset: If the dataset is very large, it could pose performance issues, necessitating efficient querying or parsing methods to handle the data volume.\n\n6. Duplicates: If there are duplicate entries for individuals, it might be necessary to de-duplicate the dataset to ensure accurate counts.\n\n7. Varied Key Names: The column names for relevant data (height and work location) may vary, so it's important to correctly identify which columns contain the information needed.\n\nOnce we receive the input file or data, we would need to address these potential obstacles in order to accurately count the number of individuals working in TX who are taller than 166."
