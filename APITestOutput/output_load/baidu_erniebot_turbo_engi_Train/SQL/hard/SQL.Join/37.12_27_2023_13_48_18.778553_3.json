Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that could arise while parsing the datatable:\n\n1. Inconsistent Data Formats: The height and location data could be presented in different formats (e.g., height in cm or inches, location as state code or full name), which may require conversion or normalization to perform accurate comparisons.\n\n2. Missing or Incomplete Data: Some entries might have missing information for either the work location or the height, making it necessary to handle such cases properly.\n\n3. Data Errors: The dataset may contain errors or typos, such as incorrect state codes or implausible height values, which could impact the accuracy of the results.\n\n4. Duplicate Records: If the data table includes multiple rows for the same person (indicated by a primeKey), we must ensure that each individual is only counted once.\n\n5. Large Dataset Size: If the datatable is very large, performance considerations might be necessary to ensure the question is answered efficiently.\n\n6. Complex Data Structure: If the data is not structured in a simple tabular form (e.g., nested JSON, XML), parsing might require additional steps to extract relevant information.\n\n7.
