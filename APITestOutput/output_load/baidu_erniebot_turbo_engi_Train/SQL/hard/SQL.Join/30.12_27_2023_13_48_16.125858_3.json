Missing or Inconsistent Data: If height or work location data is missing, inconsistently formatted, or contains errors, it can complicate the parsing process.\n\n3. Data Spread Across Rows: Information about a person's work location and height might be spread across different rows with the same primeKey. We will need to combine this information to make an accurate determination.\n\n4. Inconsistent Units: Height data could be in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, or feet). We need to standardize the measurements to compare them accurately.\n\n5. Complex Filtering: The task requires filtering the datatable based on two conditions (work location and height). We may need to apply multiple filters or conditions to extract the correct subset of individuals.\n\n6. Large Data Volumes: If the datatable is very large, it might be computationally intensive to process, and efficient parsing methods would be necessary.\n\n7. Ambiguous Location Identifiers: The abbreviation \"GA\" could refer to different things (e.g., the U.S. state of Georgia, a company named GA, etc.), so we must be sure we're interpreting \"GA\" correctly as a work location.\n\nWe will need to consider these challenges and ensure our approach is robust enough to handle these potential difficulties when parsing the datatable."
