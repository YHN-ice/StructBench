Data Accuracy: The data might contain errors or inaccuracies, such as typos in the height or state fields, which could lead to incorrect counts.\n\n4. Non-numeric Height Values: The height field could contain non-numeric values or descriptors that need to be converted or filtered out before comparison (e.g., '6ft' instead of a numeric value).\n\n5. Multiple Rows for the Same Person: As the same primeKey indicates the same person, there might be multiple rows for the same individual with different pieces of their information, which requires careful merging of the data to avoid double-counting.\n\n6. Performance Issues: If the datatable is very large, performance issues might arise, necessitating efficient querying or data handling techniques.\n\n7.
