Missing Data: Some rows may have incomplete information, such as missing height or location details.\n\n3. Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If the data about a person's location and height is spread across rows with a common primeKey, we'll need to ensure we're correctly aggregating this information.\n\n4.

Data Parsing Errors: Errors can occur in the process of extracting and converting data from the table if the parser does not handle the format or structure correctly.\n\n8.
