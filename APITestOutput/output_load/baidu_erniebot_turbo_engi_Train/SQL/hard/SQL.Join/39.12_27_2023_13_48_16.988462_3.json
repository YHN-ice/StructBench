Multiple data tables: If the information is spread across different tables, we need to ensure proper joining or merging of data based on a common key (primeKey) to get a holistic view of each person's data.\n\n2. Inconsistent data formats: Heights could be recorded in different units (e.g., inches, feet) or have inconsistent formatting within the same table, requiring conversion and standardization before comparison.\n\n3. Missing data: Some entries might lack height or work location information, necessitating a decision on handling incomplete records.\n\n4. Data errors: There could be typographical errors in the data, such as incorrect height values or misspelled state abbreviations, which could lead to inaccuracies unless cleaned or corrected.\n\n5. Duplication: The same person might be listed more than once (with the same primeKey), so we must ensure that each individual is only counted once.\n\n6. Multiple attributes in one column: Sometimes, data such as height and work location might be combined in a single column, making it more complex to filter and analyze.\n\n7. Performance issues: If the dataset is very large, the process of filtering and calculating may require efficient methods to avoid long processing times.\n\n8. Ambiguity in location specification: The abbreviation \"HI\" should clearly represent Hawaii, but if the dataset includes non-standard abbreviations or similar abbreviations for different locations, it might create confusion.\n\n9. Textual representation of numbers: Heights might be stored as text rather than numerical values, requiring conversion before any numerical comparison can be performed.\n\n10. Privacy and data handling concerns: Depending on the content of the datatables, there might be privacy considerations to take into account when handling and presenting the data.\n\nOnce the datatable is provided, these potential difficulties can be addressed by applying appropriate data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques."
