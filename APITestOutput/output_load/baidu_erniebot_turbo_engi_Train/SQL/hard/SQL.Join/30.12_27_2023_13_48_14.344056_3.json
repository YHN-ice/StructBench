Multiple Entries: Individuals might have multiple rows with the same primeKey but different information. Ensuring that each individual is only counted once requires careful handling of the data.\n\n3. Missing Data: Some rows might have missing values for either the location or the height, which would require a decision on how to handle these cases.\n\n4. Data Format: The height information might not be in a numeric format, which could require additional parsing or conversion to determine if it is greater than 170.\n\n5. Differing Keys: If the primeKey is not consistent or has errors, it may be difficult to accurately determine when multiple rows refer to the same person.\n\n6. Performance Issues: If the datatable is very large, the performance of the parser could be an issue, leading to long processing times.\n\n7. Ambiguity in Location: The location \"HI\" might refer to Hawaii, but without context, it could also mean something else. We need to ensure that \"HI\" unambiguously refers to the intended location.\n\n8. Complex Filtering: The combination of conditions (working in HI and being taller than 170) might require complex filtering logic.\n\nPlease provide the input file or datatable so that I can proceed with finding the answer while addressing these potential difficulties."
