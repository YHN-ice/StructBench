These include:\n\n* Person \"a\", male, height: 211 cm\n* Person \"g\", male, height: 174 cm\n* Person \"i\", male, height: 220 cm\n* Person \"l\", female, height: 177 cm\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is: 4 people who work in GA are taller than 171 cm.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need clarification, please let me know!"
