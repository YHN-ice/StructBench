Data Spread Across Multiple Rows: If the data is normalized such that the height information and place of employment are in separate rows but linked by a primeKey, we will need to join this information based on the primeKey.\n\n4. Non-numeric Height Values: Heights could be recorded in units other than centimeters or could include non-numeric characters, requiring conversion or cleanup.\n\n5. Varying State Representations: The state of employment could be represented by full names, abbreviations, or even possibly misspelled, which would necessitate normalization to ensure accuracy.\n\n6.
