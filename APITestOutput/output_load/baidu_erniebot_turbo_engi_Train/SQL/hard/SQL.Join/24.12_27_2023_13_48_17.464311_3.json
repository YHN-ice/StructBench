Data Format: The format of the input file can present challenges, especially if the data is not structured in a way that easily allows for filtering by state and height.\n\n2. Multiple Entries: If the datatable includes multiple rows with the same primeKey (i.e., referring to the same person), care must be taken to count each person only once.\n\n3. Inconsistent Units: If the datatable includes heights in different units (e.g., centimeters and inches), a conversion process must be applied to standardize all heights to the same unit for accurate comparison.\n\n4. Missing Data: There may be missing or incomplete data entries for some individuals, such as missing height or state information, which could complicate the process of tallying.\n\n5. Data Size: The size of the datatable could be large, which may require efficient parsing techniques to quickly identify and count relevant entries.\n\n6. Data Errors: There may be errors or inconsistencies in the data which could lead to inaccurate tallies if not properly handled (e.g., typos in state abbreviations).\n\n7.
