Column Identifiers: The datatable should have appropriate column headers or identifiers to distinguish between height, state of employment, and other relevant data.\n3. Inconsistent Units: Heights could be provided in different units (inches, meters, etc.), requiring a conversion to a common unit for comparison.\n4. Missing Data: Some entries may have missing or incomplete information regarding height or work location.\n5. Data Accuracy: The data provided might have inaccuracies or typos that could lead to incorrect categorization of individuals' heights or work locations.\n6. Duplicate Entries: The datatable may contain duplicate entries for individuals, which would require deduplication based on the primeKey to ensure accurate counts.\n7.
