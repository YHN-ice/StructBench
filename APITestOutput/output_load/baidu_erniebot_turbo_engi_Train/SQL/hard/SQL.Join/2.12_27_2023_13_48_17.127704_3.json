Data Separation: If the datatable contains multiple attributes spread across different tables, it may be necessary to join or correlate data based on a primary key or unique identifier.\n\n2. Data Inconsistency: Inconsistent data entries, such as variations in state representation (e.g., \"California,\" \"CA,\" \"Calif.\"), could lead to inaccuracies if not standardized before processing.\n\n3. Missing Data: Some records might have incomplete information regarding height or work location. Handling such missing data appropriately is crucial for accurate counts.\n\n4. Duplicate Records: The same individual might appear multiple times in the dataset. Ensuring that each person is counted only once requires careful deduplication.\n\n5. Data Format: Heights could be recorded in different units (e.g., centimeters, meters, inches). Converting all measurements to the same unit is necessary for comparison.\n\n6. Data Types and Parsing: Ensuring that data types are correctly parsed (e.g., numeric data for heights) is important to perform comparisons and arithmetic operations.\n\n7. Filtering Criteria: Applying multiple filters accurately—in this case, both location (CA) and height (greater than 173)—while ensuring no relevant data is omitted.\n\n8. Performance Issues: Large datasets might present performance challenges, requiring efficient querying and data handling techniques to process the information quickly.\n\n9. Ambiguity in \"CA\": The abbreviation \"CA\" could potentially refer to different things, though in the context of work location, it is likely to mean California. Clarification may be needed if there's ambiguity.\n\nUnderstanding these potential obstacles will help us prepare for the parsing process and ensure that we implement a robust approach to accurately count the number of people meeting the specified criteria."
