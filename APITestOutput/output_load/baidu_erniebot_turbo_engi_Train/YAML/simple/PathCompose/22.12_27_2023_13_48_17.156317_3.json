Handling and accessing values in heterogeneous lists can be more complicated.\n\n6. **Implicit vs Explicit Typing**: YAML has implicit typing, which can lead to values being interpreted as different data types than intended unless explicitly specified.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: YAML is whitespace-sensitive and relies on indentation for structure, so incorrect spacing can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy.\n\n8. **Large Files and Performance**: Parsing large YAML files can be memory-intensive and slow, depending on the parser used.\n\n9. **Version Differences**: There are multiple versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1, 1.2), and some features or syntax may differ between them, potentially affecting parsing.\n\n10. **Encoding and Character Sets**: If the YAML file uses a character set or encoding that is not properly handled by the parser, this could lead to incorrect interpretation of the content.\n\nAddressing these potential obstacles would involve careful handling of the YAML syntax rules, proper use of the parser's capabilities, and a clear understanding of the structure of the specific YAML file in question.
