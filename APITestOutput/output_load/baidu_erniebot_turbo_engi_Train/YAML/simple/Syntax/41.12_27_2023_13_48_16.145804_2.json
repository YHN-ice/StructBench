Mistakes in this syntax can cause errors.\n3. **Duplicated Keys**: Having more than one entry with the same key within the same scope is not allowed.\n4. **Improper Scalars**: Scalars (unquoted strings) that contain special characters or resemble data types YAML interprets differently (like 'yes', 'no', 'true', 'false') can cause unexpected behavior.\n5. **Incorrect Use of Collections (Lists and Maps)**: Confusion between lists and maps or incorrect nesting can lead to errors.\n6. **Improper Handling of Multiline Strings**: There are specific ways to handle strings that span multiple lines, such as the use of `>` or `|`.
