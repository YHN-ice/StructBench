Missing Colons: Key-value pairs in YAML require a colon followed by a space.\n4. Dashes and Lists: Improper use of dashes can lead to list-related issues.\n5. Duplicate Keys: Having the same key more than once in a map is typically not allowed.\n6. Invalid Characters: Certain characters may need to be escaped or quoted.\n7.
