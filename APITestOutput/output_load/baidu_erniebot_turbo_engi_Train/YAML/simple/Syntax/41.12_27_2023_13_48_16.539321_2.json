Any deviation in expected indentation can lead to a structural error.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Tab Usage**: Tabs and spaces should not be mixed for indentation; it's typically recommended to use spaces.\n\n3. **Incorrect Data Types**: YAML allows for a variety of data types (strings, integers, arrays, objects, etc.). If the wrong data type is used, it can cause issues.\n\n4. **Improper Key-Value Pair Syntax**: All key-value pairs should follow the correct syntax with a colon and space after the key.\n\n5. **Duplicated Keys**: In YAML, keys within the same level should be unique. Duplicated keys can cause conflicts.\n\n6. **Improper Handling of Special Characters**: Special characters in strings may need to be escaped or contained within quotes.\n\n7. **Missing or Extra Delimiters**: Sequences (lists) and mappings (dictionaries) should start and end with proper delimiters.\n\n8. **Flow Style vs Block Style Confusion**: Mixing flow style (inline) with block style inappropriately can lead to errors.\n\n9. **Poorly Formed Multi-line Strings**: When using multi-line strings, care must be taken to use the correct indicators and indentation.\n\n10. **Malformed Directives or Tags**: If directives or tags are used, they must follow the correct syntax.\n\n11. **Sequences/Mappings Nested Incorrectly**: The nesting must align with the intended structure; otherwise, this will result in a logical error as opposed to a parsing error.\n\n12. **Trailing Whitespace**: Although not often a syntactic error, trailing whitespace can lead to unexpected behaviors in some parsers.\n\nOnce we have the actual YAML content, we can check for these potential issues to determine if there are any structural errors."
