If there are duplicates, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n5. **Missing Colons**: After a key, a colon is required to separate it from its value.\n6. **Improper Quotes**: If special characters are included in strings, they should be properly escaped or enclosed in quotes.\n7. **Sequences/Lists Errors**: Errors can occur in the representation of lists, such as improper alignment of list items.\n8. **Mapping Errors**: A mapping error can occur if a value is not provided for a key or the key-value pair is not formatted correctly.\n9. **Tab Characters**: YAML does not allow tabs for indentation; spaces must be used.\n\nPlease provide the YAML content for which you want to check structural errors, and I will assist you."
