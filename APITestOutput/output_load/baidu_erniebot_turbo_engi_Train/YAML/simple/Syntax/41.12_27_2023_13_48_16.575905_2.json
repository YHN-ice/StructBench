Spaces are used to denote structure; however, tabs are not allowed for indentation. Improperly indented keys or values could cause structural errors.\n\n2. **Key-Value Pairs**: Inconsistent or incorrect use of key-value pairs can result in errors. Keys should be followed by a colon and a space before their value.\n\n3. **Sequences and Mappings**: Lists (sequences) should be properly denoted with a dash and a space (`- `), and nested sequences or mappings should be correctly indented relative to their parent elements.\n\n4. **Data Types**: YAML automatically detects data types, and if a value looks like a number, boolean, or null, it will treat it as such unless specified otherwise with quotes. Incorrect interpretation of data types can lead to problems when the YAML is parsed.\n\n5. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows for the use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) to repeat content. Errors in defining or using anchors and aliases could introduce issues.\n\n6. **Syntax**: Errors in basic syntax such as missing colons, incorrect use of quotes, improper multiline strings, etc., can also lead to structural issues.\n\n7. **Document Start and End Indicators**: While these are optional (`---` for start and `...` for end), incorrect use or placement can cause confusion or errors when parsing multiple documents in a single YAML file.\n\n8. **Comments**: Comments should not interfere with the structure but should be clearly marked with the `#` character.\n\n9. **Compatibility Issues**: There may be differences between YAML versions (1.1 and 1.2), which could potentially lead to misinterpretation if the parser expects a different version from the one used.\n\n10. **Encoding**: Non-ASCII characters could be an issue if not properly encoded or if the parser does not handle them well.\n\nTo accurately identify any potential structural errors, it will be necessary to examine the YAML content closely while keeping these common pitfalls in mind."
