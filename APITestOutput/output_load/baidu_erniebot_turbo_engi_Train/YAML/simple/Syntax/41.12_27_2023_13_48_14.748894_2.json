For example, colons must be followed by a space to correctly denote key-value pairs.\n\n4. **Complex structures:** When YAML contains nested structures or references, it can be tricky to maintain the right scope and references without mistakes.\n\n5. **Version compatibility:** YAML has different versions (e.g., 1.1 and 1.2), and some features from one version might not work correctly in another, leading to potential compatibility issues.\n\nOnce I see the YAML content, I will check for these common pitfalls to determine if there are any structural errors."
