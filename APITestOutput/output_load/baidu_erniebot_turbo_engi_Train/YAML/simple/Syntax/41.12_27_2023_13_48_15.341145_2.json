Repeated keys are often misinterpreted or cause errors.\n6. **Complex Structures:** Sequences within sequences or mappings within mappings require careful attention to indentation and structure to ensure they are parsed correctly.\n\nTo determine if the given YAML file has structural errors, I would look for these common issues during parsing.
