Indentation Errors: YAML uses indentation to represent structure, so incorrect indentation can lead to structural errors. Each level of indentation typically consists of two or four spaces.\n\n2. Incorrect Use of Dashes: A dash is used to define list items in YAML. If dashes are not properly used, for example, not consistently aligned or missing where a list item is expected, it can cause errors.\n\n3. Missing Colons: Colons are used after keys in key-value pairs. Missing colons can result in keys not being recognized properly.\n\n4. Scalar Content Issues: Incorrect handling of scalar content (like unquoted strings containing special characters, or multi-line strings not properly formatted) can cause parsing problems.\n\n5. Mapping Problems: If a mapping (which is essentially a key-value pair) is not set up properly with a key followed by a colon and then a value, it can result in an error.\n\n6. Sequence Entry Issues: If an entry in a sequence (list) is formatted incorrectly or placed outside the expected indentation level, it can lead to errors.\n\n7. Tab Characters: Tabs are not allowed for indentation in YAML; only spaces can be used. If tabs are present, they will cause an error.\n\n8. Duplicate Keys: Having two identical keys within the same map is not allowed and will result in an error.\n\n9. Incorrectly paired quotes: Single or double quotes that are not correctly opened and closed can lead to errors when defining string values.\n\nOnce I see the input YAML file, I will check against these common issues to determine whether there are any structural errors."
