Incorrect indentation can lead to a misinterpretation of the data hierarchy.\n\n2. **Data Types**: Implicit and explicit data types need to be handled correctly. For instance, strings that look like other data types (e.g., numbers, booleans) might need to be quoted to be interpreted correctly.\n\n3. **Complex Data Structures**: YAML can contain complex nested structures like lists and dictionaries. Ensuring these are correctly formatted is essential for proper parsing.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: YAML has certain reserved characters and special indicators like `---` for document start, `...` for document end, `#` for comments, etc. These need to be used correctly to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Anchors and Aliases**: YAML supports anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) for duplicating content. If used improperly, they could lead to errors in parsing.\n\n6. **Multiple Documents**: YAML can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. This needs to be correctly identified to parse each document separately.\n\n7. **Directives and Tags**: YAML can include directives (like `%YAML 1.2`) and tags (like `!!str`) which could cause issues if not used properly.\n\nOnce we see the actual YAML content, we'll have to check for these potential issues and others to determine whether there is any structural error."
