Misalignment of map entries: In a map, keys and their corresponding values must be aligned with the same indentation level.\n4. Missing or extra colons or dashes: Colons are used after keys, and dashes are used for list items. Missing or improperly placed colons or dashes can cause errors.\n5. Improper handling of complex data structures: Nested structures must be properly indented and formatted.\n6. Scalar content issues: Scalars must be properly formatted, and special characters may need to be escaped or quoted.\n7. Inconsistent data types: When a key has multiple values throughout the document, they must have consistent data types, unless explicitly intended.\n8. Duplicate keys: Each key in a map must be unique.\n\nWithout the actual YAML content, it's impossible to analyze or find any structural errors.
