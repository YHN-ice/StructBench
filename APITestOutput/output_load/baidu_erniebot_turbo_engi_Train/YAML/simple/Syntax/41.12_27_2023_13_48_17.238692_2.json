Mappings should follow the `key: value` structure.\n\n4. **Data types**: Improper quoting or lack of quotes when needed could lead to misinterpretation of data types (e.g., interpreting a string as a boolean).\n\n5. **Syntax errors**: These could include misplaced or missing colons, quotes, dashes, or other symbols vital for correctly structuring a YAML document.\n\n6. **Duplicated keys**: Each key within a map must be unique; duplicated keys could cause unexpected behavior or errors.\n\nNow that we've outlined potential issues, please provide the YAML content for analysis to determine if there are any structural errors."
