Incorrect indentation: YAML relies on indentation to delineate structure, similar to Python.

Improper key-value pairs: Each key-value pair should be separated by a colon and a space.\n\n3. Incorrect usage of lists and dictionaries: Lists should be denoted with a dash and a space ('- '), and dictionaries must have key-value pairs.\n\n4. Scalar content issues: Multiline text (scalars) may require special indicators like `|` or `>` and correct indentation.\n\n5. Missing or extra spaces after colons or dashes.\n\n6. Improper handling of special characters: Characters like colons, commas, spaces, or hyphens within a string may need to be enclosed in quotes.\n\n7.

The indentation is correct, key-value pairs are separated by a colon and a space, and the usage of lists and dictionaries is also correct. The scalar content also seems to be formatted correctly.
