This can lead to missing the correct path to the desired information.\n\n6. **Inheritance and References:** YAML supports complex features like node anchoring, aliases, and inheritance. These features could be used in ways that make it non-trivial to determine the first object's `id`.\n\n7. **Data Types and Casting:** Ensuring that the data types are correctly understood, especially when parsing values like numbers or booleans, is important.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, I need a well-structured YAML input with a clear context for where to find `subs` and what data is expected.
