Here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise while trying to answer the question about the first object's id of `subs`:\n\n1. **Complex Hierarchies:** YAML files can contain nested structures. If the `subs` key is deeply nested or not clearly indicated, it could be challenging to locate.\n\n2. **Sequence vs. Mapping:** YAML allows both sequences (lists) and mappings (key-value pairs). The `subs` key might be part of a sequence or a mapping, and identifying the first object within it depends on correctly interpreting this structure.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors:** YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors, which allow for the reuse of elements without repetition. If these are used in the `subs` section, it might complicate the retrieval of the `id`.\n\n4. **Consistent Formatting:** YAML is sensitive to indentation and formatting. Inconsistent indentation might lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the data structure.\n\n5. **Data Types:** YAML supports various data types. Ensuring that the `id` is interpreted with the correct type (e.g., string vs. integer) is essential for providing an accurate answer.\n\n6. **Variations in Keys:** The `id` key might have variations in its naming (e.g., `ID`, `Id`, or `identifier`) which could make it harder to locate without knowing the exact key used.\n\n7. **Multiple Documents:** A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If `subs` appears in more than one document, determining which document's `subs` to look at could be a challenge.\n\nOnce you provide me with the YAML input, I will parse it according to its structure and retrieve the requested information."
