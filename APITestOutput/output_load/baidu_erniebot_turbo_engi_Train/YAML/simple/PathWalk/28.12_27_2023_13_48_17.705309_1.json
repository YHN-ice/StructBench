Ensuring accurate retrieval of this value requires careful parsing.\n\n5. **Ambiguous query**: If the question lacks context, for example, if there are multiple objects that could feasibly be the \"first object\" due to how they are ordered or presented, this might require clarification before providing an accurate answer.\n\n6. **File accessibility**: If the file contents are not provided or cannot be accessed, then we won't be able to parse the information and extract the requested data.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML content, I can proceed to parse it and identify the first object's `id` within the `subs` collection."
