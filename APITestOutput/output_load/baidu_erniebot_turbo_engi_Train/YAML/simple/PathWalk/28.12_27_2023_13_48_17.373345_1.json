        "From your provided YAML file, it seems like you are trying to navigate a nested structure that represents a hierarchical data structure. The 'subs' object has a list of objects within it, and you want to identify the first object's 'id'.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Identify the 'subs' object in the hierarchy:\n\n\n```yaml\nid: \"h\"\nZ: g\nsubs:\n  - id: \"i\"\n    Y: f\n    subs:\n      - id: \"j\"\n        X: e\n        subs: []\n```\n2. You want to find the first object within the 'subs' list, so you need to access the first item of the 'subs' list. To do this, you can use the `first` method from the `pyyaml` library.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nwith open('your_file.yaml') as file:\n    data = yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)\n    first_object_id = data['subs'][0]['id']  # assuming there is always a first item in the 'subs' list\n    print(first_object_id)\n```\nThis should give you the 'id' of the first object within the 'subs' list. If you want to check if there is indeed a first item in the list, you can add a check before accessing the 'id':\n\n\n```python\nif len(data['subs']) > 0:\n    first_object_id = data['subs'][0]['id']\n    print(first_object_id)\nelse:\n    print(\"No items found in the 'subs' list.\")\n```\nMake sure to replace 'your_file.yaml' with the actual path to your YAML file."
