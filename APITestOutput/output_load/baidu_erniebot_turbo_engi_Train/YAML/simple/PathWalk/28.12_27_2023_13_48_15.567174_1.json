If the \"subs\" object is referenced elsewhere in the document, it might not be immediately obvious what its contents are without properly resolving these references.\n\n4. **Inherent File Errors**: If the YAML file is poorly formatted or contains errors, it might not be parsable without correction.\n\n5. **Incorrect Data Types**: If data types are not what is expected (for example, \"id\" is assumed to be a string or number, but it is presented as a list or dictionary), it could cause confusion when attempting to retrieve the information.\n\n6. **Multiple Entries**: If there are multiple \"subs\" objects, we need to determine which one is considered the \"first\" object. This could depend on their ordering in the document or other contextual clues.\n\n7. **YAML Version**: Different versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1 vs 1.2) might have slight differences in parsing rules, which could affect interpretation.\n\nPlease provide the YAML file or its contents so I can proceed with answering your question."
