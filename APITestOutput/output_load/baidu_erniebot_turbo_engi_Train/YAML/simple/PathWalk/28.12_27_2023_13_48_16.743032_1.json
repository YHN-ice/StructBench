As a human mimicking a YAML file parser, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process:\n\n1. **Complex Structure**: YAML files can have complex structures with nested lists and dictionaries. Understanding the level at which 'subs' is located within the hierarchy is crucial.\n\n2. **Sequence and Mapping Confusion**: YAML uses sequences (lists) and mappings (dictionaries). If 'subs' is not clearly identified as a sequence or mapping, it could lead to confusion.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows for aliases and anchors which can be used to refer to other parts of the document. If 'subs' or its contents are referenced via an anchor elsewhere, it could complicate the extraction of the 'id'.\n\n4. **YAML Version**: YAML has different versions (1.1, 1.2), and some features may differ between versions. Knowledge of the specific version might be necessary.\n\n5. **Inheritance and Overriding**: In some instances, objects within a YAML file can inherit properties from others, or certain properties may be overridden later in the document.\n\n6. **Formatting Issues**: YAML is sensitive to indentation and formatting. Improper indentation could lead to misinterpretation of the hierarchy of elements.\n\n7. **Comments**: YAML allows for comments which are ignored by parsers. Ensuring that actual data isn't mistaken for a comment is important.\n\n8. **Data Types**: Understanding and correctly interpreting data types for each element (like distinguishing between strings, numbers, etc.).\n\nOnce I have access to the YAML file content, I can parse it according to its structure to identify the first object's 'id' within 'subs'. Please provide the YAML content to proceed with answering your question."
