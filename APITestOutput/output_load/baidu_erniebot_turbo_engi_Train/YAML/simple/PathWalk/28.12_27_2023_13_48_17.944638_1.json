The parser needs to account for these variations to accurately extract the information.\n\n7. **Special Characters in Values**: Special characters in the values can sometimes cause issues if not handled properly by the parser.\n\n8. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`.
