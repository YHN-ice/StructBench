The first object's `id` of `subs` refers to retrieving the value associated with the `id` key from the first item in the list that is mapped to the `subs` key. Some potential difficulties and obstacles that might hinder the process could include:\n\n1. **Incorrect File Format**: If the YAML file is not properly formatted, it can lead to parsing errors. YAML is sensitive to indentation, and a common mistake is having incorrect indentation levels.\n\n2. **Complex Hierarchies**: YAML files can have complex nested structures. Understanding the hierarchy and navigating to the correct level to find the required `id` key might be challenging without knowing the exact structure.\n\n3. **Multiple Entries with Similar Names**: There may be multiple `subs` keys or `id` keys at different levels of indentation, and identifying which one is the \"first\" or \"correct\" one can be tricky without context.\n\n4. **Aliases and References**: YAML supports aliases and anchors, which can be used to reference other parts of the document. If these are used, one must correctly resolve the reference to get to the actual data.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, efficiently parsing and locating the desired information could require more sophisticated processing to avoid performance issues.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in \"First\" Object**: The concept of \"first\" can be ambiguous if not properly defined. For example, if `subs` contains a list, then \"first\" is straightforward, but if `subs` is a dictionary with unordered keys, then \"first\" might not have a clear meaning.\n\nPlease provide the YAML input so I can attempt to parse it and answer your question."
