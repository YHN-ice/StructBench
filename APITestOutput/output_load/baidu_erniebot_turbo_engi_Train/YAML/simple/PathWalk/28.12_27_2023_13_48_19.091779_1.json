It's important to navigate these correctly to find the required information.\n\n2. **Aliases and Anchors:** YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors which can create references within the file. If used, it might be necessary to resolve these references to get the correct data.\n\n3. **Data Types:** YAML supports various data types like strings, numbers, nulls, dates, etc. Ensuring that the data is interpreted with the correct type is essential.\n\n4. **Variations in Syntax:** There can be different ways to represent the same data structure in YAML, such as inline or block notation for lists and dictionaries.\n\n5. **Inheritance and Extensions:** In some cases, YAML files might use extensions that allow for inheriting properties from other objects within the file, making the structure more complex.\n\n6. **Comments:** YAML allows comments, which should be ignored when parsing.\n\n7. **Special Characters:** Handling special characters and ensuring they are parsed correctly (e.g., colons in strings, commas in lists) is crucial.\n\n8. **Large Files and Performance:** If the YAML file is very large, performance considerations may come into play when parsing it.\n\nOnce I have access to the YAML content, I can proceed with identifying the first object's id within the `subs` section while keeping these potential difficulties in mind."
