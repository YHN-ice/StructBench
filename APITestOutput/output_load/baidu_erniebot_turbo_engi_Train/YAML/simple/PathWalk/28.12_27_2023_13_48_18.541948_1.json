If the data types are not used correctly or as expected, it could lead to confusion in interpreting the data.\n\n4. **References & Anchors**: YAML allows defining anchors and using them later as references. In case anchors and references are used, understanding the actual values might require additional steps to resolve these references.\n\n5. **Formatting Issues**: YAML is sensitive to indentation and formatting. Improper formatting might lead to an incorrect interpretation of the structure, which could result in erroneous output.\n\n6. **Version Differences**: YAML has different versions (1.1, 1.2, etc.), and there might be subtle differences in parsing rules between these versions.\n\n7. **Size of the File**: A very large YAML file could make it difficult to manually find specific information or could pose performance concerns with some parsers.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML file, I'll work through these potential obstacles to correctly identify the first object's `id` of `subs`."
