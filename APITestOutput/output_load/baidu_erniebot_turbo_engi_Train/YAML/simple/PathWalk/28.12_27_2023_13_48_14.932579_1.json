If there are multiple keys with the name 'subs', it could be unclear which one you're referring to.\n\n5. **Data types and structures:** YAML supports various data types and structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries). If 'subs' is not a list as expected, but instead a dictionary or another structure, it might complicate extracting the 'id'.\n\n6. **Missing or Null values:** The 'id' for the first object in 'subs' might be missing or null, which would mean there isn't a straightforward answer.\n\nTo proceed, I would need to see the input YAML file so I could parse it and find the 'id' of the first object within 'subs'."
