Determining which one is being referred to could be challenging.\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) which can lead to objects being referenced indirectly. If the `subs` list or its objects use these features, it might complicate locating the first `id`.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be difficult to parse it efficiently or find the relevant section without an appropriate parsing tool or method.\n\n6. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types. If the `id` is expected to be a string but is not quoted properly, it could be interpreted as another data type like a number or boolean.\n\n7. **Key Names**: There might be keys with similar names to `id`, such as `Id` or `ID`, leading to potential confusion.\n\n8. **Missing Keys**: It's possible that the first object in `subs` does not have an `id` key, which would mean there's no `id` to report.\n\n9. **Embedded Documents**: YAML allows for documents within documents delineated by `---`.
