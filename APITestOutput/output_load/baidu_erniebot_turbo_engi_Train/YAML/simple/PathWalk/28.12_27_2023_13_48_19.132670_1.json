If the `subs` key contains a deeply nested or complicated structure, it may make parsing more challenging.\n3. **Ambiguity in the Question:** The term \"first object\" might be ambiguous if the `subs` list contains different types of items, such as strings or dictionaries. We need to assume that 'object' refers to a structured data type like a dictionary.\n4. **Multiple Documents:** YAML allows for multiple documents within a single file, separated by `---`. If there are multiple documents, it should be clear which one contains the `subs` key we are interested in.\n\nPlease provide the YAML file content, and I will parse it to locate the `subs` key and determine the `id` of the first object within it."
