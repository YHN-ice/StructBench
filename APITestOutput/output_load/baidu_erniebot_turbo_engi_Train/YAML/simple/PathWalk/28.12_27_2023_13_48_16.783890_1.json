In order to provide an accurate answer, it is necessary to have access to the YAML file content to identify the structure and elements within it.\n\nHere are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **YAML File Structure**: YAML files are sensitive to indentation and structure. If the indentation is not consistent or correct, it may be difficult to determine the hierarchy and relationships between objects.\n\n2. **Key Names and Values**: Without knowing the specific key names and hierarchy within the YAML file, it is impossible to determine what constitutes the \"first object\" or the \"id\" of a sub-object.\n\n3. **Multiple Documents**: YAML allows for multiple documents within a single file, separated by `---`. The \"first object\" could be ambiguous if there are multiple documents.\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors, which can create references in the file. It can be challenging to follow these references without being able to see the entire file.\n\n5. **Data Types and Complex Structures**: YAML supports complex data types such as dictionaries, lists, nested objects, etc. Understanding the context of how these are used in the file is important in determining the correct answer.\n\n6. **Large Files and Scalability**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be difficult to parse through all of it manually to find the specific \"first object\" or \"id\".\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, it’s important to view and analyze the YAML file content to determine the structure and access the specific elements requested.
