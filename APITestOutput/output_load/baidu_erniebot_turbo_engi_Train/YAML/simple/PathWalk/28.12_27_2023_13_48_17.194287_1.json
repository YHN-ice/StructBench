These should refer to specific elements in the YAML structure. It's important to understand the hierarchy and naming conventions used in the file.\n\n3. **Complex data structures**: The YAML file might contain nested structures such as lists, dictionaries, or a combination thereof. Navigating these structures to find the correct \"first object\" might be complex.\n\n4. **Large files**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be challenging to locate the relevant section quickly.\n\n5. **Special YAML features**: YAML supports advanced features such as anchors, aliases, and extended data types, which could complicate the extraction of information.\n\n6. **Encoding and character issues**: The file might use special characters or have encoding issues that could affect how strings like \"id\" or \"subs\" are parsed and matched.\n\n7. **Version differences**: There are multiple versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1, 1.2), and there might be slight differences in how certain features are supported or interpreted.\n\nThese are some of the potential challenges I would be prepared to address when parsing a YAML file to extract specific information.
