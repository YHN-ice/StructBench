If there are multiple documents in the file, it needs to be clear which document contains the \"subs\" object.\n\n5. **Large files and performance**: If the YAML file is particularly large, it could be challenging to efficiently parse and find the necessary information without performance issues.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in keys**: If there are multiple keys with the same name at different levels of hierarchy or in different objects, it may be ambiguous which one is being referred to.\n\n7. **Variant data types**: Depending on the specific contents of the \"subs\" list, the \"id\" might be a string, a number, or another data type.
