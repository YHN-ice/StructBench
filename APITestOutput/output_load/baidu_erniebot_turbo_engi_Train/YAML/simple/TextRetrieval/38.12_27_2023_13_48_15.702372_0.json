Complex Data Structures: The YAML file may contain nested structures such as lists within dictionaries (maps) or vice versa, which can be complex to navigate and extract information from.\n\n2. References and Anchors: YAML allows for the use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) to refer to repeated content within the file. Understanding these references is crucial to accurately interpret the data.\n\n3. Multiline Strings: YAML supports multiline strings, which can be represented using literal block scalars (`|`) or folded block scalars (`>`). Parsing and retaining the intended format of these strings may pose a challenge.\n\n4. Data Types: YAML is a typed language, meaning that strings, numbers, booleans, and null types are identified differently. Ensuring that the correct data type is interpreted and returned is important.\n\n5. Inheritance and Overriding: When using inheritance with the `<<` merge key, the parser must handle merging of the inherited data correctly while also respecting any overridden values.\n\n6. Special Characters: Handling special characters and ensuring they are appropriately escaped or included in the output is crucial.\n\n7. Comments: YAML supports comments using the `#` symbol. These should be ignored during parsing if only the data is required.\n\n8. Indentation: YAML relies on indentation to denote structure. Incorrect indentation can lead to misinterpretation of the hierarchy of elements.\n\n9. Version compatibility: YAML has different versions (e.g., 1.1, 1.2), and some syntax or features may differ between versions.\n\n10. Custom Tags and Extensions: Some YAML files might contain custom tags or use schema extensions that are not part of the core YAML specification.\n\nAfter considering these potential difficulties, please provide me with the YAML file content so that I can parse it and answer your question regarding the object with id 'y'."
