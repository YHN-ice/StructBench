The parser must be able to resolve these references correctly.\n\n4. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types such as strings, numbers, nulls, dates, etc. It's important to correctly interpret these types, especially when they are implicit.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, finding the relevant section can be time-consuming. Efficient search mechanisms are necessary.\n\n6. **Encoding**: Text encoding issues may arise if the file contains special characters or is saved with an encoding that is not properly recognized.\n\n7. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. This could be an obstacle if not handled properly, as we need to determine which document contains the desired information.\n\nPlease provide the YAML input, and I will assist further with retrieving the information requested."
