Complex Nesting Structures: YAML allows for complex nesting with both lists (arrays) and dictionaries (maps), which can make it challenging to determine the depth of any given entry.\n\n2. Mixed Data Types: A YAML file can contain nested elements of different types (e.g., lists, dictionaries, strings, numbers). You may need to handle each type differently when determining depth.\n\n3. Aliases and Anchors: YAML supports the use of anchors and aliases to reuse content. This feature can complicate parsing as you'll need to resolve these references to find the true depth of the structure.\n\n4. Multi-line Strings: YAML supports multi-line strings which could be confused with nested objects if not correctly identified and handled.\n\n5. Inconsistent Indentation: Although YAML typically relies on indentation to denote structure, inconsistencies in indentation could lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the depth level.\n\n6. Implicit vs. Explicit Typing: YAML has implicit typing, which means it will try to determine the data type of a value automatically. However, this can lead to ambiguities when trying to interpret values that could be either a string or another data type.\n\nOnce you present the YAML file content, I will parse it and identify the most deeply nested objects that are neither lists nor dictionaries.
