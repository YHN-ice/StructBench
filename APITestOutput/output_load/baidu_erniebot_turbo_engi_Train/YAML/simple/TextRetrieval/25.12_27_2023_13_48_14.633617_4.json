Identifying the most deeply nested objects requires identifying where scalar values are located in the hierarchy.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors, which can create references to other parts of the document. This can make it difficult to identify the nesting level without resolving these references.\n\n4. **Consistent Indentation**: YAML relies on indentation to denote structure. Inconsistent or incorrect indentation can lead to parsing errors or misinterpretation of the hierarchy levels.\n\n5. **Distinguishing Between Lists and Dictionaries**: In YAML, lists and dictionaries are both considered collections but need to be differentiated to understand the nesting depth accurately.\n\n6. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents, separated by `---`.
