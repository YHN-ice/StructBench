Ambiguity in Structure: Sometimes, YAML files can have nested structures that can be complex to navigate if the relationships between objects are not clear.\n\n3. Large Files: If the YAML file is exceptionally large, it could be challenging to find the specific object efficiently without a way to search through the content.\n\n4. Multiple Objects with Same ID: If there are multiple objects with the same ID, it may be confusing to determine which one you are referring to without additional context.\n\n5. Non-Existent ID: If the given ID does not exist in the YAML file, it could lead to confusion and the inability to provide an excerpt.\n\n6. Special Characters and Encoding: YAML files can include special characters or use specific encoding, which might require proper handling during parsing to avoid data corruption or misinterpretation.\n\nTo circumvent these issues, ensure that the YAML file is well-structured, use efficient searching techniques for large files, clarify any ambiguities, handle special characters appropriately, and verify that the IDs are unique and exist within the file.
