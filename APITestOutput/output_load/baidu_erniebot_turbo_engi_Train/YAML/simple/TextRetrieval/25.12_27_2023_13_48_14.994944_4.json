Inconsistent indentation could create confusion in understanding nesting levels. This is another challenge because it can affect the parser's ability to correctly parse the structure of the YAML file.\n7. **Syntactical Errors**: If the YAML is not well-formed (e.g., missing colons, improper indentation), it could be challenging to parse.
