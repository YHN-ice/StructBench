It's important not to misinterpret the indentation levels as this could lead to incorrect identification of nesting levels.\n\n2. **Handling aliases and anchors**: YAML allows the definition of aliases and anchors which could lead to complex structures that are referenced multiple times. Understanding these references is crucial to accurately determine the nesting depth.\n\n3. **Scalar values vs. collection types**: We need to differentiate between scalar values (like strings, numbers, booleans) and collections (lists and dictionaries). The question specifies that list or dict types should not be considered.\n\n4. **Block style vs. Flow style**: YAML has two styles for writing collections – block style (using indentation) and flow style (using commas and braces). We need to handle both styles correctly.\n\n5. **Complex data types**: Custom tags and complex data types might be used in the YAML content which can complicate parsing.\n\n6. **Multi-line strings**: YAML supports multi-line strings.
