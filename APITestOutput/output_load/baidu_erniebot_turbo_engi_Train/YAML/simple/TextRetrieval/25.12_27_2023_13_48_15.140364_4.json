We need to distinguish between these when looking for the most deeply nested objects that are not lists or dictionaries.\n\n3. **Inline vs. Block Styles**: YAML syntax supports both inline and block styles for lists and dictionaries, which could affect parsing logic.\n\n4. **References & Anchors**: YAML allows defining anchors and using them as references elsewhere in the document, which can complicate determining the actual \"depth\" of an object.\n\n5. **Consistency**: The format must be consistent. Inconsistent indentation or formatting errors could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n6. **Scalar Content**: Determining whether content is scalar (i.e., a single value) or a collection (list or dict) can be tricky, especially when considering that scalars can span multiple lines.\n\n7. **Mixed Types in Lists**: Lists may contain both dictionaries and scalar values, requiring careful inspection to identify which list items are scalars.\n\n8. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. Each document must be parsed separately.\n\nConsidering these challenges, a robust parsing algorithm needs to correctly navigate the YAML structure, respecting its indentation-based hierarchy to identify the most deeply nested scalar objects.
