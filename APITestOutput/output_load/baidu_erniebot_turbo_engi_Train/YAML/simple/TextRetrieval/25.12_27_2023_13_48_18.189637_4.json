This can complicate the parsing process if one needs to keep track of referenced objects and their depths.\n\n3. **Inconsistent Indentation**: While YAML relies on indentation to denote structure, inconsistent indentation can lead to parsing errors or confusion about the hierarchy of elements.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Differentiating between strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, lists, and dictionaries can be tricky, especially if the content includes strings that look like other data types.\n\n5. **Differentiating Between Keys and Values**: In a deeply nested structure, it's important to correctly identify which are keys and which are values, especially when keys might have no value or a null value.\n\n6. **Multiple Documents**: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. Each document must be parsed separately.\n\n7. **Comments**: Comments need to be ignored during parsing as they are not part of the data structure.\n\n8. **Scalars, Blocks, and Literals**: YAML has multiple ways to represent scalars (simple values), including plain style, quoted style, block style, and literal style.
