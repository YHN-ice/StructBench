If the document is deeply nested or has a very complex structure, extracting the correct object might be challenging.\n\n3. **Syntax Errors**: If the YAML file has syntax errors, it might not be parsed correctly, leading to inaccurate or incomplete data extraction.\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be difficult to efficiently locate the specific object with id 'y'.\n\n5. **References & Aliases**: YAML supports references and aliases, where one part of the document can refer to another.
