        "As you have mentioned, there are some potential difficulties and obstacles to identifying the most deeply nested objects without being list or dict.

The root object (`id`) is not a list or a dictionary, so it's not included in the list of deeply nested objects.\n2. The `subs` key has a list value (`[]`). However, this list is not the most deeply nested object because it's not nested within any other object. It's only a direct child of the root object.\n3. The `subs` key has a dictionary value (`{X: i}`) at the second level. However, this dictionary is not the most deeply nested object because it's only nested within the `subs` list and not within any other object.\n4. The deepest nested object is the `subs` key at the third level, which has a nested dictionary value (`{id: \"s\", Y: j, subs: []}`). This dictionary is nested within the `subs` list and within the `id` object.\n\nTherefore, based on your provided criteria, the most deeply nested object that is not a list or a dictionary is `{id: \"s\", Y: j, subs: []}`.\n\nNote that I also identified the remaining objects in the YAML structure and confirmed that they are not lists or dictionaries. However, I only included the most deeply nested object in my answer for brevity. If you require further details or analysis of the remaining objects, please let me know."
