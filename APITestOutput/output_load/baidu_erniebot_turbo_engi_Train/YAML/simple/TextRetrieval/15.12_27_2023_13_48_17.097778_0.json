While parsing a YAML file, here are some potential difficulties and obstacles that might arise:\n\n1. **Complex Nesting**: YAML files can have multiple levels of nested objects and lists which can be challenging to navigate if you're looking for specific keys or values.\n   \n2. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors for duplicating or referencing content. If the object in question references other parts of the YAML file through these features, it can complicate the retrieval of that object's content.\n\n3. **Data Types**: YAML has implicit data typing, which can sometimes be misinterpreted. For example, a value that looks like a number could be interpreted as a string if it is not formatted correctly.\n\n4. **Formatting Issues**: YAML can be quite strict with indentation and formatting. If the file has any such issues, it could prevent proper parsing.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML is very large, it may be difficult to quickly find the object with the specific id without an efficient search mechanism.\n\n6. **Inheritance and Overrides**: Some YAML files might use inheritance-like patterns with overrides, where multiple objects define and redefine the same keys.\n\n7. **Special Characters**: Keys or values in YAML might contain special characters that need to be handled correctly, especially if they're used in identifiers like an `id`.\n\nTo accurately find and display the content of the object with id `l`, I would need the YAML input to parse it and provide you with the correct excerpt."
