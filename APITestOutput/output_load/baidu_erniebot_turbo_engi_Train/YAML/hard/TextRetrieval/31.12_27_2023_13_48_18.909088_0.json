For example, a string could be mistakenly interpreted as a number if not properly quoted.\n\n3. Aliases and Anchors: YAML allows for defining complex data structures using anchors (&) and aliases (*). Understanding and resolving these references is necessary for accurate interpretation.\n\n4. Multi-document Support: A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. Determining which document contains the object with id 'z' would be necessary.\n\n5. Special Characters: Handling special characters and understanding when they should be interpreted literally or as part of YAML syntax (like `!` for custom tags or `|` for block literals) is important.\n\n6.
