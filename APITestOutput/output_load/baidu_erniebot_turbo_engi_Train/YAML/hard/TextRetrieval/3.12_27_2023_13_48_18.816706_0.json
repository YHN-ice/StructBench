Properly resolving these references can be tricky.\n\n4. **Data Types**: Automatic type detection is a feature of YAML, and sometimes it may infer types incorrectly if the content is ambiguous. For example, a string that looks like a number could be wrongly interpreted as an integer or float.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is exceptionally large, it might be difficult to efficiently parse and find the relevant information without performance issues.\n\n6. **Variations in YAML Versions**: There are different versions of YAML, and each may have slightly different features or syntax. Ensuring compatibility with the specific version can be important.\n\n7. **Special Characters**: Handling special characters, such as quotation marks or newlines within strings, needs careful consideration to ensure they are parsed correctly.\n\n8. **Encoding**: The character encoding of the file needs to be correctly handled, especially if it includes non-ASCII characters.\n\n9. **Scalar Folding and Unfolding**: Multiline strings in YAML can be represented in different ways (`|` for literal block style, `>` for folded block style), which affects how the content is parsed and represented.\n\nOnce I receive the actual YAML input, I'll be able to parse it considering these potential issues and extract the required information about the object with id `p`."
