Syntax errors in the input file could cause parsing errors and make it difficult or impossible to extract the correct information.\n\n4. **Ambiguous Identifiers**: If the 'id' field is not uniquely identifying objects or if there are different kinds of identifiers used within the file, it may require additional logic to ensure the correct object is retrieved.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be resource-intensive to parse, and could potentially take a long time or exceed memory limits depending on the environment in which the parser is running.\n\n6. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types, and if the content associated with the 'id' is not in a simple string or object format, additional parsing rules may be necessary.\n\nOnce I have access to the actual YAML content, these challenges can be more specifically addressed.
