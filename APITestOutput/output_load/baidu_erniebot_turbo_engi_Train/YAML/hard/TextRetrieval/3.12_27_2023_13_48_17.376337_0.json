Improper formatting can lead to ambiguity in determining the structure and relationships within the file.\n\n5. **Aliases and References:** YAML supports the use of aliases and anchors which can create references to other parts of the document. This could complicate the retrieval of an object if it's not defined directly but rather referenced.\n\n6. **Variations in Data Types:** The values in YAML can be strings, numbers, lists, or other objects, which means I'll need to handle different data types when extracting the requested information.\n\nWith these potential difficulties in mind, I can proceed to parse the YAML file once it is provided, keeping an eye out for any of these issues that may arise."
