If the object with id \"cb\" is referenced elsewhere through an alias, it can be challenging to provide the full context of its definition without resolving these references.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it may take more time to parse, and finding the specific object could be time-consuming.\n\n6. **Encoding Issues**: The file may have encoding issues that prevent it from being read correctly.\n\n7. **Variations in Key Names**: If the key name for identifying objects isn't consistent (for example, using both 'id' and 'ID'), finding the correct object might require additional logic to handle these variations.\n\n8. **Data Types**: YAML supports various data types such as scalars, sequences, and mappings. Ensuring that data types are interpreted correctly is essential for accurate parsing.\n\n9. **Comments**: Comments in YAML start with `#`.
