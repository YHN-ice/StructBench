In such cases, it may be challenging to determine which object is being referred to.\n\n3. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML supports the use of anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) to reference other parts of the document. If the object with id 's' is referenced via an alias, it may not be immediately clear without resolving the alias to its corresponding anchor.\n\n4. **YAML Syntax**: Proper understanding of YAML syntax, such as indentation, is crucial for interpreting the contents. Incorrect indentation can change the meaning of the data structure.\n\n5. **Type Casting**: YAML automatically casts values to certain data types based on their syntax (e.g., true/false for booleans, numbers, etc.). Ensuring that ID values are interpreted correctly (as strings versus numbers) is important.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the input YAML file is very large, finding the specific object might be time-consuming or require efficient searching algorithms.\n\n7. **Inclusion of Other Files**: YAML supports the inclusion of content from other files using tags like `!include`. If an object is in an external file, it may not be visible in the main file without accessing the included file.\n\n8. **Comments**: Sometimes important information might be commented out, which can be confusing if not noticed.\n\n9. **File Read Errors**: There could be errors while reading the file due to encoding issues, corruption, or access permissions.\n\n10. **Parser Limitations**: Depending on the parser's capabilities, some advanced YAML features might not be supported or could be misinterpreted.\n\nThese obstacles will need to be addressed adequately to correctly answer questions about the contents of the YAML file.
