This can make it tricky to determine the actual \"deepest\" level without resolving these references.\n\n3. **Type ambiguity:** Without a schema, it can be difficult to determine the type of a value, especially if it's a string that looks like another data type (e.g., \"123\" vs. 123).\n\n4. **Block vs. Flow styles:** YAML allows for both block style (using indentation) and flow style (using brackets and commas).
