We need to determine which nodes are leaf nodes, as they contain the most deeply nested objects without further lists or dicts.\n\n3. **Maintaining Context**: As we navigate the nested structures, we must keep track of the context to ensure we can return the correct excerpt as it appears in the YAML file.\n\n4. **List vs. Dictionary Values**: YAML allows both lists and dictionaries as values for nested structures. We need to differentiate between these types to find values that are neither.\n\n5. **Type Determination**: While identifying the deeply nested objects, we must be able to determine the type of each value to ensure we only consider non-list and non-dict types.\n\n6. **Multiple Deeply Nested Objects**: There could be multiple deeply nested objects at the same level of nesting. We need to ensure we identify all of them.\n\n7. **Formatting and Indentation**: YAML's structure depends heavily on indentation. It's critical to preserve the correct indentation to provide an accurate excerpt from the file.\n\n8. **Variety of Data Types**: YAML supports various data types for values, including strings, numbers, booleans, etc. Any of these could be the values of our most deeply nested objects.\n\n9. **Aliases and References**: YAML supports referencing other parts of the file using anchors and aliases.
