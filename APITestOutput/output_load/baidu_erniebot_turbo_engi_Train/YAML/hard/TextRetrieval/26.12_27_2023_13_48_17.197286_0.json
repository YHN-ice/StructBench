Any inconsistencies in the formatting could make it difficult to identify the correct object or might lead to parsing errors.\n\n5. **Large File Size:** If the YAML file is very large, it might be challenging to locate the specific object without an efficient search or parsing strategy.\n\n6. **Id Representation:** Depending on how the id is represented (e.g., as a key, part of a list, or a value within another key), it may change how the search for the object with id 'w' is conducted.\n\n7. **Special Characters:** If the YAML file contains special characters or comments, they could potentially complicate the extraction of the required content.\n\n8. **Encoding and File Format Issues:** The file encoding or corruption could prevent proper parsing of the YAML content.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, I would need to methodically traverse the YAML structure, taking care to handle any complex features of the YAML format that are present in the file.
