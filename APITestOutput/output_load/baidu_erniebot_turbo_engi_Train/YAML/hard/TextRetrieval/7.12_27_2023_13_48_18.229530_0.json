Misinterpretation of the indentation or ignoring the importance of hyphens, colons, or other special characters may lead to incorrect parsing of the content.\n\n3. **References and Aliases:** YAML supports references (anchors and aliases), which allow for reuse of common settings or objects. Without proper handling, this could lead to confusion when identifying the content of an object.\n\n4. **Variations in Data Types:** YAML supports various data types like scalars, lists, and maps. Understanding the context and correctly identifying the type of data being queried is crucial.\n\n5. **Large Files:** If the YAML file is large, finding a specific object with a particular ID could be time-consuming without an efficient search mechanism.\n\n6. **Multiple Documents:** A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. Knowing which document contains the object with id 'n' might be necessary.\n\n7. **File Encoding and Character Sets:** If the file uses a non-standard encoding or character set, it could potentially lead to issues in interpreting the content correctly.\n\n8. **Updates to the YAML Specification:** If the file uses features from a newer version of the YAML specification that the parser may not support, this could result in an inability to parse the file correctly.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the parser needs to:\n- Carefully manage indentation levels and special characters.\n- Resolve references and aliases correctly.\n- Discriminate between different data types and understand their context.\n- Implement efficient searching mechanisms for large files or multiple documents.\n- Ensure compatibility with various file encodings and the latest YAML specifications.\n\nNow, please provide the YAML content so that I can assist you further in identifying the object with id 'n'."
