This can complicate the parsing as you need to handle each type differently.\n\n3. **Scalar Values vs. Empty Structures**: Deeply nested objects may contain scalar values (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans) or they may be empty dictionaries or lists. Identifying that a node is a scalar value and not just an empty structure is key.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: While YAML aims to be human-readable, it can be formatted in different ways (e.g., inline vs block), which might present challenges in consistently parsing the file.\n\n5. **Aliasing and Anchors**: YAML supports aliases and anchors which allows for referencing other parts of the YAML document. Resolving these references correctly is essential for understanding the actual structure.\n\n6. **Nodes with Only Attributes**: Some nodes may not contain any nested objects but only attributes. These nodes would represent leaf nodes in the hierarchy, but identifying them requires parsing the associated attributes correctly.\n\n7. **Implicit Types**: YAML has implicit typing, and if the parser is not careful, it might incorrectly interpret strings as other types (e.g., \"yes\" as a boolean).\n\nTo extract the most deeply nested objects that are neither lists nor dictionaries, the parser must traverse the hierarchical structure, keep track of the depth, and identify terminal nodes with scalar values.
