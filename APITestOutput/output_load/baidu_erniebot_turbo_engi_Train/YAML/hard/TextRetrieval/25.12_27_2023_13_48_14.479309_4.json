        "In your input YAML, there are multiple objects with varying levels of nesting. Here's a process that might help you identify the most deeply nested objects:\n\n1. **Identify the highest level of nesting:** At the top level, there are a few objects that do not have children. For example, `id: \"h\"` and `id: \"p\"`. You can ignore these at this stage.\n2. **Determine if an object has children or not:** Next, you need to check each object for whether it has children or not. Look for the presence of a key called `subs` or `sub` and if it is present, then that object has children.\n3. **Calculate the depth of nesting:** After you've identified all objects that have children, you can calculate the depth of nesting by counting the number of `subs` or `sub` keys that an object has.\n\n\n\t* If an object has multiple levels of nesting, keep counting until you reach an object that does not have children or reaches the end of the YAML file.\n\t* An object that has no value of type list or dict at any level is the most deeply nested object.\n\nLet's apply this process to your example:\n\n1. Highest level of nesting: The top level objects without children are `id: \"i\"` and `id: \"m\"`.\n2. Determine if an object has children or not:\n\n\n\t* Look for the keys `Y`, `X`, `W`, `V`, `U`, `T`, `R`, `Q`, `P`, `O`, and `subs` in the `subs` key of each object.\n\t* The objects with these keys are the ones that have children.\n3. Calculate the depth of nesting: The depth of nesting for each object can be calculated by counting the number of keys mentioned above. For example, the object with id \"m\" has 5 levels of nesting (`Y`, `X`, `W`, `R`, and 3 levels in its own `subs`).\n\nIn summary, the most deeply nested object in your YAML is the one without a value of type list or dict, which in this case is `id: \"i\"` because it has a single level of nesting and no value of type list or dict is present within it."
