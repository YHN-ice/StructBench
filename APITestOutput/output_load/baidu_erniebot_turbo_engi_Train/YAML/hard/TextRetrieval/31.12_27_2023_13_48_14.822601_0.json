If the object with id 'z' is referenced elsewhere via an anchor, it might require resolving these references to get the complete picture.\n\n4. **Multiple documents in one file:** A single YAML file can contain multiple documents separated by `---`. If the object with id 'z' is in a specific document, it's necessary to determine which one.\n\n5. **Syntactic errors:** If there are syntax errors in the YAML file, it could make parsing difficult or cause errors in interpretation.\n\n6. **Large files and performance:** If the YAML file is very large, it could pose performance issues for parsing and searching through the document.\n\n7. **Variants of YAML syntax:** There are different versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) and slight differences in how certain content might be represented or interpreted.\n\n8. **Encoding issues:** If the file has encoding issues or special characters, it could affect the parsing process.\n\nUnderstanding the exact structure and content of the YAML file will be essential in overcoming these potential obstacles.
