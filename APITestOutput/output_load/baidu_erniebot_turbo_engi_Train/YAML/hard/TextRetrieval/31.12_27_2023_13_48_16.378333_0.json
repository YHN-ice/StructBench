If the object with id 'z' uses these features, it could complicate extraction of just that object’s content.\n\n5. **Large File Size**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be resource-intensive to parse, and finding the object with id 'z' could take more time.\n\n6. **Encoding and Special Characters**: Special characters or encoding issues within the YAML file might cause parsing errors or incorrect interpretation of the content.\n\n7. **Version Specific Features**: YAML has different versions with slightly different features and syntax.
