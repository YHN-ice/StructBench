This means preserving the original formatting, including whitespace and indentation.\n\n4. **Multiple deepest objects:** There could be multiple objects at the same maximum depth level, and I need to return all of them, separated by a specified delimiter.\n\n5. **Syntactical correctness:** YAML is sensitive to syntax, especially indentation and colons.
