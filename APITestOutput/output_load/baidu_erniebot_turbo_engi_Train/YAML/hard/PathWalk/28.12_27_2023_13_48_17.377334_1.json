I would need to navigate through the hierarchy correctly.\n\n3. **Key naming**: If there are multiple lists or keys with similar names, it may take additional effort to identify the correct `subs` list you're referencing.\n\n4. **Aliases and anchors**: If the YAML file uses aliases and anchors, it could complicate the retrieval of values as I would have to resolve references correctly.\n\n5. **Large file size or complexity**: If the YAML file is very large or has a complex structure, it could take more time to parse and locate the specific information.\n\n6. **Variations in data types**: YAML supports various data types, and I need to ensure proper interpretation of these types when accessing the `id`.\n\n7. **File accessibility**: If there's an issue with accessing the file or if it's not provided, I won't be able to parse it and retrieve the necessary information.\n\nPlease provide the YAML content or further context so I can assist you with your query."
