If the document contains multiple instances of `subs`, this could lead to ambiguity.\n\n5. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it may take time to locate the correct section and parse it efficiently.\n\n6. **Variations in Key Names**: Sometimes, key names in YAML files may have variations due to case sensitivity or use of similar names (e.g., `ID`, `Id`, `id`). This could require additional logic to handle different cases.\n\nOnce you provide the YAML file content, I will be able to parse it and answer your question about the first object's `id` within the `subs` list."
