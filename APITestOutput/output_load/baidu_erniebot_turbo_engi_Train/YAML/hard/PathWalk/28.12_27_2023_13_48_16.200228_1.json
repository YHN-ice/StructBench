This feature allows for the reuse of elements in different parts of the document, which can complicate parsing if not handled properly.\n\n3. **Data Types**: Ensuring that data types are correctly interpreted (e.g., strings vs. integers) is important, especially since the \"id\" is likely an integer or a string that represents an integer.\n\n4. **Indistinct Keys**: If there are multiple keys named \"subs\" at different levels of the document, it might be confusing to determine which one is being referred to without additional context.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: YAML is whitespace-sensitive and relies on indentation for structure.
