        "To find the first object's id of the 'subs' property, you can use a YAML parser like PyYAML. Here's an example code in Python that demonstrates how to parse the YAML file and retrieve the first object's id:\n\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\n# Read the YAML file\nwith open('your_yaml_file.yaml', 'r') as file:\n    data = yaml.safe_load(file)\n\n# Find the first object in 'subs'\nfirst_object = next(obj for obj in data['subs'] if 'id' in obj)\n\n# Print the 'id' of the first object\nprint(first_object['id'])\n```\nPlease replace `'your_yaml_file.yaml'` with the actual path to your YAML file. The code assumes that the file is formatted correctly and contains the nested structure you provided. It iterates through the 'subs' property and retrieves the first object with an 'id' key, then prints its 'id'.\n\nMake sure to install PyYAML using `pip install pyyaml` before running the code. If you encounter any issues, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you further."
