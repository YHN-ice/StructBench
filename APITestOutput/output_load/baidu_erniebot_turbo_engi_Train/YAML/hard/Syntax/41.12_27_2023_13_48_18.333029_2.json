When parsing a YAML file, some common structural errors that could occur include:\n\n1. **Indentation Errors**: YAML uses indentation to denote structure; however, tabs are not allowed – spaces are used instead. The number of spaces used to indent sections must be consistent throughout the document.\n\n2. **Key-Value Pair Issues**: A colon followed by a space is used to separate keys from values. Omitting the space or the colon can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Sequence/List Errors**: Lists are denoted with a hyphen followed by a space. Items in a list must be at the same indentation level.\n\n4. **Mapping/Nested Object Errors**: Like lists, nested objects must maintain consistent indentation to show hierarchy.\n\n5. **Duplicate Keys**: In a map, keys must be unique. Duplicate keys can cause undefined behavior or errors.\n\n6. **Incorrect Use of Quotes**: While YAML often doesn't require quotes, they are used to include special characters or to force string interpretation. Incorrect quoting can cause errors.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors**: This can include improper use of anchors and aliases, incorrect use of literal or folded block scalars (indicated with `|` or `>`), etc.\n\n8. **Document Markers**: The beginning of a document is sometimes marked with `---`, and the end with `...`, but these are not always required and must be used correctly if present.\n\nWhen parsing a YAML file, the parser should report on these common types of errors if any are found.
