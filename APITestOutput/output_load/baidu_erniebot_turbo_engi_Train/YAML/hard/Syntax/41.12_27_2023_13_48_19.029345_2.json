Lists should be preceded by dashes (-) and dictionaries follow a key-value structure with a colon (:).\n\n5. **Scalars, Blocks, and Flow Collections**: Scalars need to be correctly identified, block sequences should be properly indented, and flow collections (enclosed in curly braces `{}` or square brackets `[]`) must be correctly used.\n\n6. **Anchors and Aliases**: YAML allows for the definition of anchors and the use of aliases to repeat content, which, if incorrectly defined or used, could cause issues.\n\n7. **Tags and Directives**: Custom tags or directives at the beginning of the document could be incorrectly formatted.\n\n8. **Comments**: While comments (beginning with `#`) should not affect the structure, improper use could lead to confusion or misinterpretation.\n\n9. **Compatibility and Extensions**: YAML has different versions and extensions that may not be supported by all parsers, potentially causing compatibility issues.\n\n10. **Encoding**: YAML should be encoded in UTF-8 without BOM.
