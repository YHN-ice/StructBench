Mixing them can cause errors.\n\n3. **Incorrect Data Types**: Mismatch between expected data types (such as a string instead of an integer) can lead to errors.\n\n4. **Improper Key-Value Pairs**: Every key must have a corresponding value, which can be null. If this structure is not adhered to, it can cause parsing errors.\n\n5. **Duplicated Keys**: Keys within the same map must be unique. If duplicated, it leads to undefined behavior or error.\n\n6. **Syntax Errors**: This includes incorrect use of characters or structures like missing colons separating keys from values, wrong use of quotes for strings, etc.\n\n7. **Complex Structures**: YAML supports complex structures like lists, nested objects, etc., and errors can occur when these are not correctly represented.\n\n8. **Special Characters**: Special characters in strings may need to be escaped, depending on the context.\n\n9. **Document Start and End Indicators**: The optional document start (`---`) and end (`...`) indicators must be used correctly if present.\n\n10. **Directives and Tags**: If YAML directives or tags are used, they must adhere to the correct syntax.\n\nIf any of these issues are present in the YAML content provided, it would indicate a structural error in the YAML file."
