Improper key-value pairs: Keys and values are separated by a colon followed by a space. Missing colons or spaces can cause errors.\n\n3. Dashes used for lists: When defining a list, each item must be preceded by a dash and a space. Omitting the dash or space can lead to errors.\n\n4.

For example, a list within a mapping must be indented correctly relative to its key.\n\n5.
