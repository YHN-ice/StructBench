Incorrect Data Types: Sometimes, the data types may not be correctly defined, e.g., a string that should be an integer or vice versa.\n\n4. Inconsistent List Formatting: Lists in YAML need to be consistently formatted, either with a dash and space ('- ') for each element or using inline style with square brackets.\n\n5. Duplicate Keys: In a YAML mapping, keys must be unique; otherwise, it can lead to undefined behavior.\n\n6. Missing Colons or Incorrect Use of Dashes: A missing colon after a key or incorrect usage of dashes can lead to errors in interpreting the document.\n\n7.
