Each nesting level should be consistently indented using spaces (not tabs). Inconsistent indentation can lead to parsing errors.\n\n2. **Key-Value Pairs:** Keys should be unique within a map, and key-value pairs should be separated by a colon followed by a space.\n\n3. **Lists:** Items in lists should be preceded by a hyphen and a space. Indentation is important for list items as well.\n\n4. **Data Types:** Strings, numbers, and booleans should be formatted correctly. Strings, especially those containing special characters, may need to be quoted.\n\n5. **Complex Structures:** When using nested maps or lists, it's crucial to maintain the proper indentation and structure to ensure that the elements are parsed correctly.\n\n6. **Flow Style vs Block Style:** YAML allows for both flow style (inline) and block style. Ensure that the chosen style is used consistently and correctly.\n\n7. **Anchors and Aliases:** If used, anchors (`&`) should be defined before aliases (`*`) reference them.\n\n8. **Comments:** Comments should begin with a `#`, and anything following the `#` on a line will be treated as a comment.\n\n9. **Multiline Strings:** Proper syntax must be used for multiline strings, whether it's with folding style (`>`) or literal style (`|`).\n\n10. **Directives and Reserved Indicators:** Directives (`%`) and reserved indicators (`---` for document start, `...` for document end) should be used correctly.\n\nNow you may provide the YAML file content for me to check for structural errors."
