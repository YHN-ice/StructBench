If a file contains tabs, it will result in an error.\n\n3. **Data Types Confusion**: YAML has implicit type casting based on the content, which can sometimes lead to confusion if the data does not conform to the expected types, such as confusing strings with numbers or booleans.\n\n4. **Special Characters**: Special characters in strings might need to be escaped, or strings should be quoted to avoid being misconstrued as other data types or structures.\n\n5. **Sequences and Mappings**: Incorrectly formatted lists (sequences) or dictionaries (mappings) can cause errors. Items in a list must be preceded by a dash and a space, while key-value pairs in mappings must be separated by a colon and a space.\n\n6. **Complex Data Structures**: Nested structures can sometimes be difficult to interpret correctly, especially if they are not well-indented or if there's a mix-up between lists and dictionaries.\n\n7. **Anchors and Aliases**: YAML supports the use of anchors and aliases to repeat content, but these must be defined correctly, otherwise, they can cause errors.\n\n8. **Directives and Reserved Keywords**: YAML has certain reserved keywords and directives that must be used correctly; misuse can lead to parsing issues.\n\nKeep these potential issues in mind when examining the YAML file for structural errors."
