Each level of indentation typically consists of two or four spaces. A common error is inconsistent or incorrect indentation which can lead to parsing errors.\n\n2. **Incorrect use of dashes and colons**: Collections in YAML are defined with dashes (`-`) for lists and colons (`:`) for key-value pairs. Missing or extra dashes and colons can lead to structural issues.\n\n3. **Tabs instead of spaces**: The YAML specification requires spaces for indentation, not tabs. If a YAML file contains tabs for indentation, this will be an error.\n\n4. **Unquoted strings with special characters**: In YAML, certain characters have special meanings and need to be escaped or quoted. If these characters are present in strings without proper quoting, it can result in errors.\n\n5. **Mapping values are not allowed here**: This error occurs when you place a key-value pair (mapping value) in a context where only items of a sequence (list) should appear.\n\n6. **Duplicate keys**: Each key in a YAML map must be unique. Duplicate keys are an error.\n\n7. **Sequences/mappings not allowed**: This happens when you incorrectly nest a sequence (list) or mapping (dictionary) inside another element where it's not allowed.\n\n8. **Scalar values not allowed**: This error can occur when you provide a scalar value (like a string or number) in a place where the structure expects a list or dictionary.\n\n9. **Missing or superfluous commas/brackets**: While YAML does not typically use commas or brackets, if it is written in JSON-like format which YAML supports, incorrect use of these characters can lead to errors.\n\nIf the provided YAML file contains any of these structural issues, it would be considered erroneous.
