Missing colons or spaces can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Sequences and Mappings**: Lists (sequences) are denoted by dashes, and each new element should be on a new line with the same level of indentation. Mappings (dictionaries or objects) involve key-value pairs.\n\n4. **Scalars, Blocks, and Flow Styles**: Scalars (single values) are straightforward, but block styles (using `|` or `>`) for multiline strings and flow styles (using `[ ]` for lists and `{ }` for maps) have their own rules that need to be followed.\n\n5. **Complex Structures**: Nested structures must maintain proper indentation and correct use of sequences and mappings.\n\n6. **Duplicate Keys**: Keys within the same map should be unique.\n\n7. **Special Characters**: Certain characters have special meanings and may need to be quoted or escaped, for example, `:`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `,`, and `#`.\n\n8. **Document Start and End Indicators**: While not always required, documents can start with `---` and end with `...`.\n\n9. **Tab Characters**: YAML does not permit tabs for indentation, only spaces.\n\n10. **Incorrect Data Types**: For example, placing a string value without quotes when it could be confused with a boolean or number might cause issues.\n\nThese are some common issues to look out for when examining a YAML file for structural errors.
