Missing or incorrectly placed colons or dashes can cause errors.\n\n4. **Improper handling of special characters or strings**: Special characters may need to be escaped, and strings sometimes need to be quoted.\n\n5. **Use of tabs instead of spaces**: YAML does not allow tabs for indentation; only spaces are permitted.\n\n6. **Ambiguous values**: Certain strings can be interpreted in various ways, potentially leading to confusion about a value's intended type.\n\n7. **Duplicate keys**: In a map, each key should be unique; duplicate keys might cause unexpected behavior.\n\n8. **Sequence/item alignment**: Items in a sequence need to be properly aligned with the correct level of indentation.\n\n9. **Nested structures complexity**: Deeply nested structures can be hard to follow and might lead to errors if not carefully written and reviewed.\n\n10. **Compatibility with different versions of YAML (1.1 vs 1.2)**: Some syntax that is valid in one version of YAML may not be valid in another, which can lead to errors if the parser expects a different version than the one used to write the YAML document.\n\nTo evaluate whether the YAML file is free from structural errors, it's important to carefully review its contents according to these points and ensure that it adheres to YAML syntax rules.
