Inconsistent use of tabs and spaces: YAML does not support tabs for indentation; only spaces are allowed. Mixing tabs and spaces can cause errors.\n\n3. Incorrect data types: Mistakes in specifying data types (such as not quoting strings that resemble booleans or numbers) can lead to errors.\n\n4. Improper handling of special characters: Special characters in strings may need to be escaped or quoted to be interpreted correctly.\n\n5. Duplicated keys: In a YAML file, keys must be unique within a map. Duplicate keys can lead to undefined behavior.\n\n6. Missing or extra colons/spaces: Colons and spaces are used to separate keys from values, and their proper placement is crucial.\n\n7. Sequences and mappings issues: Errors can occur if there are issues in the way lists (sequences) and dictionaries (mappings) are defined.\n\n8.
