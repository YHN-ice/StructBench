Incorrect indentation can lead to misinterpreted hierarchy or syntax errors.\n\n2. **Tabs vs Spaces:** YAML requires that spaces are used for indentation, not tabs.\n\n3. **Key-Value Pairs:** In YAML, key-value pairs should be separated by a colon followed by a space.\n\n4. **Dashes for Lists:** When representing lists, items should be preceded by a dash (and a space).\n\n5. **Data Types:** YAML automatically detects data types (strings, numbers, Booleans, etc.), but sometimes there may be a need to explicitly specify the type (e.g., strings that look like Booleans or numbers).\n\n6. **Multiline Strings:** There are specific ways to represent multiline strings that need to be followed.\n\n7. **Duplicate Keys:** Every key in a YAML file must be unique within its scope.\n\n8. **Flow Style vs Block Style:** YAML allows both flow style (using commas and brackets) and block style (using indentation). Mixing styles improperly can cause errors.\n\n9. **Anchors and Aliases:** YAML supports anchors and aliases to avoid repetition, but they must be used correctly to maintain proper references.\n\n10. **Comments:** Comments in YAML start with `#` and must not interfere with the actual configuration data.\n\nOnce the YAML content is provided, it is necessary to check against these rules to determine if there is any structural error in the YAML data."
