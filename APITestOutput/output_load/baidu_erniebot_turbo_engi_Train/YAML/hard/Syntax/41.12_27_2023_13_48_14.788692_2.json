Sequences start with a dash and space (\"- \"), and mappings use a colon and space to separate keys from values (\"key: value\").\n- Scalars not being handled properly: Scalars (single values) need to be treated correctly, especially if they contain characters that might be interpreted as part of YAML syntax (e.g., colons, dashes, brackets). These may need to be quoted or escaped.\n- Mixing tabs and spaces: Tabs are not allowed in YAML; spaces must be used for indentation.\n- Duplicated keys within a mapping: Each key within a mapping must be unique.\n\nThese are examples of potential structural issues in a YAML file.
