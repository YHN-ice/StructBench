Duplicate Keys: YAML does not allow for duplicate keys within the same map; this would cause a structural error.\n\n5. Invalid Characters: Some characters may need to be escaped or quoted to be parsed correctly.\n\n6. Mapping and Sequences Errors: Confusion between mappings (key-value pairs) and sequences (lists) could lead to structural problems.\n\n7. Document Start and End Indicators: The use of `---` to indicate the start of a document and `...` to mark its end could be omitted or misplaced, potentially leading to parsing issues.\n\n8.
