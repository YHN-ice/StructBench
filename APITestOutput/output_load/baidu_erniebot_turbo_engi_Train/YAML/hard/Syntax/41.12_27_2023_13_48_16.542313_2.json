For example, a string that looks like a boolean (`yes`, `no`, `true`, `false`) or number but is meant to be a string without quotes around it.\n\n5. **Syntax Errors**: Syntax issues such as missing quotes for strings that contain special characters, improper use of anchors and aliases, or incorrect multiline string formatting.\n\n6. **Duplicate Keys**: In YAML, keys within the same map must be unique; duplicate keys are often considered an error.\n\n7. **Compatibility Issues**: There may be features that are specific to certain versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1 vs 1.2) and not supported in others.\n\n8. **Complex Structures**: Complex nested structures might be misinterpreted if not properly aligned or if the relationship between elements is not clear.\n\nTo determine if the given YAML file contains structural errors, I will need to see the actual content of the YAML file."
