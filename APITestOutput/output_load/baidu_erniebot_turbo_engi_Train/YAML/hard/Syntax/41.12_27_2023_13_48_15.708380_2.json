A common error is using tabs instead of spaces.\n\n7. **Flow Styles**: Incorrect use of flow styles (inline collections) with brackets `[]` for lists and braces `{}` for maps.\n\n8. **Anchors and Aliases**: Errors can occur when defining or using anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) improperly.\n\n9. **Comments**: Incorrect usage of comments (starting with `#`) can sometimes cause issues if they're not placed correctly.\n\n10. **Document Start and End Indicators**: Errors with document start `---` and end `...` indicators can lead to parsing issues, though these are optional in most cases.\n\n11. **Encoding Issues**: Non-UTF-8 encoding may cause unexpected behavior when parsing.\n\n12. **Compatibility**: Differences in YAML versions (1.1 vs 1.2) may lead to different interpretations of certain features.\n\nTo accurately determine if there is a structural error in a YAML file, the parser needs to systematically check for these potential issues.
