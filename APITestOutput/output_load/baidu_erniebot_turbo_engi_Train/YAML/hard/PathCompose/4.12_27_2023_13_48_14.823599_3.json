Accessing an element within a sequence requires an index, while accessing values in a mapping requires the corresponding key. Identifying whether to use a key or an index at each level is essential.\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors:** YAML files may use aliases and anchors to reference previously defined items. Understanding these references is crucial to access the correct value.\n\n5. **Implicit Data Types:** YAML parsers typically convert values to their implicit data types (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans). This can sometimes lead to confusion if the data type of a value is not what's expected.\n\n6. **YAML Version:** The features and syntax can vary slightly between different versions of YAML (e.g., 1.1 vs 1.2).
