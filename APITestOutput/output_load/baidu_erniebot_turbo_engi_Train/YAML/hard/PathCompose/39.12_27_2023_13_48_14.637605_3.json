Ensure you use the exact key name when trying to access the value.\n\n3. **Data types**: YAML supports various data types like scalars, lists, and maps. You need to know what type of element you're dealing with to access it appropriately (e.g., using an index for lists or a key for maps).\n\n4. **Aliases and Anchors**: YAML allows defining aliases with the `&` anchor notation, which can then be referenced elsewhere in the document with `*`. This can complicate direct access without knowing the full structure.\n\n5. **Complex Data Structures**: If the file includes complex data structures like nested lists within maps or vice versa, you'll need to carefully navigate through multiple layers to get to the desired value.\n\n6. **Variations in Syntax**: There might be different ways to write similar structures in YAML (e.g., block style vs. flow style), which could affect how you parse and access data.\n\n7. **Inherited properties**: If using a tool that supports YAML inheritance or extensions, some properties might not be explicitly defined in the section you're looking at but inherited from elsewhere.\n\nWithout seeing the specific YAML input, these are generic issues one should keep in mind.
