The code assumes that the YAML file is in a dictionary format, and the values you are interested in are nested within the provided structure. It then traverses through the nested keys and indexes to reach the desired value \"h\".\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the YAML file is properly formatted and the provided structure accurately represents the data. If there are any mistakes or issues with the file, such as syntax errors or incorrect indentation, this approach may not work as expected.
