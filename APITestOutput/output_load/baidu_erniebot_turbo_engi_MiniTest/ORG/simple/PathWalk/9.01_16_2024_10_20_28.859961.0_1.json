Extracting plain text while preserving meaningful formatting could be complex.\n\n5. **Text Encoding**: If the ORG file uses a text encoding that is not properly handled, characters may not be read correctly.\n\n6. **File Size and Memory Constraints**: If the ORG file is particularly large, it might pose memory constraints or performance issues for the parser.\n\n7. **Error Handling**: The parser needs to handle corrupted or malformed parts of the file gracefully without crashing or producing incorrect output.\n\n8. **Distinguishing Content from Comments**: ORG files allow comments, and a parser must distinguish between actual content and commented-out sections.\n\nFor me to provide an accurate excerpt from a specific section of an ORG file, I'll need to process the input file structure precisely to extract the content while dealing with the aforementioned potential difficulties.
