Identifying image links: ORG files can include images using a variety of syntaxes. An image may be linked directly or may be embedded within other markup. Recognizing all possible ways images can be included will be essential.\n\n2. File path variations: The path to the image file could be an absolute path, a relative path, or even a URL. Handling these different scenarios consistently will be necessary to extract the image file names correctly.\n\n3. Different image formats: Images can come in various formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.). The parser must recognize all relevant image file extensions.\n\n4. Inline images vs attachments: Images might be included inline within text or as attachments. The parser must differentiate between these cases if necessary.\n\n5. Syntax variations: ORG files can have variations in syntax, such as different ways to denote links or images, which might affect the ability to accurately identify image files.\n\n6. Multiline links: Sometimes, a link to an image might be broken up across multiple lines. The parser will need to account for this possibility and still extract the full path to the image.\n\n7. Non-standard markup: Users might have used non-standard or custom markup to include images, which could complicate the extraction process.\n\n8. Encrypted content: If the ORG file contains encrypted sections, and images are within these sections, it would not be possible to extract the image file names without decryption.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll be better able to address these potential issues and extract the names of the included image files accordingly."
