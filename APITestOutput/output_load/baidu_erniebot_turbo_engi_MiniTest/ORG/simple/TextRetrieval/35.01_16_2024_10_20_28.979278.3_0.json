However, if there are inconsistencies or variations in formatting, this could pose a challenge.\n\n2. **Complex Markup:** ORG files can contain complex markup with various levels of nesting. If bold text appears within other markup elements (e.g., within a link description or a footnote), it may require more sophisticated parsing to accurately extract the bold text without bringing along unwanted elements.\n\n3. **Escape Characters:** Sometimes, markup characters are escaped to display literally rather than as formatting (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*` vs. `*bold*`). Properly distinguishing between escaped and non-escaped markup is necessary to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Non-standard Extensions:** Users might use non-standard extensions or configurations that alter the default markup for bold text, which would require custom parsing logic.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Malformed Markup:** If the ORG file has incomplete or malformed markup (e.g., a missing closing `*`), it could lead to incorrect extraction of bold texts.\n\nWe would need to consider these potential difficulties and apply appropriate parsing techniques to accurately extract all bold texts from the input ORG file.
