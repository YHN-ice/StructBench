However, the number of asterisks and their placement could vary, making it tricky to determine if the text is meant to be bold or if asterisks are used for other purposes like headings.\n\n2. **Embedded Formatting**: Bold text could be part of a larger formatted section, such as a list, table, or hyperlink. This requires the parser to understand the context and not just look for asterisks.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters**: Users might escape asterisks (e.g., `\\*not bold\\*`) to display them as literal characters rather than formatting, which the parser needs to recognize to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Multiline Bold Text**: Bold formatting could span multiple lines, and the parser would have to handle line breaks within bold sections correctly.\n\n5. **Nested Formatting**: Bold text could contain other formatting inside it, like italics or code snippets. The parser needs to distinguish these and decide whether to extract just the bold text or include the nested formatting.\n\n6. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Users might not follow strict formatting rules, leading to inconsistencies like unmatched asterisks or mixed use of markup styles, complicating the extraction process.\n\nOnce the input file is provided, we can address these challenges specifically by examining the actual bold text markup used within the file."
