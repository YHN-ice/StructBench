Hierarchical Structure: ORG files have a hierarchical structure based on headlines and subheadlines, which are denoted by asterisks (*).

This notation is not standard and can be confusing. It may be intended to refer to the first subsection under the second section. Clarity on section and subsection counting is essential.\n\n3. Nested Content: ORG files can contain nested subsections, lists, tables, and other elements. Determining which content falls under the requested subsection without including unrelated material is important.\n\n4. Formatting: ORG files support various formatting options, such as bold, italic, underlined text, links, and more. Properly parsing and displaying these formatting options while maintaining the excerpt's integrity could be challenging.\n\n5. Large Files: If the ORG file is particularly large, efficiently locating the specific section without performance issues might be a concern.\n\n6. Incomplete or Incorrect Input: If the ORG file is incomplete or does not adhere to standard formatting conventions, it could lead to incorrect parsing and an inaccurate answer.\n\n7. External References: ORG files may contain links or references to external sources, which might not be accessible or relevant to the question asked.\n\n8.
