Identifying image syntax: ORG files may use different syntaxes to include images. Commonly, images are included with a link syntax like `[[file:image_name.jpg]]`. However, variations and shorthand notations may exist and need to be accounted for.\n\n2. Filtering out non-image links: An ORG file can contain various types of links, not just those to image files. The parser will need to distinguish between image file links and other links.\n\n3. Relative vs. absolute paths: Image file paths in an ORG file could be relative to the file's location or absolute paths. The parser needs to handle both types of paths effectively.\n\n4. Multiple occurrences: The same image file might be included multiple times in the document. Deciding whether to list duplicates or to filter them out is necessary.\n\n5. File extensions: There are several file extensions for images (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.). The parser needs to recognize all the possible image file extensions.\n\n6. Incomplete or broken image links: Sometimes, links might be incomplete or broken within the document, leading to potential errors during parsing.\n\n7. Nested structures: Images might be included within other structures like lists, tables, or nested blocks, which can complicate the parsing logic.\n\n8. Handling inline images: Some ORG files may include images inline using specific syntax or markup tags that differ from the standard link format.\n\n9. Different formatting styles: Users might have customized their ORG files with different formats or conventions for including images, which the parser must be adaptable to recognize.\n\n10. Embedded code or macros: If an ORG file contains embedded code or macros that dynamically generate image links, static parsing might not capture these images without executing the code.\n\nUnderstanding these challenges can help in creating a robust parsing strategy that can reliably extract image filenames from an ORG file."
