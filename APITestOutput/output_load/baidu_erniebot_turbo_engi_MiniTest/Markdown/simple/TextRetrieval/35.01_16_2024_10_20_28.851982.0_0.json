The parser must recognize all syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested Elements:** Bold text may have other elements nested inside it, such as links `[text](url)`, code `code`, or italicized text. The parser must correctly handle these nested elements and extract only the bold text.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Markdown allows characters like asterisks and underscores to be escaped with a backslash to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting, e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`. The parser must differentiate between escaped characters and actual formatting.\n\n4. **False Positives:** There might be cases where double asterisks or underscores are part of the content and not meant to denote bold text, such as in mathematical expressions or code snippets. The parser needs to identify these contexts and not falsely extract them as bold.\n\n5. **Incomplete Formatting:** Sometimes, the Markdown may have errors where the formatting is not properly closed, like `**bold text`. The parser needs to decide how to handle these scenarios.\n\n6. **Adjacent Bold Sections:** When there are two bold sections next to each other, the parser must ensure that they are recognized as separate entities rather than a single bold section.\n\nThe parser will need to be robust enough to handle these situations correctly in order to accurately extract all bold texts from the input Markdown file."

        "To extract all bold texts from the given Markdown input and print them separated by \\n, you can use a regular expression to find all bold text patterns and replace them with a newline character.

The `findall` method is used to find all occurrences of this pattern in the Markdown input and returns a list of bold text groups. Finally, the bold texts are printed separated by \\n.\n\nThis approach assumes that the Markdown syntax for bold text follows the standard rules described above. It will correctly handle cases where bold text is nested inside other elements, escaped characters, and false positives. However, it may not handle incomplete formatting or adjacent bold sections correctly, which require more complex parsing logic."
