Both double asterisks and double underscores are commonly used. The parser must recognize all valid syntax variations.\n\n2. **Nested Emphasis:** Bold text might have nested emphasis like italic or strikethrough within it (e.g., `**bold _italic_**`). The parser should correctly extract the bold text while accounting for or ignoring nested emphasis based on the requirement.\n\n3. **Escaped Characters:** Markdown allows characters like asterisks and underscores to be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\**not bold\\**`). The parser will need to differentiate between actual bold syntax and escaped characters that are not meant to denote bold text.\n\n4. **Incorrect Formatting:** Users may make mistakes in their Markdown formatting (e.g., `**bold text*` with uneven asterisks). The parser should decide whether to be strict and ignore such errors or to try and recover the intended formatting.\n\n5. **Code Blocks and Inline Code:** Text within code blocks (fenced by triple backticks ` ``` ` or indented with four spaces) or inline code (surrounded by single backticks ` `code` `) should not be parsed as bold since they are meant to represent code snippets.\n\n6. **Links and Images:** Bold syntax within link text or image alt text needs to be considered. For example, `![**alt text**](image_url)` has bold text within the alt text of an image.\n\n7. **Line Breaks and Paragraphs:** Bold text might span across multiple lines or paragraphs, which could complicate extraction if the parser is line-based.\n\n8. **Performance on Large Files:** If the Markdown file is large, performance considerations may come into play for real-time parsing applications.\n\nGiven these potential difficulties, the parser needs to be well-designed to handle a wide range of valid and potentially invalid Markdown scenarios to extract bold texts accurately."

        "To extract all bold texts from the given Markdown input and print them separated by \\n, you can use a parser that is specifically designed for Markdown. Here's an example in Python using the `markdown` library:\n\n\n```python\nfrom markdown import markdown\n\ndef extract_bold_texts(input_string):\n    # Convert Markdown to HTML and remove extra newlines\n    html = markdown(input_string, extensions=['fenced_code', 'codehilite'])\n    stripped_html = html.replace('\\n\\n', '\\n')\n\n    # Extract bold text using a regular expression\n    bold_texts = []\n    for match in re.finditer(r'(\\*\\*[^\\*\\s]+?\\*\\*)', stripped_html):\n        bold_texts.append(match.group(1))\n\n    return bold_texts\n\ninput_string = \"\"\"\nd\nessence qua**halo**lify unique X-ray X-ray kangaroo\n# e\nfar qualify unique X-ray X-ray kangar**idiot**oo\n## f\ngroot qualify uniq![alt](ne.jpg \"hover text\")ue X-ray X-ray kangaroo\n\"\"\"\n\nbold_texts = extract_bold_texts(input_string)\nfor text in bold_texts:\n    print(text)\n```\nThis code converts the Markdown input to HTML using the `markdown` library, and then extracts bold text using a regular expression. The regular expression matches any sequences of three or more asterisks followed by any characters, followed by three or more asterisks again. This should match all valid bold text syntaxes, including those with nested emphasis or escaped characters.\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the Markdown input is well-formed and follows the expected syntax. It may not handle all invalid or unexpected Markdown formatting perfectly, but it should be a good starting point for most use cases. If you encounter any issues with this approach, you can adjust the regular expression or use a more advanced parser library like `Mistune` or `commonmark`."
