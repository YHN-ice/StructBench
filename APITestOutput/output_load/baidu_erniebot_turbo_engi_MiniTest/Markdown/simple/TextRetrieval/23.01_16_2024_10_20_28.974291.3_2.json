The most common one is `![Alt text](URL)`, but there could be variations or additional parameters, such as title text after the URL, or reference-style links where the URL is not inline with the tag.\n\n2. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Image paths can be either relative to the Markdown file's location or absolute URLs (including HTTP URLs). Depending on the requirement, we might need to differentiate between them or handle them accordingly.\n\n3. **Embedded HTML**: Sometimes, images are embedded using raw HTML tags within Markdown files. We'll need to consider whether to parse `<img>` tags as well.\n\n4. **Encoded URLs**: URLs might be percent-encoded, especially if they contain spaces or special characters.\n\n5. **Non-image File URLs**: The Markdown might contain links to non-image files that we need to ignore if the task is specifically to extract image files.\n\n6. **Escaped Characters**: If any special characters in Markdown syntax are escaped (such as `\\!`), they should not be treated as actual image syntax.\n\n7. **Comments or Disabled Links**: The Markdown could include comments or purposely disabled links that should not be counted as actual images.\n\n8. **Multiline Syntax**: The possibility that image syntax is split across multiple lines, which might make simple line-by-line parsing ineffective.\n\n9. **False Positives**: Text that looks like an image link but isn't actually one (e.g., code blocks, quoted text).\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, our parser will need to be able to accurately identify the image syntax despite these potential complexities and extract just the filenames from the valid image links."
