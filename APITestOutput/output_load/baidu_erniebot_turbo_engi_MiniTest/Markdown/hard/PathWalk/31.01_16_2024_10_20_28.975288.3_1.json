The parser must correctly interpret these heading levels to determine the hierarchy.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: If the Markdown file has inconsistent formatting or does not adhere to common Markdown conventions, it might be difficult to parse the headings and content accurately.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Complex Content**: The content of the specified subsection may include various elements such as code blocks, lists, images, links, or other embedded Markdown features that need to be correctly handled and included in the excerpt.\n\n6. **Large Files**: If the Markdown file is very large, it may be challenging to efficiently locate the specific subsection without an efficient searching algorithm or strategy.\n\nTo avoid these issues, it's essential that the parser is designed to handle a variety of Markdown structures and formatting intricacies, and that it has clear instructions for interpreting section and subsection numbering and hierarchy."
