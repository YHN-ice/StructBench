Nested Structures: JSON files can contain nested objects and arrays, which might require multiple levels of key/index access. Navigating through the correct path can be tricky if the structure is complex.\n\n2. Key Names: JSON keys are case-sensitive, so it's important to use the exact key names including the correct case to access the desired data.\n\n3. Syntax Errors: While forming the access path, one might encounter syntax errors or typos. Proper syntax needs to be followed, including the usage of quotes around string keys and brackets for indices.\n\n4. Dynamic Data: If the structure of the JSON file is dynamic and changes, a hardcoded path may not work consistently to access data. This can be a significant obstacle if the file's structure is not predictable.\n\n5. Arrays vs Objects: Determining whether a given level in the JSON hierarchy is an array or an object is essential because it affects whether you use an index (for arrays) or a key (for objects).\n\n6. Type Checking: Ensuring that the accessed entities are of the expected data type (e.g., string, number, object, array) is important to avoid runtime errors.\n\n7. Null or Undefined Values: Encountering null or undefined values along the access path can lead to errors if not handled properly.\n\n8. Data Integrity: The JSON file could have missing or incomplete data which might lead to errors when attempting to access certain keys or indices.\n\n9. Encoding Issues: If the JSON file includes special characters or is not properly encoded in UTF-8, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n10. Large Files: If the JSON file is very large, it might be challenging to navigate and find the correct path quickly without tools to collapse or expand sections of the file.\n\nIt is important to carefully consider these potential issues when attempting to parse a JSON file and access specific values within it."
