Omitting a comma or adding an extra one can break the structure.\n\n2. **Improper Quotes:** Keys and string values in JSON should be enclosed in double quotes. Using single quotes or no quotes can lead to errors.\n\n3. **Unescaped Characters:** Special characters within strings should be escaped with a backslash (e.g., `\\\"` for a double quote inside a string).\n\n4. **Incorrect Brackets:** JSON uses curly braces to encapsulate objects and square brackets for arrays. Mismatched or incorrectly nested brackets can cause errors.\n\n5. **Trailing Commas:** While some parsers may tolerate trailing commas after the last element in an array or object, it is not valid in strict JSON.\n\n6. **Data Types Issues:** JSON supports specific data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, and null. Incorrectly formatting these values can result in errors.\n\n7. **Encoding Issues:** JSON text shall be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. If the encoding is incorrect, it might cause parsing issues.\n\n8. **Nested Objects/Arrays Complexity:** Deeply nested objects or arrays can make it harder to spot structural issues at a glance.\n\nTo provide an accurate assessment, I need to view the actual JSON input file to check for structural errors.
