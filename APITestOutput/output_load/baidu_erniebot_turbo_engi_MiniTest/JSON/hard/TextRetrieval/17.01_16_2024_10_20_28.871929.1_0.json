If the object with id \"n\" is deeply nested, it may require more complex parsing logic to locate it accurately.\n\n3. **Non-Unique IDs:** If the id \"n\" is not unique within the file, there could be multiple objects with the same id, which would require additional context or criteria to identify the correct one.\n\n4. **File Format Issues:** If the JSON file is not well-formed (e.g., missing brackets, commas, or quotes), it might not be parseable without correcting the format first.\n\n5. **Data Types:** JSON supports different data types such as objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null. Ensuring that the data associated with id \"n\" is interpreted with the correct type is essential.\n\n6. **Encoding and Special Characters:** If the JSON file contains special characters or is encoded in a way that isn't compatible with the parser, it could result in parsing errors or incorrect data interpretation.\n\n7. **Access to the File:** The JSON data needs to be accessible. If there are issues with file access permissions or if the file is hosted remotely and there are connectivity issues, it could prevent access to the content.\n\nWithout seeing the actual JSON file yet, these are some common challenges that might be faced.
