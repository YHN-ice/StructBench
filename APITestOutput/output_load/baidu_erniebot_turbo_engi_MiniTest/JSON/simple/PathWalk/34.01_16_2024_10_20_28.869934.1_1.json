Missing Data: The \"subs\" array might be missing or empty, or the first object in the \"subs\" array might not have an \"id\", which would make it impossible to provide an answer without handling these cases.\n\n4. Large File Size: If the JSON file is very large, it might be challenging to process it efficiently to quickly find the desired information.\n\n5. Data Types: The \"id\" field could have different data types (e.g., string or number), so the parser must be able to handle and return the correct type.\n\n6.
