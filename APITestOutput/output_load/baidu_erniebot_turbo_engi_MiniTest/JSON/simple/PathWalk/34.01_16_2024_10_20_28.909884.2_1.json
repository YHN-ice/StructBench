Then, we use the `next` function with the `iter` function to iterate over the \"subs\" key in the JSON data and find the first object with it. If the first object is found, we retrieve its \"id\" key and print it. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that no first object was found with the \"subs\" key.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that your JSON file is formatted correctly and that it contains the expected structure. If your JSON file has any formatting issues or missing keys, this code may not work as expected."
