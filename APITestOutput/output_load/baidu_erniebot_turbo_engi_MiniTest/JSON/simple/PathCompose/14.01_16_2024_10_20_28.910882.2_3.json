Each level of nesting requires additional brackets and keys or indices.\n\n2. **Similar Keys**: The presence of similar or identical keys at different levels of nesting can lead to confusion. It's important to keep track of the structure and the level at which a key exists.\n\n3. **Arrays vs Objects**: JSON can contain both arrays (ordered lists) and objects (unordered collections of key-value pairs). It's crucial to use the correct notation for accessing elements: square brackets for arrays (with indices) and dot notation or square brackets for objects (with keys).\n\n4. **Data Types**: The value associated with a key could be a string, number, another object, or an array. Each type requires different handling, especially when accessing elements within it.\n\n5. **Dynamic JSON Structure**: When dealing with JSON data whose structure is not known beforehand, it might be challenging to write generic code to access a value as the path to the value may not be fixed.\n\n6. **Typos and Case Sensitivity**: Keys in JSON are case-sensitive, and typos can prevent access to the correct value.\n\n7. **JSON Parsing Errors**: If the JSON is not properly formatted, parsing it might lead to errors which must be caught and handled.\n\n8. **Large JSON Files**: With large JSON files, performance may become an issue and finding the right key or index could be like looking for a needle in a haystack.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, careful analysis of the JSON structure is required, possibly with the help of tools that format and visualize JSON.
