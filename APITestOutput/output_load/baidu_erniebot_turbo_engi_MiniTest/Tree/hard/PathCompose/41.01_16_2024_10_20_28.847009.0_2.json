If there are multiple nodes with the same identifier, additional information would be needed to determine which path to trace.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The file may have errors or inconsistencies, such as missing nodes or broken links between parent and child nodes, which could lead to incorrect paths or an inability to find the node at all.\n\n5. **Large File Size**: If the tree file is very large, it might pose performance issues or require efficient algorithms to parse and search through the data without significant delays.\n\n6. **Ambiguity in Path Representation**: If the file does not clearly distinguish between different levels of the tree or sibling nodes, it might be difficult to represent the correct path using the requested format (e.g., A->D->H).\n\nIt's important to closely examine the input Tree file to overcome these potential obstacles.
