Incorrect or ambiguous tree structure: If the given Tree file contains an incorrect or unclear structure, it may be challenging to determine the relationships between nodes and, consequently, the depth of a specific node.\n\n2.

Non-standard file format: Tree structures can be represented in various formats (e.g., Newick, XML, JSON). If the file format is non-standard or not specified, it could be difficult to parse and interpret the data.\n\n4. Complex or large tree: A very complex or large tree with many nodes could make manual calculation of the depth time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n5. Inconsistent naming conventions: If node identifiers (like 'qc') are not consistently used throughout the tree, it could be hard to find the specific node in question.\n\n6.
