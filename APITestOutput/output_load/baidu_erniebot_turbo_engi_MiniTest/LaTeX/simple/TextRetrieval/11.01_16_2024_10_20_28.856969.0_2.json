The parser must handle all these variations.\n\n2. **Path Specifications**: The path to the figure files may be specified in absolute or relative terms, may include directories, and could have different file extensions. The parser must correctly interpret these paths.\n\n3. **Multiple Figures in One Command**: Sometimes, a single command might include multiple figures, especially when using commands that allow for specifying multiple files, such as in the case of subfigures.\n\n4. **Comments and Comments Blocks**: LaTeX allows comments using the `%` symbol. Lines or blocks of text commented out should not be parsed for figure filenames.\n\n5. **Figure Environments**: Figures are often enclosed within a `\\begin{figure}` and `\\end{figure}` environment. The parser needs to recognize when the figures are being included within these environments.\n\n6. **Optional Arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command and similar figure inclusion commands may contain optional arguments that specify aspects such as scaling, rotation, etc. These need to be ignored when extracting file names.\n\n7. **Conditional Inclusion**: Some LaTeX documents may conditionally include figures based on certain flags or commands. These conditions can affect whether a figure is actually included in the document.\n\n8. **Custom Commands and Macros**: A LaTeX document can define custom commands or macros that encapsulate figure inclusion within them. It would require understanding these custom definitions to correctly parse the included figures.\n\nTo ensure accurate parsing, the parser must be able to handle these complexities while extracting the figure filenames from the LaTeX source code."
