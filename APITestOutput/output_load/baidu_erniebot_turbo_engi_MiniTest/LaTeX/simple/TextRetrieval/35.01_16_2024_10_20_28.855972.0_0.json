A parser must handle all these variations.\n\n2. **Nested Commands**: Bold text commands can be nested within other commands or environments, which may make parsing more complex.\n\n3. **Comments and Escape Characters**: The parser must be able to ignore text within comments (lines starting with `%`) and handle escape characters (like `\\%` or `\\\\`) correctly.\n\n4. **Custom Commands**: There may be custom macros or commands defined in the preamble or elsewhere in the document that change the default behavior of the bold commands.\n\n5. **Multiple Lines**: The text that needs to be bold might span multiple lines, so the parser should be able to handle line breaks within the bold text commands.\n\n6. **Braces Matching**: LaTeX uses braces `{}` to delimit the scope of commands, so the parser must correctly match opening and closing braces, which can be challenging if there are many nested braces.\n\n7. **Other Formatting Inside Bold Texts**: Bold text blocks might contain other formatting commands or even environments, which need to be ignored or processed differently depending on the goal.\n\nOnce we see the input file, we'll need to address these potential issues to extract all bold texts accurately."
