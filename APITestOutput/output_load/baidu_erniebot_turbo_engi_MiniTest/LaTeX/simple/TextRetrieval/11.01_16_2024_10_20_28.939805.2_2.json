Each of these commands might have different syntaxes.\n2. **File path variations**: The figures could be located in different directories or have relative paths that may or may not include the file extension.\n3. **Optional arguments**: The `\\includegraphics` command can have optional arguments that alter how the figure is displayed. These options must be ignored to extract the file name.\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX allows comments using `%`. File names that appear in a comment should not be extracted as they are not actually included.\n5. **Multiple figures in one command**: Sometimes, figures are included side by side with the use of subfigure packages or other means, which can complicate the extraction of individual file names.\n6. **Custom commands or macros**: Users can define custom commands that wrap standard commands, potentially obscuring the inclusion of figures.\n7. **Environment-specific inclusions**: Figures might be included within environments (e.g., `figure`, `minipage`) which could affect the way they need to be parsed.\n\nGiven these complexities, the parser must be robust enough to handle these various cases to accurately extract all the included figure files from a LaTeX file."
