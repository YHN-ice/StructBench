Without processing these references, the content might include unresolved references like `\\ref{fig:example}`.\n\n4. **Comments**: LaTeX comments begin with `%` and are not part of the compiled document. It's important to distinguish between content and comments in the source file.\n\n5. **Conditional Compilation**: The content might be conditionally included or excluded using commands like `\\if`, `\\ifdef`, `\\ifndef`, `\\else`, `\\fi`, etc., which would require evaluating the conditions to determine the actual content.\n\n6. **Input and Include Commands**: LaTeX allows for modular document writing by including other files using `\\input{filename}` or `\\include{filename}` commands. This means that the complete content might not be in a single file.\n\n7. **Formatting Commands**: Commands that purely affect formatting (like `\\textbf`, `\\emph`, etc.) should be included in the excerpt, but their visual effect (bold, italic, etc.) will not be displayed in plaintext.\n\n8. **Sectioning Labels**: Sections and subsections can be labeled for cross-referencing; however, these labels (`\\label{sec:example}`) do not affect the displayed content but should be included in the extracted source.\n\nTo provide an accurate excerpt from the LaTeX file, these issues must be addressed.
