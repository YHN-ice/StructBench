Handling these correctly might be non-trivial.\n\n4. **Variations in Data Structure:** Not all branches of the YAML file may have the same depth or structure, so the parsing algorithm will need to handle this variability.\n\n5. **Alias Nodes:** YAML allows defining an alias for a node and then using that alias elsewhere in the document. This can make it challenging to determine the actual depth of a node.\n\n6. **Inheritance and Merging:** YAML has features to inherit and merge data from one part of the document to another, which could affect the apparent depth of a node.\n\n7. **Syntax Errors:** Incorrectly formatted YAML could lead to parsing errors, making it difficult to correctly identify nested objects.\n\n8. **Large Files:** If the YAML file is very large, it could pose performance issues for the parser, depending on its implementation.\n\nOnce I have access to the YAML file, these obstacles can be addressed, and I can then identify the most deeply nested objects without list or dictionary values."
