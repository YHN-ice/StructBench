Distinguishing between these types and correctly interpreting them is crucial.\n\n4. **Large Files**: If the YAML file is very large, it might be challenging to locate the specific object with the id 'v' without an efficient searching method.\n\n5. **Embedded Documents**: YAML allows for multiple documents to be included in a single file, separated by `---`. Ensuring that we are searching in the correct document is important.\n\n6. **External References**: Sometimes, YAML files might reference external files or include variables that are not explicitly defined within the document.\n\n7. **Special Characters**: Handling special characters and making sure they are correctly parsed and understood, especially in strings, is essential.\n\n8. **Comments**: YAML allows comments starting with `#`.
