Indentation: YAML relies on indentation for its structure, using spaces (not tabs) to nest elements. Incorrect or inconsistent indentation can cause errors.\n   \n2.

Dashes for Lists: Lists are denoted with a dash followed by a space. Missing spaces or incorrectly formatted lists can be problematic.\n   \n4. Data Types: YAML has different data types (string, boolean, integer, etc.). Errors can occur if a value is not in the correct format for its data type.\n   \n5. Duplicated Keys: Each key within a map must be unique. If there's a duplicated key, it's considered an error.\n   \n6. Scalars, Blocks, and Flow Collections: Scalars (single values) are simple, but block structures (using indentation) and flow collections (using brackets and commas) have their own rules and potential errors.\n   \n7. Multiline Strings: YAML has several ways to write multiline strings (e.g., with `|` for block format or `>` for folded format).
