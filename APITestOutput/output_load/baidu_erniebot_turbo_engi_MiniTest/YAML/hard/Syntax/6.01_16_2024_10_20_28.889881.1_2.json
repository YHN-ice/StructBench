If tabs are used, this will result in an error.\n\n3. **Key-Value Pair Syntax:** Improper formatting of key-value pairs, such as missing colons or incorrect alignment, can cause issues.\n\n4. **Data Types:** YAML has specific ways to represent different data types (strings, integers, booleans, etc.). Errors can occur if data is not correctly formatted, like missing quotes around strings that contain special characters.\n\n5. **Lists and Dictionaries:** The representation of lists and dictionaries must be consistent with the YAML syntax. Errors in using dashes or nested structures can cause parsing issues.\n\n6. **Duplicate Keys:** YAML does not allow duplicate keys within the same level of a map. If encountered, this would be a structural error.\n\n7. **Special Characters:** Special characters in strings may need to be escaped or quoted to be parsed correctly.\n\n8. **Complex Structures:** Complex nested structures may lead to confusion and mistakes if not carefully constructed.\n\n9. **Version and Compatibility:** YAML has different versions (e.g., 1.1, 1.2), and some features or syntax may differ between them, potentially causing compatibility issues.\n\n10. **Document Separators and Directives:** Incorrect use of document separators (`---`) or directives can cause errors.\n\nPlease provide the YAML content to be analyzed for structural errors."
