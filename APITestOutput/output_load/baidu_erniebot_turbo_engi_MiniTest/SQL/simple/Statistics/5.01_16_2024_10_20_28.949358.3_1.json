        "To answer your question, you will need to:\n\n1. Filter out duplicate entries for individuals by using the primeKey as a unique identifier.\n2. Determine the salary for each person and compare it to the threshold of 130607.\n\nGiven the provided data, here's how you can do that:\n\n1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of people with a salary above 130607.\n2. Iterate over each row in the \"salary\" column:\n\t* Extract the salary value from the row.\n\t* If the salary is greater than or equal to 130607, increment the counter variable by 1.\n3. After iterating over all rows, the counter variable will give you the number of people with a salary above 130607.\n\nHere's the code in pseudocode:\n\n\n```sql\ncounter = 0\n\nfor row in salary_column:\n    extract salary_value from row\n    if salary_value >= 130607:\n        counter = counter + 1\n\nprint counter\n```\nNote: The provided data contains several duplicate rows for individuals, so you'll need to handle those cases correctly to avoid double counting.\n\nRemember to provide the input file once you're ready to run the code!"
