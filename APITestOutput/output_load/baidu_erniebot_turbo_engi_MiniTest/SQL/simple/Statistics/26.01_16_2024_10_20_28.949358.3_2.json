Ambiguous Gender Identifiers: If the dataset uses non-standard or ambiguous gender identifiers, additional information might be needed to correctly interpret the gender.\n\n4. Multiple Rows per Person: If the table contains multiple rows for each person, we need to ensure that each individual is only counted once. Duplicate entries could lead to an inaccurate count.\n\n5.
