        "In this case, the data you provided includes the information of employees and their height, gender, age, name, status, salary, and location. The question you raised is about how many people who work in IL are taller than 173.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to perform a conditional count based on the provided criteria. We will need to filter out all the rows where the location is IL and the height is greater than 173.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the data provided contains multiple columns for each employee, and we need to make sure we're only counting people who meet both criteria. Therefore, we'll need to create a query that filters out all rows where either the height or location doesn't meet the criteria.\n\nTo do this, we can use SQL or a programming language like Python or R. Here's an example in SQL:\n\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM table_name\nWHERE location = 'IL' AND height > 173;\n```\nIn this query, `table_name` should be replaced with the actual name of your table, and the output will be the number of people who meet both criteria.\n\nThe difficulty of this task depends on the size and quality of your data, as well as any issues mentioned above. It may take some time to parse large datasets, but most programming languages and databases have methods for optimizing this process."
