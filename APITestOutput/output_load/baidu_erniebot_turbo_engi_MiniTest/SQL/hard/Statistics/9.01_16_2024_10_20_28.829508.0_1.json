Care must be taken to not count the same individual more than once if they have multiple entries with salaries above the threshold.\n\n6. **Error Handling:**\n   The parser needs to be robust against potential errors in the data, such as non-numeric characters in the salary field or unexpected null values.\n\n7. **PrimeKey Understanding:**\n   It is necessary to understand how the primeKey works to correctly identify unique individuals in the case of multiple records with the same primeKey.\n\n8. **Comparisons:**\n   Salary data needs to be accurately compared to the specified threshold of 122853, which could involve handling floating-point precision if salaries are not whole numbers.\n\n9. **Data Access:**\n   Depending on the storage and format of the datatable, accessing the data in an efficient manner could be a challenge.\n\n10. **Column Identification:**\n    Identifying which column represents salaries is necessary before any comparisons can be made.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, you would typically sanitize and validate the data, ensure proper data types are used for comparisons, handle duplicates appropriately, and implement efficient parsing algorithms.
