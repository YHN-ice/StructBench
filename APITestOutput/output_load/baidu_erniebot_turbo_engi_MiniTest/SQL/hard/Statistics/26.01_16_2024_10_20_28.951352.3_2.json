Inconsistent Data: The gender data might be inconsistent across the datatable entries. For example, some entries might use \"F\" for female, while others may use \"female\", \"woman\", etc.\n\n2. Missing Data: Some rows might have missing or null values in the gender column, which would require a decision on how to handle these cases.\n\n3. Duplicate Entries: If the datatable includes duplicate rows (with the same primeKey), care must be taken not to double-count individuals.\n\n4. Ambiguous Gender Indicators: The gender column might contain entries that are not clearly male or female, such as non-binary or transgender identifiers, which could complicate counting.\n\n5. Multiple Tables: If the data is spread across multiple tables, it will be necessary to join or combine these tables correctly based on the primeKey before counting.\n\n6. Data Formatting: The datatable could have formatting issues such as mixed types (strings and numbers), leading or trailing spaces, or inconsistent capitalization that may affect string matching.\n\n7. Errors in Data Entry: There may be typos or errors in the gender field, such as \"fmeale\" instead of \"female\".\n\n8.
